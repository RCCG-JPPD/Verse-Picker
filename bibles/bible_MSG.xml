		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="2">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Heaven and Earth were finished, down to the last detail. God had finished his work. On the seventh day he rested from all his work. God blessed the seventh day. He made it a Holy Day Because on that day he rested from his work, all the creating God had done. This is the story of how it all started, of Heaven and Earth when they were created. &amp;apos;Finally! Bone of my bone, flesh of my flesh! Name her Woman for she was made from Man.&amp;apos; Therefore a man leaves his father and mother and embraces his wife. They become one flesh. The two of them, the Man and his Wife, were naked, but they felt no shame.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">God took the Man and set him down in the Garden of Eden to work the ground and keep it in order.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="3">
			<VERS vnumber="1">The serpent was clever, more clever than any wild animal God had made. He spoke to the Woman: &amp;apos;Do I understand that God told you not to eat from any tree in the garden?&amp;apos; God said to the Woman, &amp;apos;What is this that you&amp;quot;ve done?&amp;apos; &amp;apos;Because you&amp;quot;ve done this, you&amp;quot;re cursed, cursed beyond all cattle and wild animals, Cursed to slink on your belly and eat dirt all your life. I&amp;quot;m declaring war between you and the Woman, between your offspring and hers. He&amp;quot;ll wound your head, you&amp;quot;ll wound his heel.&amp;apos; &amp;apos;I&amp;quot;ll multiply your pains in childbirth; you&amp;quot;ll give birth to your babies in pain. You&amp;quot;ll want to please your husband, but he&amp;quot;ll lord it over you.&amp;apos; &amp;apos;Because you listened to your wife and ate from the tree That I commanded you not to eat from, &amp;quot;Don&amp;quot;t eat from this tree,&amp;quot; The very ground is cursed because of you; getting food from the ground Will be as painful as having babies is for your wife; you&amp;quot;ll be working in pain all your life long. The ground will sprout thorns and weeds, you&amp;quot;ll get your food the hard way, Planting and tilling and harvesting, sweating in the fields from dawn to dusk, Until you return to that ground yourself, dead and buried; you started out as dirt, you&amp;quot;ll end up dirt.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">When the Woman saw that the tree looked like good eating and realized what she would get out of it&amp;ndash;she&amp;quot;d know everything!&amp;ndash;she took and ate the fruit and then gave some to her husband, and he ate.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Immediately the two of them did &amp;apos;see what&amp;quot;s really going on&amp;apos;&amp;ndash;saw themselves naked! They sewed fig leaves together as makeshift clothes for themselves.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">When they heard the sound of God strolling in the garden in the evening breeze, the Man and his Wife hid in the trees of the garden, hid from God .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">God called to the Man: &amp;apos;Where are you?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">He said, &amp;apos;I heard you in the garden and I was afraid because I was naked. And I hid.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">God said, &amp;apos;Who told you that you were naked? Did you eat from that tree I told you not to eat from?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">The Man said, &amp;apos;The Woman you gave me as a companion, she gave me fruit from the tree, and, yes, I ate it.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">&amp;apos;The serpent seduced me,&amp;apos; she said, &amp;apos;and I ate.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">He told the Woman:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">The Man, known as Adam, named his wife Eve because she was the mother of all the living.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">God made leather clothing for Adam and his wife and dressed them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">God said, &amp;apos;The Man has become like one of us, capable of knowing everything, ranging from good to evil. What if he now should reach out and take fruit from the Tree-of-Life and eat, and live forever? Never&amp;ndash;this cannot happen!&amp;apos;</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="4">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Adam slept with Eve his wife. She conceived and had Cain. She said, &amp;apos;I&amp;quot;ve gotten a man, with God &amp;quot;s help!&amp;apos; He said, &amp;apos;How should I know? Am I his babysitter?&amp;apos; Enoch had Irad, Irad had Mehujael, Mehujael had Methushael, Methushael had Lamech. Adah and Zillah, listen to me; you wives of Lamech, hear me out: I killed a man for wounding me, a young man who attacked me. If Cain is avenged seven times, for Lamech it&amp;quot;s seventy-seven! That&amp;quot;s when men and women began praying and worshiping in the name of God .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Then she had another baby, Abel. Abel was a herdsman and Cain a farmer.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Cain had words with his brother. They were out in the field; Cain came at Abel his brother and killed him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">God said to Cain, &amp;apos;Where is Abel your brother?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">God told him, &amp;apos;No. Anyone who kills Cain will pay for it seven times over.&amp;apos; God put a mark on Cain to protect him so that no one who met him would kill him.</VERS>

I am.&amp;apos; Ahhh. The smell of my son is like the smell of the open country blessed by God . May God give you of Heaven&amp;quot;s dew and Earth&amp;quot;s bounty of grain and wine. May peoples serve you and nations honor you. You will master your brothers, and your mother&amp;quot;s sons will honor you. Those who curse you will be cursed, those who bless you will be blessed. &amp;apos;I am your son, your firstborn, Esau.&amp;apos; He begged, &amp;apos;Haven&amp;quot;t you kept back any blessing for me?&amp;apos; You&amp;quot;ll live far from Earth&amp;quot;s bounty, remote from Heaven&amp;quot;s dew.

Mountains leapt before God , the Sinai God, before God , the God of Israel. and in the time of Jael, Public roads were abandoned, travelers went by backroads. Warriors became fat and sloppy, no fight left in them. Then you, Deborah, rose up; you got up, a mother in Israel. God chose new leaders, who then fought at the gates. And not a shield or spear to be seen among the forty companies of Israel. with abandon, volunteering yourselves with the people&amp;ndash;bless God ! * * * comfortably mounted on blankets And you who walk down the roads, ponder, attend! Gather at the town well and listen to them sing, Chanting the tale of God &amp;quot;s victories, his victories accomplished in Israel. Then the people of God went down to the city gates. Wake up, wake up, sing a song! On your feet, Barak! Take your prisoners, son of Abinoam! * * * The people of God joined the mighty ones. The captains from Ephraim came to the valley, behind you, Benjamin, with your troops. Captains marched down from Makir, from Zebulun high-ranking leaders came down. Issachar&amp;quot;s princes rallied to Deborah, Issachar stood fast with Barak, backing him up on the field of battle. But in Reuben&amp;quot;s divisions there was much second-guessing. Why all those campfire discussions? Diverted and distracted, Reuben&amp;quot;s divisions couldn&amp;quot;t make up their minds. Gilead played it safe across the Jordan, and Dan, why did he go off sailing? Asher kept his distance on the seacoast, safe and secure in his harbors. But Zebulun risked life and limb, defied death, as did Naphtali on the battle heights. the kings of Canaan fought. At Taanach they fought, at Megiddo&amp;quot;s brook, but they took no silver, no plunder. The stars in the sky joined the fight, from their courses they fought against Sisera. The torrent Kishon swept them away, the torrent attacked them, the torrent Kishon. Oh, you&amp;quot;ll stomp on the necks of the strong! Then the hoofs of the horses pounded, charging, stampeding stallions. &amp;apos;Curse Meroz,&amp;apos; says God &amp;quot;s angel. &amp;apos;Curse, double curse, its people, Because they didn&amp;quot;t come when God needed them, didn&amp;quot;t rally to God &amp;quot;s side with valiant fighters.&amp;apos; * * * wife of Heber the Kenite, most blessed of homemaking women. He asked for water, she brought milk; In a handsome bowl, she offered cream. She grabbed a tent peg in her left hand, with her right hand she seized a hammer. She hammered Sisera, she smashed his head, she drove a hole through his temple. He slumped at her feet. He fell. He sprawled. He slumped at her feet. He fell. Slumped. Fallen. Dead. * * * a weary, anxious watch. &amp;apos;What&amp;quot;s keeping his chariot?

Where are all the miracle-wonders our parents and grandparents told us about, telling us, &amp;quot;Didn&amp;quot;t God deliver us from Egypt?&amp;quot; The fact is, God has nothing to do with us&amp;ndash;he has turned us over to Midian.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">But God faced him directly: &amp;apos;Go in this strength that is yours. Save Israel from Midian. Haven&amp;quot;t I just sent you?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Gideon said to him, &amp;apos; Me , my master? How and with what could I ever save Israel? Look at me. My clan&amp;quot;s the weakest in Manasseh and I&amp;quot;m the runt of the litter.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">God said to him, &amp;apos;I&amp;quot;ll be with you. Believe me, you&amp;quot;ll defeat Midian as one man.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Gideon went and prepared a young goat and a huge amount of unraised bread (he used over half a bushel of flour!). He put the meat in a basket and the broth in a pot and took them back under the shade of the oak tree for a sacred meal.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">The angel of God said to him, &amp;apos;Take the meat and unraised bread, place them on that rock, and pour the broth on them.&amp;apos; Gideon did it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">But God reassured him, &amp;apos;Easy now. Don&amp;quot;t panic. You won&amp;quot;t die.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">Then Gideon built an altar there to God and named it &amp;apos; God &amp;quot;s Peace.&amp;apos; It&amp;quot;s still called that at Ophrah of Abiezer.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">Gideon selected ten men from his servants and did exactly what God had told him. But because of his family and the people in the neighborhood, he was afraid to do it openly, so he did it that night.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">Early in the morning, the people in town were shocked to find Baal&amp;quot;s altar torn down, the Asherah pole beside it chopped down, and the prime bull burning away on the altar that had been built.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">They kept asking, &amp;apos;Who did this?&amp;apos;</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="13">Gideon arrived just in time to hear a man tell his friend a dream. He said, &amp;apos;I had this dream: A loaf of barley bread tumbled into the Midianite camp. It came to the tent and hit it so hard it collapsed. The tent fell!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">His friend said, &amp;apos;This has to be the sword of Gideon son of Joash, the Israelite! God has turned Midian&amp;ndash;the whole camp!&amp;ndash;over to him.&amp;apos;</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="23">Israelites rallied from Naphtali, from Asher, and from all over Manasseh. They had Midian on the run.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="25">So all the men of Ephraim rallied and captured the fords of the Jordan at Beth Barah. They also captured the two Midianite commanders Oreb (Raven) and Zeeb (Wolf).

			<VERS vnumber="20">Then he spoke to Jether, his firstborn: &amp;apos;Get up and kill them.&amp;apos; But he couldn&amp;quot;t do it, couldn&amp;quot;t draw his sword. He was afraid&amp;ndash;he was still just a boy.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Zebah and Zalmunna said, &amp;apos;Do it yourself&amp;ndash;if you&amp;quot;re man enough!&amp;apos; And Gideon did it. He stepped up and killed Zebah and Zalmunna. Then he took the crescents that hung on the necks of their camels.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">The Israelites said, &amp;apos;Rule over us, you and your son and your grandson. You have saved us from Midian&amp;quot;s tyranny.&amp;apos;</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="2">Saul conscripted enough men for three companies of soldiers. He kept two companies under his command at Micmash and in the Bethel hills. The other company was under Jonathan at Gibeah in Benjamin. He sent the rest of the men home.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">The Philistines rallied their forces to fight Israel: three companies of chariots, six companies of cavalry, and so many infantry they looked like sand on the seashore. They went up into the hills and set up camp at Micmash, east of Beth Aven.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="24">Saul did something really foolish that day. He addressed the army: &amp;apos;A curse on the man who eats anything before evening, before I&amp;quot;ve wreaked vengeance on my enemies!&amp;apos; None of them ate a thing all day.</VERS>

I&amp;quot;ve spotted the very king I want among his sons.&amp;apos; God said, &amp;apos;Take a heifer with you and announce, &amp;quot;I&amp;quot;ve come to lead you in worship of God , with this heifer as a sacrifice.&amp;quot; Make sure Jesse gets invited. I&amp;quot;ll let you know what to do next. I&amp;quot;ll point out the one you are to anoint.&amp;apos; &amp;apos;Well, yes, there&amp;quot;s the runt. But he&amp;quot;s out tending the sheep.&amp;apos; Samuel ordered Jesse, &amp;apos;Go get him. We&amp;quot;re not moving from this spot until he&amp;quot;s here.&amp;apos; God said, &amp;apos;Up on your feet! Anoint him! This is the one.&amp;apos; Samuel left and went home to Ramah.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="6">When they arrived, Samuel took one look at Eliab and thought, &amp;apos;Here he is! God &amp;quot;s anointed!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">But God told Samuel, &amp;apos;Looks aren&amp;quot;t everything. Don&amp;quot;t be impressed with his looks and stature. I&amp;quot;ve already eliminated him. God judges persons differently than humans do. Men and women look at the face; God looks into the heart.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Jesse then called up Abinadab and presented him to Samuel. Samuel said, &amp;apos;This man isn&amp;quot;t God &amp;quot;s choice either.&amp;apos;</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="44">&amp;apos;Come on,&amp;apos; said the Philistine. &amp;apos;I&amp;quot;ll make roadkill of you for the buzzards. I&amp;quot;ll turn you into a tasty morsel for the field mice.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="50">That&amp;quot;s how David beat the Philistine&amp;ndash;with a sling and a stone. He hit him and killed him. No sword for David!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="51">Then David ran up to the Philistine and stood over him, pulled the giant&amp;quot;s sword from its sheath, and finished the job by cutting off his head. When the Philistines saw that their great champion was dead, they scattered, running for their lives.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1">By the time David had finished reporting to Saul, Jonathan was deeply impressed with David&amp;ndash;an immediate bond was forged between them. He became totally committed to David. From that point on he would be David&amp;quot;s number-one advocate and friend. Saul kills by the thousand, David by the ten thousand! This made Saul angry&amp;ndash;very angry. He took it as a personal insult. He said, &amp;apos;They credit David with &amp;quot;ten thousands&amp;quot; and me with only &amp;quot;thousands.&amp;quot; Before you know it they&amp;quot;ll be giving him the kingdom!&amp;apos; From that moment on, Saul kept his eye on David.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Saul received David into his own household that day, no more to return to the home of his father.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Whatever Saul gave David to do, he did it&amp;ndash;and did it well. So well that Saul put him in charge of his military operations. Everybody, both the people in general and Saul&amp;quot;s servants, approved of and admired David&amp;quot;s leadership.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">One day Saul said to David, &amp;apos;Here is Merab, my eldest daughter. I want to give her to you as your wife. Be brave and bold for my sake. Fight God &amp;quot;s battles!&amp;apos; But all the time Saul was thinking, &amp;apos;The Philistines will kill him for me. I won&amp;quot;t have to lift a hand against him.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">David, embarrassed, answered, &amp;apos;Do you really mean that? I&amp;quot;m from a family of nobodies! I can&amp;quot;t be son-in-law to the king.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">The wedding day was set, but as the time neared for Merab and David to be married, Saul reneged and married his daughter off to Adriel the Meholathite.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Saul ordered his servants, &amp;apos;Get David off by himself and tell him, &amp;quot;The king is very taken with you, and everyone at court loves you. Go ahead, become the king&amp;quot;s son-in-law!&amp;quot;&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">The king&amp;quot;s servants told all this to David, but David held back. &amp;apos;What are you thinking of? I can&amp;quot;t do that. I&amp;quot;m a nobody; I have nothing to offer.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">Whenever the Philistine warlords came out to battle, David was there to meet them&amp;ndash;and beat them, upstaging Saul&amp;quot;s men. David&amp;quot;s name was on everyone&amp;quot;s lips.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="19">
			<VERS vnumber="6">Saul listened to Jonathan and said, &amp;apos;You&amp;quot;re right. As God lives, David lives. He will not be killed.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Jonathan sent for David and reported to him everything that was said. Then he brought David back to Saul and everything was as it was before.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">War broke out again and David went out to fight Philistines. He beat them badly, and they ran for their lives.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Saul stormed at Michal: &amp;apos;How could you play tricks on me like this? You sided with my enemy, and now he&amp;quot;s gotten away!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Michal said, &amp;apos;He threatened me. He said, &amp;quot;Help me out of here or I&amp;quot;ll kill you.&amp;quot;&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">That was reported back to Saul, and he dispatched more men. They, too, were soon prophesying. So Saul tried a third time&amp;ndash;a third set of men&amp;ndash;and they ended up mindlessly raving as well!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Fed up, Saul went to Ramah himself. He came to the big cistern at Secu and inquired, &amp;apos;Where are Samuel and David?&amp;apos;</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="20">
			<VERS vnumber="1">David got out of Naioth in Ramah alive and went to Jonathan. &amp;apos;What do I do now? What wrong have I inflicted on your father that makes him so determined to kill me?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">&amp;apos;Nothing,&amp;apos; said Jonathan. &amp;apos;You&amp;quot;ve done nothing wrong. And you&amp;quot;re not going to die. Really, you&amp;quot;re not! My father tells me everything. He does nothing, whether big or little, without confiding in me. So why would he do this behind my back? It can&amp;quot;t be.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">But David said, &amp;apos;Your father knows that we are the best of friends. So he says to himself, &amp;quot;Jonathan must know nothing of this. If he does, he&amp;quot;ll side with David.&amp;quot; But it&amp;quot;s true&amp;ndash;as sure as God lives, and as sure as you&amp;quot;re alive before me right now&amp;ndash;he&amp;quot;s determined to kill me.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Jonathan said, &amp;apos;Tell me what you have in mind. I&amp;quot;ll do anything for you.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">&amp;apos;Never!&amp;apos; exclaimed Jonathan. &amp;apos;I&amp;quot;d never do that! If I get the slightest hint that my father is fixated on killing you, I&amp;quot;ll tell you.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">David asked, &amp;apos;And whom will you get to tell me if your father comes back with a harsh answer?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">But the day after the New Moon, day two of the holiday, David&amp;quot;s seat was still empty. Saul asked Jonathan his son, &amp;apos;So where&amp;quot;s that son of Jesse? He hasn&amp;quot;t eaten with us either yesterday or today.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">Jonathan stood up to his father. &amp;apos;Why dead? What&amp;quot;s he done?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">Saul threw his spear at him to kill him. That convinced Jonathan that his father was fixated on killing David.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">Jonathan stormed from the table, furiously angry, and ate nothing the rest of the day, upset for David and smarting under the humiliation from his father.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">Jonathan said, &amp;apos;Go in peace! The two of us have vowed friendship in God &amp;quot;s name, saying, &amp;quot; God will be the bond between me and you, and between my children and your children forever!&amp;quot;&amp;apos;</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="21">
			<VERS vnumber="1">David went on his way and Jonathan returned to town. David went to Nob, to Ahimelech the Priest. Ahimelech was alarmed as he went out to greet David: &amp;apos;What are you doing here all by yourself&amp;ndash;and not a soul with you?&amp;apos; And at that, David shot out of there, running for his life from Saul. He went to Achish, king of Gath. When the servants of Achish saw him, they said, &amp;apos;Can this be David, the famous David? Is this the one they sing of at their dances? Saul kills by the thousand, David by the ten thousand!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">&amp;apos;I don&amp;quot;t have any regular bread on hand,&amp;apos; said the priest. &amp;apos;I only have holy bread. If your men have not slept with women recently, it&amp;quot;s yours.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">David said, &amp;apos;None of us has touched a woman. I always do it this way when I&amp;quot;m on a mission: My men abstain from sex. Even when it is an ordinary mission we do that&amp;ndash;how much more on this holy mission.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">So the priest gave them the holy bread. It was the only bread he had, Bread of the Presence that had been removed from God &amp;quot;s presence and replaced by fresh bread at the same time.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">One of Saul&amp;quot;s officials was present that day keeping a religious vow. His name was Doeg the Edomite. He was chief of Saul&amp;quot;s shepherds.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">David asked Ahimelech, &amp;apos;Do you have a spear or sword of any kind around here? I didn&amp;quot;t have a chance to grab my weapons. The king&amp;quot;s mission was urgent and I left in a hurry.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">The priest said, &amp;apos;The sword of Goliath, the Philistine you killed at Oak Valley&amp;ndash;that&amp;quot;s here! It&amp;quot;s behind the Ephod wrapped in a cloth. If you want it, take it. There&amp;quot;s nothing else here.&amp;apos;</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="5">The prophet Gad told David, &amp;apos;Don&amp;quot;t go back to the cave. Go to Judah.&amp;apos; David did what he told him. He went to the forest of Hereth.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="12">Saul said, &amp;apos;You listen to me, son of Ahitub!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">&amp;apos;Why have you ganged up against me with the son of Jesse, giving him bread and a sword, even praying with him for God &amp;quot;s guidance, setting him up as an outlaw, out to get me?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">The king said, &amp;apos;Death, Ahimelech! You&amp;quot;re going to die&amp;ndash;you and everyone in your family!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">The king ordered his henchmen, &amp;apos;Surround and kill the priests of God ! They&amp;quot;re hand in glove with David.

		<CHAPTER cnumber="23">
			<VERS vnumber="3">But David&amp;quot;s men said, &amp;apos;We live in fear of our lives right here in Judah. How can you think of going to Keilah in the thick of the Philistines?&amp;apos;</VERS>

Meanwhile, David moved again, this time to the wilderness of Maon. If anyone stands in your way, if anyone tries to get you out of the way, Know this: Your God-honored life is tightly bound in the bundle of God-protected life; But the lives of your enemies will be hurled aside as a stone is thrown from a sling. Then David sent for Abigail to tell her that he wanted her for his wife. David&amp;quot;s servants went to Abigail at Carmel with the message, &amp;apos;David sent us to bring you to marry him.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">Then David accepted the gift she brought him and said, &amp;apos;Return home in peace. I&amp;quot;ve heard what you&amp;quot;ve said and I&amp;quot;ll do what you&amp;quot;ve asked.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">She got up, and then bowed down, face to the ground, saying, &amp;apos;I&amp;quot;m your servant, ready to do anything you want. I&amp;quot;ll even wash the feet of my master&amp;quot;s servants!&amp;apos;</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="8">Abishai said, &amp;apos;This is the moment! God has put your enemy in your grasp. Let me nail him to the ground with his spear. One hit will do it, believe me; I won&amp;quot;t need a second!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">But David said to Abishai, &amp;apos;Don&amp;quot;t you dare hurt him! Who could lay a hand on God &amp;quot;s anointed and even think of getting away with it?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">David took the spear and water jug that were right beside Saul&amp;quot;s head, and they slipped away. Not a soul saw. Not a soul knew. No one woke up! They all slept through the whole thing. A blanket of deep sleep from God had fallen on them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Saul confessed, &amp;apos;I&amp;quot;ve sinned! Oh, come back, my dear son David! I won&amp;quot;t hurt you anymore. You&amp;quot;ve honored me this day, treating my life as most precious. And I&amp;quot;ve acted the fool&amp;ndash;a moral dunce, a real clown.&amp;apos;</VERS>

I&amp;quot;ll be out of his reach for good.&amp;apos; David would tell him, &amp;apos;Oh, the Negev of Judah,&amp;apos; or &amp;apos;The Negev of Jerahmeel,&amp;apos; or &amp;apos;The Negev of the Kenites.&amp;apos; He never left a single person alive lest one show up in Gath and report what David had really been doing. This is the way David operated all the time he lived in Philistine country.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Then David said to Achish, &amp;apos;If it&amp;quot;s agreeable to you, assign me a place in one of the rural villages. It doesn&amp;quot;t seem right that I, your mere servant, should be taking up space in the royal city.&amp;apos;</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1">During this time the Philistines mustered their troops to make war on Israel.

Bring me Samuel.&amp;apos; &amp;apos;I see a spirit ascending from the underground.&amp;apos; &amp;apos;An old man ascending, robed like a priest.&amp;apos; Saul knew it was Samuel. He fell down, face to the ground, and worshiped. &amp;apos;Because I&amp;quot;m in deep trouble,&amp;apos; said Saul. &amp;apos;The Philistines are making war against me and God has deserted me&amp;ndash;he doesn&amp;quot;t answer me any more, either by prophet or by dream. And so I&amp;quot;m calling on you to tell me what to do.&amp;apos; But when his servants joined the woman in urging him, he gave in to their pleas, picked himself up off the ground, and sat on the bed. The woman moved swiftly. She butchered a grain-fed calf she had, and took some flour, kneaded it, and baked some flat bread. Then she served it all up for Saul and his servants. After dining handsomely, they got up from the table and were on their way that same night.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="8">They presented the head of Ish-Bosheth to David at Hebron, telling the king, &amp;apos;Here&amp;quot;s the head of Ish-Bosheth, Saul&amp;quot;s son, your enemy.

			<VERS vnumber="12">David then issued orders to his soldiers. They killed the two&amp;ndash;chopped off their hands and feet, and hung the corpses at the pool in Hebron. But Ish-Bosheth&amp;quot;s head they took and buried in Abner&amp;quot;s tomb in Hebron.</VERS>

Even the blind and the lame could keep you out. You can&amp;quot;t get in here!&amp;apos; They had convinced themselves that David couldn&amp;quot;t break through.</VERS>

Abishai son of Zeruiah fought and defeated the Edomites in the Salt Valley. Eighteen thousand of them were killed. David set up a puppet government in Edom, and the Edomites became subjects under David. God gave David victory wherever he marched. Jehoshaphat son of Ahilud was clerk; Seraiah was secretary; And David&amp;quot;s sons were priests.</VERS>

I see. Tell Joab, &amp;quot;Don&amp;quot;t trouble yourself over this. War kills&amp;ndash;sometimes one, sometimes another&amp;ndash;you never know who&amp;quot;s next.

			<VERS vnumber="25">When the messenger completed his report of the battle, David got angry at Joab. He vented it on the messenger: &amp;apos;Why did you get so close to the city? Didn&amp;quot;t you know you&amp;quot;d be attacked from the wall? Didn&amp;quot;t you remember how Abimelech son of Jerub-Besheth got killed? Wasn&amp;quot;t it a woman who dropped a millstone on him from the wall and crushed him at Thebez? Why did you go close to the wall!&amp;apos;</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="4">&amp;apos;One day a traveler dropped in on the rich man. He was too stingy to take an animal from his own herds or flocks to make a meal for his visitor, so he took the poor man&amp;quot;s lamb and prepared a meal to set before his guest.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">David noticed that the servants were whispering behind his back, and realized that the boy must have died.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">David got up from the floor, washed his face and combed his hair, put on a fresh change of clothes, then went into the sanctuary and worshiped. Then he came home and asked for something to eat. They set it before him and he ate.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">His servants asked him, &amp;apos;What&amp;quot;s going on with you? While the child was alive you fasted and wept and stayed up all night. Now that he&amp;quot;s dead, you get up and eat.&amp;apos;</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="20">Her brother Absalom said to her, &amp;apos;Has your brother Amnon had his way with you? Now, my dear sister, let&amp;quot;s keep it quiet&amp;ndash;a family matter.

			<VERS vnumber="13">David and his men went on down the road, while Shimei followed along on the ridge of the hill alongside, cursing, throwing stones down on them, and kicking up dirt.</VERS>

God said, &amp;apos;This is because there is blood on Saul and his house, from the time he massacred the Gibeonites.&amp;apos; But David persisted: &amp;apos;What are you saying I should do for you?&amp;apos; And David agreed, &amp;apos;I&amp;quot;ll hand them over to you.&amp;apos; They did everything the king ordered to be done. That cleared things up: from then on God responded to Israel&amp;quot;s prayers for the land. Then David&amp;quot;s men swore to him, &amp;apos;No more fighting on the front lines for you! Don&amp;quot;t snuff out the lamp of Israel!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">So the king called the Gibeonites together for consultation. (The Gibeonites were not part of Israel; they were what was left of the Amorites, and protected by a treaty with Israel. But Saul, a fanatic for the honor of Israel and Judah, tried to kill them off.)</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">David addressed the Gibeonites: &amp;apos;What can I do for you? How can I compensate you so that you will bless God &amp;quot;s legacy of land and people?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">The Gibeonites replied, &amp;apos;We don&amp;quot;t want any money from Saul and his family. And it&amp;quot;s not up to us to put anyone in Israel to death.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Rizpah daughter of Aiah took rough burlap and spread it out for herself on a rock from the beginning of the harvest until the heavy rains started. She kept the birds away from the bodies by day and the wild animals by night.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Later there was another skirmish with the Philistines at Gob. That time Sibbecai the Hushathite killed Saph, another of the warriors descended from Rapha.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">At yet another battle with the Philistines at Gob, Elhanan son of Jaar, the weaver of Bethlehem, killed Goliath the Gittite whose spear was as big as a flagpole.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1">David prayed to God the words of this song after God saved him from all his enemies and from Saul. the castle in which I live, my rescuing knight. My God&amp;ndash;the high crag where I run for dear life, hiding behind the boulders, safe in the granite hideout; My mountaintop refuge, he saves me from ruthless men. and find myself safe and saved. devil waters rushed over me. Hell&amp;quot;s ropes cinched me tight; death traps barred every exit. to my God I cried out. From his palace he heard me call; my cry brought me right into his presence&amp;ndash; a private audience! the very heavens shook like leaves, Quaked like aspen leaves because of his rage. His nostrils flared, billowing smoke; his mouth spit fire. Tongues of fire darted in and out; he lowered the sky. He stepped down; under his feet an abyss opened up. He rode a winged creature, swift on wind-wings. He wrapped himself in a trenchcoat of black rain-cloud darkness. But his cloud-brightness burst through, a grand comet of fireworks. Then God thundered out of heaven; the High God gave a great shout. God shot his arrows&amp;ndash;pandemonium! He hurled his lightnings&amp;ndash;a rout! The secret sources of ocean were exposed, the hidden depths of earth lay uncovered The moment God roared in protest, let loose his hurricane anger. from sky to sea; he pulled me out Of that ocean of hate, that enemy chaos, the void in which I was drowning. They hit me when I was down, but God stuck by me. He stood me up on a wide-open field; I stood there saved&amp;ndash;surprised to be loved! when I placed all the pieces before him. When I cleaned up my act, he gave me a fresh start. Indeed, I&amp;quot;ve kept alert to God &amp;quot;s ways; I haven&amp;quot;t taken God for granted. Every day I review the ways he works, I try not to miss a trick. I feel put back together, and I&amp;quot;m watching my step. God rewrote the text of my life when I opened the book of my heart to his eyes. you&amp;quot;re straight with people who&amp;quot;re straight with you, You&amp;quot;re good to good people, you shrewdly work around the bad ones. You take the side of the down-and-out, but the stuck-up you take down a peg. God drives out the darkness. I smash the bands of marauders, I vault the high fences. What a God! His road stretches straight and smooth. Every God -direction is road-tested. Everyone who runs toward him Makes it. Are we not at bedrock? Is not this the God who armed me well, then aimed me in the right direction? Now I run like a deer; I&amp;quot;m king of the mountain. He shows me how to fight; I can bend a bronze bow! You protect me with salvation-armor; you touch me and I feel ten feet tall. You cleared the ground under me so my footing was firm. When I chased my enemies I caught them; I didn&amp;quot;t let go till they were dead men. I nailed them; they were down for good; then I walked all over them. You armed me well for this fight; you smashed the upstarts. You made my enemies turn tail, and I wiped out the haters. They cried &amp;apos;uncle&amp;apos; but Uncle didn&amp;quot;t come; They yelled for God and got no for an answer. I ground them to dust; they gusted in the wind. I threw them out, like garbage in the gutter. You rescued me from a squabbling people; you made me a leader of nations. People I&amp;quot;d never heard of served me; the moment they got wind of me they submitted. They gave up; they came trembling from their hideouts. my towering Salvation-God! This God set things right for me and shut up the people who talked back. He rescued me from enemy anger. You pulled me from the grip of upstarts, You saved me from the bullies. That&amp;quot;s why I&amp;quot;m thanking you, God , all over the world. That&amp;quot;s why I&amp;quot;m singing songs that rhyme your name. God&amp;quot;s king takes the trophy; God&amp;quot;s chosen is beloved. I mean David and all his children&amp;ndash; always.</VERS>

There are no more jugs.&amp;apos; Then the oil stopped. * * * She replied, &amp;apos;Nothing.

			<VERS vnumber="4">Naaman went straight to his master and reported what the girl from Israel had said.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="7">When the king of Israel read the letter, he was terribly upset, ripping his robe to pieces. He said, &amp;apos;Am I a god with the power to bring death or life that I get orders to heal this man from his disease? What&amp;quot;s going on here? That king&amp;quot;s trying to pick a fight, that&amp;quot;s what!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Elisha the man of God heard what had happened, that the king of Israel was so distressed that he&amp;quot;d ripped his robe to shreds.

			<VERS vnumber="14">So he did it. He went down and immersed himself in the Jordan seven times, following the orders of the Holy Man. His skin was healed; it was like the skin of a little baby. He was as good as new.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">He then went back to the Holy Man, he and his entourage, stood before him, and said, &amp;apos;I now know beyond a shadow of a doubt that there is no God anywhere on earth other than the God of Israel. In gratitude let me give you a gift.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">&amp;apos;As God lives,&amp;apos; Elisha replied, &amp;apos;the God whom I serve, I&amp;quot;ll take nothing from you.&amp;apos; Naaman tried his best to get him to take something, but he wouldn&amp;quot;t do it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">&amp;apos;Nothing&amp;quot;s wrong, but something&amp;quot;s come up.

			<VERS vnumber="10">So the king of Israel sent word concerning the place of which the Holy Man had warned him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">The king of Aram was furious over all this. He called his officers together and said, &amp;apos;Tell me, who is leaking information to the king of Israel? Who is the spy in our ranks?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">But one of his men said, &amp;apos;No, my master, dear king. It&amp;quot;s not any of us. It&amp;quot;s Elisha the prophet in Israel. He tells the king of Israel everything you say, even what you whisper in your bedroom.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">The king said, &amp;apos;Go and find out where he is. I&amp;quot;ll send someone and capture him.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Then he dispatched horses and chariots, an impressive fighting force. They came by night and surrounded the city.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Early in the morning a servant of the Holy Man got up and went out. Surprise! Horses and chariots surrounding the city! The young man exclaimed, &amp;apos;Oh, master! What shall we do?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">He said, &amp;apos;Don&amp;quot;t worry about it&amp;ndash;there are more on our side than on their side.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Then Elisha prayed, &amp;apos;O God , open his eyes and let him see.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">When the Arameans attacked, Elisha prayed to God , &amp;apos;Strike these people blind!&amp;apos; And God struck them blind, just as Elisha said.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Then Elisha called out to them, &amp;apos;Not that way! Not this city! Follow me and I&amp;quot;ll lead you to the man you&amp;quot;re looking for.&amp;apos; And he led them into Samaria.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">As they entered the city, Elisha prayed, &amp;apos;O God , open their eyes so they can see where they are.&amp;apos; God opened their eyes. They looked around&amp;ndash;they were trapped in Samaria!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">When the king of Israel saw them, he said to Elisha, &amp;apos;Father, shall I massacre the lot?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">&amp;apos;Not on your life!&amp;apos; said Elisha. &amp;apos;You didn&amp;quot;t lift a hand to capture them, and now you&amp;quot;re going to kill them? No sir, make a feast for them and send them back to their master.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">So he prepared a huge feast for them. After they ate and drank their fill he dismissed them. Then they returned home to their master. The raiding bands of Aram didn&amp;quot;t bother Israel anymore.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="27">He answered, &amp;apos;If God won&amp;quot;t help you, where on earth can I go for help? To the granary? To the dairy?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">Elisha was sitting at home, the elders sitting with him. The king had already dispatched an executioner, but before the man arrived Elisha spoke to the elders: &amp;apos;Do you know that this murderer has just now sent a man to take off my head? Look, when the executioner arrives, shut the door and lock it. Don&amp;quot;t I even now hear the footsteps of his master behind him?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">While he was giving his instructions, the king showed up, accusing, &amp;apos;This trouble is directly from God ! And what&amp;quot;s next? I&amp;quot;m fed up with God !&amp;apos;</VERS>

The market at the city gate will be buzzing.&amp;apos; &amp;apos;You&amp;quot;ll watch it with your own eyes,&amp;apos; he said, &amp;apos;but you will not eat so much as a mouthful!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">The attendant on whom the king leaned for support said to the Holy Man, &amp;apos;You expect us to believe that? Trapdoors opening in the sky and food tumbling out?&amp;apos;</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="10">So they went and called out at the city gate, telling what had happened: &amp;apos;We went to the camp of Aram and, surprise!&amp;ndash;the place was deserted. Not a soul, not a sound! Horses and donkeys left tethered and tents abandoned just as they were.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">One of his advisors answered, &amp;apos;Let some men go and take five of the horses left behind. The worst that can happen is no worse than what could happen to the whole city. Let&amp;quot;s send them and find out what&amp;quot;s happened.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">They took two chariots with horses. The king sent them after the army of Aram with the orders, &amp;apos;Scout them out; find out what happened.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">They went after them all the way to the Jordan. The whole way was strewn with clothes and equipment that Aram had dumped in their panicked flight. The scouts came back and reported to the king.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">The people then looted the camp of Aram. Food prices dropped overnight&amp;ndash;a handful of meal for a shekel; two handfuls of grain for a shekel&amp;ndash; God &amp;quot;s word to the letter!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">The king ordered his attendant, the one he leaned on for support, to be in charge of the city gate. The people, turned into a mob, poured through the gate, trampling him to death. It was exactly what the Holy Man had said when the king had come to see him.</VERS>

The prophet Isaiah son of Amoz paid him a visit and said, &amp;apos;Put your affairs in order; you&amp;quot;re about to die&amp;ndash;you haven&amp;quot;t long to live.&amp;apos; Remember, O God , who I am, what I&amp;quot;ve done! I&amp;quot;ve lived an honest life before you, My heart&amp;quot;s been true and steady, I&amp;quot;ve lived to please you; lived for your approval. And then the tears flowed. Hezekiah wept. They prepared the plaster, applied it to the boil, and Hezekiah was on his way to recovery. Hezekiah said, &amp;apos;They came from far away&amp;ndash;from Babylon.&amp;apos; &amp;apos;Everything,&amp;apos; said Hezekiah. &amp;apos;There isn&amp;quot;t anything I didn&amp;quot;t show them&amp;ndash;I gave them the grand tour.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Isaiah then said, &amp;apos;Prepare a plaster of figs.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Hezekiah said to Isaiah, &amp;apos;How do I know whether this is of God and not just the fig plaster? What confirming sign is there that God is healing me and that in three days I&amp;quot;ll walk into The Temple of God on my own legs?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">&amp;apos;This will be your sign from God ,&amp;apos; said Isaiah, &amp;apos;that God is doing what he said he&amp;quot;d do: Do you want the shadow to advance ten degrees on the sundial or go back ten degrees? You choose.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Hezekiah said, &amp;apos;It would be easy to make the sun&amp;quot;s shadow advance ten degrees. Make it go back ten degrees.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">So Isaiah called out in prayer to God , and the shadow went back ten degrees on Ahaz&amp;quot;s sundial.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">And then Isaiah the prophet showed up: &amp;apos;And just what were these men doing here? Where did they come from and why?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">&amp;apos;And what did they see in your palace?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Hezekiah said to Isaiah, &amp;apos;If God says it, it must be good.&amp;apos; But he was thinking to himself, &amp;apos;It won&amp;quot;t happen during my lifetime&amp;ndash;I&amp;quot;ll enjoy peace and security as long as I live.&amp;apos;</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="9">But the people didn&amp;quot;t listen. Manasseh led them off the beaten path into practices of evil even exceeding the evil of the pagan nations that God had earlier destroyed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">The final word on Manasseh was that he was an indiscriminate murderer. He drenched Jerusalem with the innocent blood of his victims. That&amp;quot;s on top of all the sins in which he involved his people. As far as God was concerned, he&amp;quot;d turned them into a nation of sinners.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="9">Then Shaphan the royal secretary came back to the king and gave him an account of what had gone on: &amp;apos;Your servants have bagged up the money that has been collected for The Temple; they have given it to the foremen to pay The Temple workers.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Then Shaphan the royal secretary told the king, &amp;apos;Hilkiah the priest gave me a book.&amp;apos; Shaphan proceeded to read it to the king.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="16">As Josiah looked over the scene, he noticed the tombs on the hillside. He ordered the bones removed from the tombs and had them cremated on the ruined altars, desacralizing the evil altars. This was a fulfillment of the word of God spoken by the Holy Man years before when Jeroboam had stood by the altar at the sacred convocation.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Then the king said, &amp;apos;And that memorial stone&amp;ndash;whose is that?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Josiah said, &amp;apos;Don&amp;quot;t trouble his bones.&amp;apos; So they left his bones undisturbed, along with the bones of the prophet from Samaria.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">The king now commanded the people, &amp;apos;Celebrate the Passover to God , your God, exactly as directed in this Book of the Covenant.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">Josiah scrubbed the place clean and trashed spirit-mediums, sorcerers, domestic gods, and carved figures&amp;ndash;all the vast accumulation of foul and obscene relics and images on display everywhere you looked in Judah and Jerusalem. Josiah did this in obedience to the words of God &amp;quot;s Revelation written in the book that Hilkiah the priest found in The Temple of God .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">There was no king to compare with Josiah&amp;ndash;neither before nor after&amp;ndash;a king who turned in total and repentant obedience to God , heart and mind and strength, following the instructions revealed to and written by Moses. The world would never again see a king like Josiah.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">Jehoahaz was twenty-three years old when he began to rule. He was king in Jerusalem for a mere three months. His mother&amp;quot;s name was Hamutal daughter of Jeremiah. She came from Libnah.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">In God &amp;quot;s opinion, he was an evil king, reverting to the evil ways of his ancestors.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="17">Then the king of Babylon made Jehoiachin&amp;quot;s uncle, Mattaniah, his puppet king, but changed his name to Zedekiah.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he started out as king. He was king in Jerusalem for eleven years. His mother&amp;quot;s name was Hamutal the daughter of Jeremiah. Her hometown was Libnah.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">As far as God was concerned Zedekiah was just one more evil king, a carbon copy of Jehoiakim.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">The source of all this doom to Jerusalem and Judah was God &amp;quot;s anger&amp;ndash; God turned his back on them as an act of judgment. And then Zedekiah revolted against the king of Babylon.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="25">Some time later&amp;ndash;it was in the seventh month&amp;ndash;Ishmael son of Nethaniah, the son of Elishama (he had royal blood in him), came back with ten men and killed Gedaliah, the traitor Jews, and the Babylonian officials who were stationed at Mizpah&amp;ndash;a bloody massacre.</VERS>

The rivers keep flowing to the same old place, and then start all over and do it again. Everything&amp;quot;s boring, utterly boring&amp;ndash; no one can find any meaning in it. Boring to the eye, boring to the ear. What was will be again, what happened will happen again. There&amp;quot;s nothing new on this earth. Year after year it&amp;quot;s the same old thing. Does someone call out, &amp;apos;Hey, this is new&amp;apos;? Don&amp;quot;t get excited&amp;ndash;it&amp;quot;s the same old story. Nobody remembers what happened yesterday.

His throne was flaming with fire, its wheels blazing. A river of fire poured out of the throne. Thousands upon thousands served him, tens of thousands attended him. The courtroom was called to order, and the books were opened. arriving in a whirl of clouds. He came to The Old One and was presented to him. He was given power to rule&amp;ndash;all the glory of royalty. Everyone&amp;ndash;race, color, and creed&amp;ndash;had to serve him. His rule would be forever, never ending. His kingly rule would never be replaced.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">&amp;apos;The first animal looked like a lion, but it had the wings of an eagle. While I watched, its wings were pulled off. It was then pulled erect so that it was standing on two feet like a man. Then a human heart was placed in it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">&amp;apos;Then I saw a second animal that looked like a bear. It lurched from side to side, holding three ribs in its jaws. It was told, &amp;quot;Attack! Devour! Fill your belly!&amp;quot;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">&amp;apos;Next I saw another animal. This one looked like a panther. It had four birdlike wings on its back. This animal had four heads and was made to rule.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">&amp;apos;After that, a fourth animal appeared in my dream. This one was a grisly horror&amp;ndash;hideous. It had huge iron teeth. It crunched and swallowed its victims. Anything left over, it trampled into the ground. It was different from the other animals&amp;ndash;this one was a real monster. It had ten horns.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">&amp;apos;As I was staring at the horns and trying to figure out what they meant, another horn sprouted up, a little horn. Three of the original horns were pulled out to make room for it. There were human eyes in this little horn, and a big mouth speaking arrogantly.</VERS>

This was now the second vision. * * * and rebellions heat up, A king will show up, hard-faced, a master trickster. His power will swell enormously. He&amp;quot;ll talk big, high-handedly, Doing whatever he pleases, knocking off heroes and holy ones left and right.

But when he takes on the Prince of all princes, he&amp;quot;ll be smashed to bits&amp;ndash; but not by human hands.

			<VERS vnumber="13">&amp;apos;Then I overheard two holy angels talking.

			<VERS vnumber="14">&amp;apos;The other answered, &amp;quot;Over the course of 2,300 sacrifices, evening and morning. Then the Sanctuary will be set right again.&amp;quot;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">&amp;apos;While I, Daniel, was trying to make sense of what I was seeing, suddenly there was a humanlike figure standing before me.</VERS>

You thought you were so great, perched high among the rocks, king of the mountain, Thinking to yourself, &amp;quot;Nobody can get to me! Nobody can touch me!&amp;quot; Think again. Even if, like an eagle, you hang out on a high cliff-face, Even if you build your nest in the stars, I&amp;quot;ll bring you down to earth.&amp;apos; God &amp;quot;s sure Word. they&amp;quot;d rob you blind&amp;ndash;isn&amp;quot;t that so? If they mugged you on the streets at night, they&amp;quot;d pick you clean&amp;ndash;isn&amp;quot;t that so? Oh, they&amp;quot;ll take Esau apart, piece by piece, empty his purse and pockets. All your old partners will drive you to the edge. Your old friends will lie to your face. Your old drinking buddies will stab you in the back. Your world will collapse. You won&amp;quot;t know what hit you.

Because of the murderous history compiled against your brother Jacob, You will be looked down on by everyone. You&amp;quot;ll lose your place in history. On that day you stood there and didn&amp;quot;t do anything. Strangers took your brother&amp;quot;s army into exile. Godless foreigners invaded and pillaged Jerusalem. You stood there and watched. You were as bad as they were. You shouldn&amp;quot;t have gloated over your brother when he was down-and-out. You shouldn&amp;quot;t have laughed and joked at Judah&amp;quot;s sons when they were facedown in the mud. You shouldn&amp;quot;t have talked so big when everything was so bad. You shouldn&amp;quot;t have taken advantage of my people when their lives had fallen apart. You of all people should not have been amused by their troubles, their wrecked nation. You shouldn&amp;quot;t have taken the shirt off their back when they were knocked flat, defenseless. And you shouldn&amp;quot;t have stood waiting at the outskirts and cut off refugees, And traitorously turned in helpless survivors who had lost everything. * * * for all the godless nations. As you have done, it will be done to you. What you did will boomerang back and hit your own head. Just as you partied on my holy mountain, all the godless nations will drink God&amp;quot;s wrath. They&amp;quot;ll drink and drink and drink&amp;ndash; they&amp;quot;ll drink themselves to death. But not so on Mount Zion&amp;ndash;there&amp;quot;s respite there! a safe and holy place! The family of Jacob will take back their possessions from those who took them from them. That&amp;quot;s when the family of Jacob will catch fire, the family of Joseph become fierce flame, while the family of Esau will be straw. Esau will go up in flames, nothing left of Esau but a pile of ashes.&amp;apos; God said it, and it is so. * * * people from the foothills will overrun the Philistines. They&amp;quot;ll take the farms of Ephraim and Samaria, and Benjamin will take Gilead. Earlier, Israelite exiles will come back and take Canaanite land to the north at Zarephath. Jerusalem exiles from the far northwest in Sepharad will come back and take the cities in the south. The remnant of the saved in Mount Zion will go into the mountains of Esau And rule justly and fairly, a rule that honors God &amp;quot;s kingdom.</VERS>
