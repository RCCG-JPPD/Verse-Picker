		<CHAPTER cnumber="1">
			<VERS vnumber="1">When God created the heavens and the earth,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">the earth was completely formless and empty, with nothing but darkness draped over the deep. God&amp;quot;s Spirit hovered over the face of the waters.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">And then God announced, &amp;apos;Let there be light,&amp;apos; and light burst forth!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">And God saw the light as pleasing and beautiful; he used the light to dispel the darkness.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">God called the light &amp;apos;Day,&amp;apos; and the darkness &amp;apos;Night.&amp;apos; And so, evening gave way to morning&amp;ndash;the first day.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">And God said, &amp;apos;Let there be a dome between the waters to separate the water above from the water below .&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">And God said, &amp;apos;Let the water beneath the sky be gathered into one place, and let the dry ground appear.&amp;apos; And so it happened.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">God called the dry ground &amp;apos;Land,&amp;apos; and the gathered waters he called &amp;apos;Seas.&amp;apos; And God saw the beauty of his creation, and he was very pleased.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Then God said, &amp;apos;Let the land burst forth with growth: plants that bear seeds of their own kind, and every variety of fruit tree, each with power to multiply from its own seed.&amp;apos; And so it happened.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">The land flourished with grasses, every variety of seed-bearing plant, and trees bearing fruit with their seeds in them. And God loved what he saw, for it was beautiful .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Evening gave way to morning&amp;ndash;day three.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">God made two great lights: the brighter light to rule the day and the lesser light to rule the night. He also spread the tapestry of shining stars</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">and set them all in the sky to illuminate the earth,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">to rule over the day and to rule over the night, and to separate the light from darkness. God loved what he saw, for it was beautiful .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Evening gave way to morning&amp;ndash;day four.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">God said, &amp;apos; Let there be life! Let the waters swarm with sea life, and let the sky be filled with soaring birds of every kind .&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">God created huge sea creatures and every living creature that moves of every kind&amp;ndash;swarming in the water and flying in the sky, according to their species. God loved what he saw, for it was beautiful .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">God blessed them, saying, &amp;apos;Reproduce and be fruitful! Fill the waters of the sea with life, and the earth with flying birds!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">Evening gave way to morning&amp;ndash;day five.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">God said, &amp;apos;Let the earth produce every class and kind of living creature: livestock, crawling things, wild animals, each after its kind.&amp;apos; And so it happened.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">God made the wild animals according to their species, livestock according to their species, and all the creatures that creep along the ground according to their species. And God loved what he saw, for it was beautiful .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">Then God said, &amp;apos;Let us make a man and a woman in our image to be like us. Let them reign over the fish of the sea, the birds of the air, the livestock, over the creatures that creep along the ground, and over the wild animals.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">So God created man and woman and shaped them with his image inside them. In his own beautiful image, he created his masterpiece . Yes , male and female he created them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">And God blessed them in his love , saying, &amp;apos;Reproduce and be fruitful! Populate the earth and subdue it! Reign over the fish of the sea, the birds of the air, and every creature that lives on earth.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">And God said, &amp;apos;I give you every seed-bearing plant growing throughout the earth, vegetables, and every fruit-bearing tree with its seed within itself. They will be your food.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">They will also be food for every animal and bird, and every creature that moves on the ground&amp;ndash;every creature with the breath of life.&amp;apos; And so it happened.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">God surveyed all he had made and said, &amp;apos;I love it!&amp;apos; For it pleased him greatly. Evening gave way to morning&amp;ndash;day six.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="2">
			<VERS vnumber="1">And so the creation of the heavens and the earth were completed in all their vast array.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">By the seventh day, God had completed creating his masterpiece, so on the seventh day, he rested from all his work.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">So God blessed the seventh day and made it sacred, because on it, he paused to rest from all his work of creation.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">This is the account of the heavens and the earth after they were created. At the time Yahweh -God created earth and heaven, for she was taken from man.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">there was yet no vegetation, grains of the field, or shrubs sprouting on the earth, for there was no one to cultivate the land, and Yahweh -God had not yet sent rain.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">In those days a mist arose from the soil and watered the whole face of the ground.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Yahweh -God scooped up a lump of soil, sculpted a man, and blew into his nostrils the breath of life. The man came alive&amp;ndash;a living soul!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Then Yahweh -God planted a lush garden paradise in the East, in the Land of Delight, and there he placed the man he had formed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Yahweh -God made all kinds of beautiful trees to grow there&amp;ndash;fruitful trees to satisfy the taste. In the middle of the garden, he planted the Tree of Life and the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Flowing from the Land of Delight was a river to water the garden, and from there, it divided into four branches.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">The first river, Overflowing Increase, encircles the gold-laden land of Havilah.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">The gold of that land is pure, with many pearls and onyx found there.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">The second river, Gushing, flows through the entire land of Cush.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">The third river, Swift Flowing, flows east of Assyria. And the fourth is the river Fruitfulness.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Yahweh -God took the man and placed him in the garden of Eden to work and watch over it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">And Yahweh -God commanded him, &amp;apos;You may freely eat of every fruit of the garden.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">But you must not eat of the Tree that gives the knowledge of good and evil, for when you eat from it you will most certainly die.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Then Yahweh -God said, &amp;apos;It is not good for the man to be alone. Therefore, I will fashion a suitable partner to be his help and strength.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">For Yahweh -God had formed from the soil every animal of the field and every bird of the air and brought them before the man to see what he would call them. So, whatever the man called the living creature, that was its name.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">He gave names to all the various cattle, birds, and wild animals, but Adam could not find a fitting companion that corresponded to him .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">So Yahweh -God caused Adam to fall into a deep trance, and while he slept, he took a portion of Adam&amp;quot;s side and closed its place with flesh.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Then Yahweh -God used the portion of Adam&amp;quot;s side and skillfully crafted a woman and presented her to him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">Then Adam said: &amp;apos;At last! One like me! Her bones were formed from my bones, and her flesh from my flesh! This one will be called &amp;quot;Woman,&amp;quot;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">For this reason, a man leaves his father and his mother to be unselfishly attached to his wife. They become one flesh as a new family !</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">The man and his wife felt no shame, unaware that they were both naked.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="3">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Now the snake was the most cunning of all living beings that Yahweh -God had made. He deviously asked the woman, &amp;apos;Did God really tell you, &amp;quot;You must not eat fruit from any tree of the garden&amp;ndash;?&amp;quot; &amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">But the woman interrupted , &amp;apos;&amp;ndash;We may eat the fruit of any tree in the garden,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">except the tree in the center of the garden. God told us, &amp;quot;Don&amp;quot;t eat its fruit, or even touch it, or you&amp;quot;ll die.&amp;quot; &amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">But the snake said to her, &amp;apos;You certainly won&amp;quot;t die.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">God knows that the moment you eat it, your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing both good and evil.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">When the woman saw that the tree produced delicious fruit, delightful to look upon, and desirable to give one insight, she took its fruit and ate it. She gave some to her husband, who was with her, and he also ate it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Immediately , their eyes were opened, and they realized they were naked, vulnerable, and ashamed ; so they sewed fig leaves together for coverings.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Then Adam and his wife heard the sound of Yahweh -God passing through the garden in the breeze of the day. So, they hid among the trees concealing themselves from the face of Yahweh -God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Then Yahweh -God called Adam&amp;quot;s name and asked, &amp;apos;Where are you?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Adam answered, &amp;apos;I heard your powerful presence moving in the garden, and I was afraid because I was naked; so I hid.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">&amp;apos;Who told you that you were naked?&amp;apos; God said. &amp;apos;Did you eat the fruit of the tree that I commanded you not to eat?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Adam pointed to the woman and said, &amp;apos;The woman you placed alongside me&amp;ndash; she gave me fruit from the tree, &amp;apos;What have you done?&amp;apos; The woman pointed to the snake and said, &amp;apos;The shining snake tricked me, and I ate.&amp;apos; &amp;apos;Because you have done this, you are cursed above every wild animal, condemned above every creature of the field! You will slither on your belly He will crush your head &amp;apos;Because you obeyed your wife instead of me , and you ate from the forbidden tree when I had commanded you not to, the ground will be cursed because of you. and you will eat the plants of the field. until your body&amp;ndash;taken from the ground&amp;ndash;returns to the ground. For you are from dust, and I ate it.&amp;apos; and eat dust all the days of your life! and between her seed and yours. as you crush his heel.&amp;apos; &amp;apos;I will cause your labor pains in childbirth to be intensified; with pain you will give birth to children. You will desire to dominate your husband, but he will want to dominate you.&amp;apos; You will eat of it through painful toil all the days of your life. to produce food to eat, and to dust you will return.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">So Yahweh -God said to the woman,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Yahweh -God then said to the snake,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">And I will place great hostility between you and the woman,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Then God said to the woman,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">And to Adam he said,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">It will sprout weeds and thorns,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">You will painfully toil and sweat</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">The man named his wife Eve&amp;ndash; &amp;apos;Life-Giver,&amp;apos; because she would become the mother of every human being.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Yahweh -God made garments from animal skins to clothe Adam and Eve.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">And Yahweh -God said, &amp;apos;The man has become like one of us, knowing good and evil. And now he might take in his hands fruit from the Tree of Life, and eat it, and live forever.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">Therefore, Yahweh -God expelled him from Eden&amp;quot;s paradise to till the ground from which he was taken.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">He drove them out of the garden, and placed fearsome angelic sentries east of the garden of Eden, with a turning fiery sword to guard the way to the Tree of Life.</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="4">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Now Adam had slept with his wife, and she conceived and bore a son named Cain. She said, &amp;apos;By the grace of Yahweh I have birthed a man!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Then later, she gave birth to Cain&amp;quot;s brother Abel. Abel grew up to be a shepherd, and Cain became a farmer, working the ground.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">After some time passed, Cain presented an offering to Yahweh from the produce of the land.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Abel also brought his offering, from among the finest of the firstborn of his flocks. Yahweh was very pleased with Abel and accepted his offering,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">but with Cain and his offering, Yahweh was not pleased, making Cain very furious and resentful.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">So Yahweh said to Cain, &amp;apos;Why are you so angry and bothered? But if you refuse to offer what is right, It desires to have you, yet you must be its master.&amp;apos; &amp;apos;Listen to me, Dawn and Dusk! Mark my words, O wives of Lamech! I have killed a man for wounding me,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">If you offer what is right, won&amp;quot;t you be accepted? sin, the predator , is crouching in wait outside the door of your heart . He answered, &amp;apos;How do I know? Am I my brother&amp;quot;s keeper?&amp;apos; and a young man for bruising me. for Lamech, it will cost seventy-seven!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">One day Cain said to his brother, &amp;apos;Let&amp;quot;s go out into the field.&amp;apos; When they arrived at the field, Cain rose and attacked and killed his brother Abel.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Then Yahweh said to Cain, &amp;apos;Where is your brother Abel?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Yahweh said, &amp;apos;Listen&amp;ndash;the voice of your brother&amp;quot;s blood is crying out to me from the ground! What have you done?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Now you are banished from the land, from the very ground that drank your brother&amp;quot;s blood from your hand!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">When you try to cultivate the ground it will no longer produce crops for you; and you will be a fugitive, a homeless wanderer!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Cain said to Yahweh , &amp;apos;My punishment is more than I can bear!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Look&amp;ndash;you&amp;quot;ve thrown me off the land today, and now I must hide from your presence. As a fugitive and wanderer on the earth, anyone who meets me may choose to kill me!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Yahweh responded, &amp;apos;Not so! If anyone kills you, I promise the seven-fold vengeance of Cain will be released upon him!&amp;apos; So, Yahweh put an identifying sign on Cain as a warning so that no one would dare kill him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Then Cain left the presence of Yahweh and journeyed to the Land of Wandering, east of Eden.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Cain slept with his wife and she conceived and bore Enoch. Cain was building a city at the time, so he named it the Village of Enoch, after his son.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Enoch&amp;quot;s son was Irad, and Irad&amp;quot;s son was Mehujael, and Mehujael&amp;quot;s son was Methushael, and Methushael&amp;quot;s son was Lamech.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Lamech married two women, Dawn and Dusk.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Dawn gave birth to Jabal, the first of those who lived in tents and raised livestock.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Jabal&amp;quot;s brother was Jubal, the first of musicians who played instruments.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Dusk gave birth to Tubalcain, the first of blacksmiths who forged all kinds of bronze and iron tools. His sister was Naamah.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">Lamech boasted to his wives:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">If killing Cain costs seven lives,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">Adam slept with his wife again and she bore a son whom she named Seth, meaning &amp;apos;appointed,&amp;apos; for she declared, &amp;apos;God has appointed for me another son to replace Abel, because Cain killed him.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">After many years Seth had a son named Enosh. During his lifetime, people began to worship Yahweh and pray to him.</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="6">
			<VERS vnumber="1">When people began to populate the earth, they had many lovely daughters.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Divine beings found them very appealing, so they took the women they wanted as their wives.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Yahweh said, &amp;apos;My Spirit will not strive with humanity indefinitely, for they are mortal. Their life span will be shortened to only one hundred and twenty years.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Back then, and later, there were giants on the earth, who were born as a result of the unholy union of heavenly beings with the human daughters. They were the mighty ones of old, warriors of renown.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">But Yahweh saw how extremely wicked humanity had become, for they imagined only evil, for all they thought about was doing evil all the time.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">And Yahweh was saddened that he had made humanity, and his heart was filled with pain.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">So Yahweh decided, &amp;apos;I will do away with my ruined creation &amp;ndash;human beings that I created&amp;ndash;people and animals, creeping things and flying birds, for it breaks my heart that I made them!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">But one man discovered grace before the face of Yahweh : Noah.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">This is the story of Noah. Noah was a godly man of integrity, without fault in his generation, and he lived close to God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Noah had three sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Injustice and violence filled the world; the earth was ruined in the sight of God,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">for he saw how debased the world had become, for everyone was corrupt to the core.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">So God said to Noah, &amp;apos;I have decided that all living creatures must die, for their violence has filled the earth, and I will wipe them off the face of the earth!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Cover it with a roof, but leave a gap of eighteen inches at the top for ventilation . Construct a door on the side of the ark, and design it with lower, middle, and upper decks.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">I am going to release a great flood that will destroy all life upon the earth, and every breathing thing under heaven will perish&amp;ndash;everything on earth will die.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">But as for you, I will establish my covenant of friendship , and you will escape destruction by coming into the ark, you and your wife, your sons and their wives.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Bring with you into the ark a pair of every animal, male and female; and they will also be spared.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Different kinds of birds, animals large and small &amp;ndash;two of every kind I will send to you to be kept alive.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Also take with you every kind of food, both for you and them.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">So Noah completed all these preparations and did everything exactly as God had commanded him.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="7">
			<VERS vnumber="1">The day came when Yahweh said to Noah, &amp;apos;Come into the ark, you and your entire household, for I have found you to be the only one righteous in my eyes in this generation.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Take with you seven pairs of all the clean animals, both male and female, and one pair of all the unclean animals, both male and female.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Take seven pairs of flying birds of all kinds, male and female, to make sure they survive on the earth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">For in seven days I will send rain and flood the earth for forty days and forty nights. Every living thing that I made I will wipe off the face of the earth.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Noah obeyed all that Yahweh had commanded him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Noah was six hundred years old when the great flood came on the earth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Noah and his wife and his sons and their wives boarded the ark to escape the flood.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Then seven days later, massive floodwaters covered the earth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">It started in the six hundredth year of Noah&amp;quot;s life, in the second month on the seventeenth day. On that day , all the fountains of the subterranean deep cracked open and burst up through the ground. Heaven&amp;quot;s floodgates were opened,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">and heavy rains fell on the earth for forty days and forty nights.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">On that very day, Noah and his wife, their sons, Ham, Shem, and Japheth, and their wives, entered safely into the ark.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Both male and female went inside as God had commanded Noah; and Yahweh himself shut them in.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">For forty days, the flood engulfed the earth. The swelling floodwaters lifted up the ark until it rose high above the ground.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">The raging flood completely inundated the earth, but the ark floated safely , drifting upon the surface of the water,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">until the highest mountains were completely submerged beneath the rising waters.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">The waters rose over twenty-two feet above the highest mountains.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Every living thing on the earth perished&amp;ndash;domesticated animals, wild animals, birds, everything that moved on the earth, and all mankind perished.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Everything perished&amp;ndash;every animal on earth with the breath of life in its nostrils died.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">All life on earth was blotted out&amp;ndash;all that he had made, animals large and small, wild and domesticated, birds and reptiles, including humanity, was wiped off the face of the earth. Only Noah was left behind, and those who were in the ark with him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">And the waters covered the earth for 150 days.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="8">
			<VERS vnumber="1">God&amp;quot;s heart was moved with compassion as he remembered Noah and all the animals, large and small, that were with him in the ark. And God caused a wind to sweep across the earth again and the waters subsided.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">He closed the subterranean fountains and the floodgates of heaven and held back the rain.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">After 150 days, the floodwaters gradually receded from the earth and the waters began to subside.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">And on the seventeenth day of the seventh month, the ark came to rest on the highest peak in Ararat.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">The waters continued to recede until the tenth month. And on the first day of the tenth month, all the mountaintops appeared.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">After forty more days Noah opened the window he had made in the ark</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">and released a raven. It flew back and forth from the ark until the earth was dry.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Then he sent out a dove to see if the waters had receded from the surface of the ground.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">But the dove found no place to rest, so it returned to Noah in the ark because the waters still covered the face of the earth. Noah put out his hand and grasped the dove and put it back into the ark.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">He waited another seven days and released the dove from the ark again.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Before evening, the dove came back to him&amp;ndash;and there in its beak was a freshly plucked olive leaf! So Noah realized that the waters had finally subsided from the earth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Then he waited another seven days and sent the dove out again, but this time it did not return to him in the ark.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">In Noah&amp;quot;s six hundred and first year, on the first day of the first month, the waters were dried up from the earth. Noah lifted the hatch, looked out, and saw the dry ground.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">On the twenty-seventh day of the second month, the earth was dry.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Then God said to Noah,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">&amp;apos;Come out of the ark, you and your wife, your sons, and their wives.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="10">At that time, a severe famine struck the land of Canaan, forcing Abram to travel down to Egypt and live there as a foreigner .</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="9">Look at the vast land that is in front of you! Let&amp;quot;s settle in different regions. If you choose the land on the left, then I&amp;quot;ll go right, and if you want land on the right, then I&amp;quot;ll go left.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Lot lifted his eyes and carefully surveyed the land around him all the way to Zoar. He noticed that the Jordan Valley was fertile and well-watered (this was before Yahweh had destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah). It looked beautiful , like the garden of Yahweh , or like Egypt.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="9">The angel of Yahweh told her, &amp;apos;You have to go back to your mistress and humbly submit to her.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">The angel added, &amp;apos;I will greatly multiply your descendants until no one can count them.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Yahweh &amp;quot;s angel continued, &amp;apos;You are now pregnant, and soon you will give birth to a son. You will name him Ishmael, for Yahweh has heard your cries of distress.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Your son will have a wild nature that no one can tame. He will be hostile toward everyone, and everyone will be hostile toward him; and he will live at odds with all his kinsmen.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">After her encounter with Yahweh , Hagar called him by a special name, &amp;apos;You are the God of My Seeing,&amp;apos; for she said, &amp;apos;Oh my, did I just see God and live to talk about it?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">That is why the well is called Spring of the Living One Who Watches Over Me. The well is still there, between Kadesh and Bered.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1">When Abram was ninety-nine years old, Yahweh appeared to him again and said, &amp;apos;I am the God who is more than enough. Live your life in my presence and be blameless.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">I will confirm my covenant between me and you, and I will greatly multiply your descendants.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Then Abram fell on his face in awe before God, and God said to him,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">&amp;apos;I establish my covenant with you: &amp;apos;You will become a father of many nations. for I have made you a father of many nations. I will make nations out of you, and it will extend to your descendants throughout their generations. the land to which you have migrated. as an everlasting possession. And I will be their God forever !&amp;apos; &amp;apos;Concerning your wife Sarai, &amp;quot;My Princess,&amp;quot; will be her name. and I will certainly give you a son through her.

			<VERS vnumber="5">You will no longer be named Abram because I am changing your name to Abraham, and kings will trace their lineage back to you.

			<VERS vnumber="7">Yes, I will establish my eternal covenant of love between me and you,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">I will give to you and your seed</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">God explained to Abraham, &amp;apos;Your part of the covenant is to obey its terms, you and your descendants throughout the ages.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">So here is the sign of the covenant that you are to keep, so that it will endure between you and me and your descendants: circumcise every male among you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">You must undergo cutting off the flesh of your foreskin as a special sign of the covenant between me and you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Throughout your generations, each male child must be circumcised eight days after his birth. This includes those not of your descendants&amp;ndash;those born in your household and foreign-born servants whom you have purchased;</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="14">Any uncircumcised male who does not have the foreskin of his flesh cut off will be cut off from his people, for he has broken my covenant.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">God also said to Abraham:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">I will wonderfully bless her,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Then Abraham laughed so hard he fell to the ground, saying to himself, &amp;apos;How in the world can a hundred-year-old man become a father? How can my wife Sarah get pregnant at ninety?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">And then he spoke out loud: &amp;apos;O, that Ishmael might prosper with your blessing!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">God said, &amp;apos;Listen to me. I promise that you and Sarah will have a son, and you will call him Isaac. I will confirm my everlasting covenant of love with him and his seed.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="22">When he had finished speaking with Abraham, God ascended up to heaven .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">So without delay Abraham obeyed God and took his son Ishmael and every male in his household (whether born in his house or foreign-born servants) and circumcised them that very same day.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">Abraham was already ninety-nine years old when he was circumcised,</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1">Yahweh appeared once again to Abraham while he lived by the oak grove of Mamre. During the hottest part of the day, as Abraham sat at his tent door,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">he looked up and suddenly saw three men standing nearby. As soon as he saw them, he ran from his tent to welcome them. He bowed down to the ground</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">and said, &amp;apos;My Lord, if I have found favor in your sight, don&amp;quot;t pass me by. Stay for a while with your servant.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">I&amp;quot;ll have some water brought to you all so that you can wash your feet. Rest here a while under the tree.</VERS>

If I find forty-five righteous in Sodom, I will spare the whole city.&amp;apos; Yahweh answered, &amp;apos;Alright. If I only find forty, I will spare the city.&amp;apos; Yahweh answered, &amp;apos;Alright. If I find only thirty, I will spare the city.&amp;apos; Yahweh answered, &amp;apos;Alright. For the sake of the twenty I will not destroy the city.&amp;apos; And Yahweh answered, &amp;apos;Alright. I will extend my mercy and not destroy the city for the sake of ten righteous.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Abraham hurried back into the tent and said to Sarah, &amp;apos;Quick, we have guests ! Get three measures of fine flour, knead it, and bake some bread.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Then Abraham ran to the herd, selected a tender choice calf, and told his servant, &amp;apos;Hurry&amp;ndash;prepare this calf for my guests !&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Then he brought the meal they had prepared&amp;ndash;roasted meat, bread, curds, and milk&amp;ndash;and set it before his guests. Abraham stood by them under the tree while they ate.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">They asked him, &amp;apos;Where is your wife Sarah?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Then one spoke up and said, &amp;apos;I will return about this time next year, when your wife Sarah will certainly have a son.&amp;apos; Sarah overheard it, for she was at the tent door not far behind him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Now, both Abraham and Sarah were already very old, and Sarah was past the age of childbearing.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Sarah laughed to herself with disbelief , saying, &amp;apos;A woman my age&amp;ndash;have a baby? After I&amp;quot;m worn out will I now enjoy marital bliss and conceive &amp;ndash;and with my aged husband?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Yahweh knew her thoughts and asked Abraham, &amp;apos;Why is Sarah laughing, saying, &amp;quot;How can a woman my age have a baby?&amp;quot;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Do you think there is anything too marvelous for Yahweh ? I will appear to you at the appointed time next year and Sarah will have a son!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Sarah was afraid, so she denied it, saying, &amp;apos;I wasn&amp;quot;t laughing.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Afterward, the three men departed and walked toward Sodom, and Abraham went off with them to see them on their way.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">As they walked , Yahweh said, &amp;apos;Should I really hide from Abraham what I intend to do?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">After all, he will become a great and powerful nation, and every nation on earth will seek bliss like his.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">It is true; I have singled him out as my own, so that he will lead his family and household to follow my ways and live by what is right and just. I will fulfill all the promises that I have spoken to him.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Yahweh explained to Abraham , &amp;apos;The outcry for justice against Sodom and Gomorrah is so great and their sin so blatant</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">that I must go down and see if their wicked actions are as great as the outrage that has come to me, and if not, then I will know.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">As Yahweh &amp;quot;s two companions went on toward Sodom, Abraham remained there, as Yahweh paused before Abraham.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">So Abraham came forward to present his case before Yahweh , and said, &amp;apos;Are you really going to sweep away the righteous while you judge the wicked?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">What if you find fifty righteous people in Sodom? Isn&amp;quot;t your mercy great enough to forgive? Why judge the entire city at the cost of the fifty righteous who live there?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">That&amp;quot;s not who you are&amp;ndash;one who would slay the righteous with the wicked, treating them both the same way! Wouldn&amp;quot;t the Merciful Judge of all the earth always do what is right?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">And Yahweh said, &amp;apos;Alright. If I find fifty righteous in Sodom, I will spare the whole city for their sake.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">Abraham spoke up again and said, &amp;apos;I am just a man formed from earth&amp;quot;s dust and ashes but allow me to be so bold as to ask you, my Lord.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">What if there are only five lacking, and you only find forty-five righteous in Sodom? It&amp;quot;s not who you are to destroy the entire city for lack of five righteous people.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">&amp;apos;But what if there are only forty?&amp;apos; Abraham asked further.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">Abraham paused &amp;ndash;then he said, &amp;apos;Lord, please don&amp;quot;t be offended with me, and let me speak . . . What if there are only thirty?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">Abraham ventured even further, asking, &amp;apos;Allow me to dare speak this way to you, my Lord. But what if you find there only twenty righteous?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">Then Abraham took a deep breath and asked, &amp;apos;Once more, please don&amp;quot;t let my Lord be angry with me if I make but one more request. What if you find only ten righteous?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">Yahweh finished speaking with Abraham. He immediately went on his way, and Abraham returned home.</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="19">
			<VERS vnumber="1">That evening, the two angels came to Sodom while Lot was sitting at the city&amp;quot;s gateway. When Lot saw them, he got up to meet them and bowed with his face to the ground.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">He said, &amp;apos;Please, my lords, come to your servant&amp;quot;s house to spend the night and wash your feet; then you can rise early and go on your way.&amp;apos; &amp;apos;No,&amp;apos; they answered. &amp;apos;We will be fine to spend the night in the town square.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">But Lot was so insistent they finally agreed to go to his house. Lot had unleavened bread baked for them and prepared a feast, and they ate.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">But before they retired for the night, the men of the city, men young and old, from every part of the city of Sodom, to the last man, surrounded the house.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">They shouted out to Lot, &amp;apos;Where are the men who came to your house tonight? Bring them out to us so that we can have sex with them!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Lot went outside, shutting the door behind him,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">and said to them, &amp;apos;No! My brothers, I beg you , don&amp;quot;t sink to such depravity!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Look, I have two virgin daughters; I&amp;quot;ll bring them out to you, and you can do with them as you please. Only don&amp;quot;t do anything to these men, for they are guests in my house.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">&amp;apos;Get out of our way,&amp;apos; they replied. &amp;apos;This guy comes as a foreigner to live among us, and now he dares to judge us! We&amp;quot;ll inflict more harm on you than on them!&amp;apos; Just then they lunged at Lot and tried to break down the door,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">but the two angels reached out and pulled Lot safely back into the house and bolted the door.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">They struck the men outside the house, young and old, with one blazing flash of light so that they could not find the door!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Then the visitors said to Lot, &amp;apos;Who else lives here? Do you have any other family here&amp;ndash;sons or daughters, sons-in-law or daughters-in-law who live in Sodom? Get them all out of the city,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">because we are about to destroy this place. A tremendous outcry against the people has come before Yahweh , and he has sent us here to destroy it!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">So Lot went out to find the two men who were pledged to marry his daughters and told them, &amp;apos;Hurry, leave the city, for Yahweh is about to destroy it!&amp;apos; But they thought he was only joking and paid him no attention .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">At dawn, the angels urged Lot, saying, &amp;apos;Go! Take your wife and your two daughters and leave or you will be consumed in the judgment about to come to the city!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">But Lot hesitated, so the angels grabbed his hands and the hands of his wife and daughters and brought them outside the city, because Yahweh was merciful to them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Once they were safely outside the city, the angels said to them, &amp;apos;Run for your lives! Don&amp;quot;t stop anywhere in the plain until you&amp;quot;ve reached the mountains. And don&amp;quot;t even look back, or you&amp;quot;ll die!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Lot replied, &amp;apos;Oh no, my lords.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">You&amp;quot;ve been so gracious to your servant, and you&amp;quot;ve been so kind to save our lives, but I can&amp;quot;t make it to the mountains. It&amp;quot;s so far from here; disaster will overtake me, and I&amp;quot;ll die!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Look, over there is a village close enough to run to, and it&amp;quot;s a small one. Let me escape there instead. You can see that it&amp;quot;s such a small village. Let my life be spared!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">&amp;apos;All right,&amp;apos; he replied. &amp;apos;I will grant this request too. I will not destroy that village.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Now, you must hurry. Run to that village, for I can&amp;quot;t do anything until you are there.&amp;apos; (That is why the village was called Zoar.)</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">By mid-morning, Lot arrived at the small village of Zoar,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">And Yahweh &amp;quot;s fire from heaven fell upon Sodom and Gomorrah.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">He completely destroyed the cities of the plain, and all their inhabitants and whatever grew in the valley.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">But Lot&amp;quot;s wife turned and gazed longingly on the city and turned into a pillar of salt.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">That morning, Abraham hurried back to the place where he had stood before Yahweh .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">Looking down toward all the land of the plain, he saw columns of smoke billowing up from Sodom and Gomorrah &amp;ndash;like the smoke of a furnace!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">So before God destroyed the cities of the plain where Lot had settled, he remembered his affection for Abraham and spared Lot from all the destruction.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">Afraid to remain in Zoar, Lot left there and settled in the hill country and lived in a cave with his two daughters.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">One day , his firstborn suggested to the younger, &amp;apos;Our father is getting old, and there isn&amp;quot;t a man anywhere who could impregnate us in the normal way.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">Come, let&amp;quot;s get our father drunk with wine and have sex with him. That way we can at least have children through our father.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">That night, they got their father drunk with wine, and the firstborn went in and slept with him. Lot was so drunk he didn&amp;quot;t have a clue about what had happened.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">The next day, the firstborn said to the younger, &amp;apos;I slept with my father last night. Tonight, it&amp;quot;s your turn. We&amp;quot;ll get him drunk with wine, and you can sleep with him and we can preserve our family line through our father.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">So they got their father drunk the second time; and the younger went in and slept with him. He was once again so drunk he had no clue what had happened.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">As a result, both Lot&amp;quot;s daughters became pregnant by their father.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">The older daughter had a son named Moab, who is the ancestor of the Moabites of today.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">The younger also had a son named Ben-Ammi, the ancestor of the Ammonites of today.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="20">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Abraham journeyed from the oaks of Mamre to the southern region of Canaan and settled between Kadesh and Shur, to live as a temporary resident in Gerar.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Now Abraham had said about his wife Sarah, &amp;apos;She&amp;quot;s my sister.&amp;apos; So Abimelech, king of Gerar, sent for her and took her into his harem .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">One night, God appeared to Abimelech in a dream and said to him, &amp;apos;You&amp;quot;re as good as dead, for you have taken into your harem a married woman!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Now Abimelech had not touched Sarah, so he said to the Lord, &amp;apos;Would you really destroy people who are innocent?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Didn&amp;quot;t the man tell me, &amp;quot;She is my sister&amp;quot;? And didn&amp;quot;t she agree and say, &amp;quot;Yes, he&amp;quot;s my brother&amp;quot;? I&amp;quot;ve done this with clean hands and a clear conscience.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Then God answered him in the dream, &amp;apos;Yes, I know you did this with a clear conscience. Furthermore, it was I who kept you from sinning and kept you from touching her.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Now return the man&amp;quot;s wife, and because he is a prophet, he will intercede on your behalf that you may live. But if you don&amp;quot;t give her back&amp;ndash;you will certainly die, you and your entire household.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">So Abimelech rose early in the morning and gathered all his servants. When he told them about his dream, they were terrified!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Abimelech summoned Abraham and asked him, &amp;apos;What is this trick you have played on us? I did nothing wrong to you. Why would you bring such great guilt upon me and my kingdom? You have done to me what no one should ever do to another.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Then Abimelech asked, &amp;apos;What is your purpose in doing this?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Abraham answered, &amp;apos;Because I thought, &amp;quot;There&amp;quot;s no one here that fears God. They will kill me to get to my wife.&amp;quot;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Besides, she really is my half sister. She&amp;quot;s my father&amp;quot;s daughter, but not my mother&amp;quot;s, so I married her.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">When God sent me out to wander from my father&amp;quot;s house, I said to her, &amp;quot;Here is how you can show your love for me. Everywhere we go, you must say about me, &amp;apos;He&amp;quot;s my brother.&amp;apos; &amp;quot; &amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Then Abimelech gave Abraham&amp;quot;s wife Sarah back to him. In addition, he gave him sheep, cattle, and both male and female servants.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Abimelech told him, &amp;apos;Look, my land is now before you; feel free to settle wherever you please.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Then he turned to Sarah and said, &amp;apos;I am giving your brother a thousand pieces of silver as compensation to settle any claim against me, to exonerate you in the eyes of all who are with you, and to clear your reputation.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Then Abraham prayed to God; and God healed Abimelech! He also healed Abimelech&amp;quot;s wife and female servants of their infertility and they began to have babies again.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">For Yahweh had shut all the wombs of the women of Abimelech&amp;quot;s household because he took Sarah, Abraham&amp;quot;s wife.</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="21">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Yahweh visited Sarah, just as he said he would, and fulfilled his promise to her.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">And Sarah conceived and bore Abraham a son in his old age, at the exact time God had promised them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Abraham named his son Isaac, the miracle son, whom Sarah bore him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">When Isaac was eight days old, Abraham circumcised him, as God had commanded him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Abraham was one hundred years old when his son Isaac was born.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Sarah said, &amp;apos;God has brought me laughter, and everyone who hears about this will laugh with me.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">And she added, &amp;apos;Who would ever have told Abraham that Sarah would one day nurse children! Even though Abraham is an old man, look&amp;ndash;I have given him a son!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Isaac grew and was weaned; and on the day Sarah weaned him, Abraham prepared a great feast.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">But Sarah noticed the son of Hagar, the Egyptian, was mocking her son Isaac .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">So she said to Abraham, &amp;apos;Get rid of this slave woman and her son. Banish them, for the son of that slave woman must not become a coheir with my son Isaac!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Abraham was very upset over Sarah&amp;quot;s demand, for Ishmael was his son too.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">God spoke to Abraham, &amp;apos;Don&amp;quot;t be distressed over the slave woman and her son. Listen to every word Sarah says to you, and do it, for it will be through Isaac your promise of descendants will be fulfilled.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Rest assured, I will make the son of your slave woman into a nation too, because he is your son.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Abraham rose up early the next morning, bundled up some food and a skin of water, and strapped them to Hagar&amp;quot;s shoulders. Then he gave her his son and sent them away. So, Hagar and her son Ishmael departed and wandered off into the wilderness of Beersheba.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">When the water was gone, she grew desperate, so she left her son under a bush.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Then she walked about the distance of a bowshot and sat down, for she thought, &amp;apos;I can&amp;quot;t bear to watch my son die.&amp;apos; As she sat nearby, she broke into tears and sobbed uncontrollably.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">And God heard the voice of the boy. The angel of God called out to Hagar from the heavenly realm and said, &amp;apos;What&amp;quot;s the matter, Hagar? Don&amp;quot;t be afraid, for God has heard the voice of your son crying as he lies there.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Get up! Help the boy up and hold him by the hand, for I will make him into a great nation.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Then God opened her eyes to reveal a well of water. She went over to the well and filled the skin with water and gave the boy a long, cool drink.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">God was with Ishmael as he grew up in the wilderness of Paran. He became an expert archer,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">and his mother, Hagar, arranged a marriage for him with an Egyptian woman.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">At that time, King Abimelech and Phicol, his army commander, came to Abraham and said, &amp;apos; It is obvious that God is with you and blesses everything you do.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">Now swear to me here before God that you will not deceive me, my children, or my descendants, but as I have shown you loyal friendship, so you will treat me&amp;ndash;and the land in which you live as a foreigner&amp;ndash;with loyal friendship.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">&amp;apos;I give you my oath,&amp;apos; Abraham answered.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">But Abraham voiced a complaint about a well of water which Abimelech&amp;quot;s servants had seized by force.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">Abimelech responded, &amp;apos;This is the first time I&amp;quot;ve heard about this; you never told me before now. I don&amp;quot;t know who has done this.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">So Abraham took sheep and cattle, gave them to Abimelech, and the two men made a covenant.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">Then Abraham set apart from his flock seven ewe lambs,</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="30">He replied, &amp;apos; I am giving them to you , and by accepting these seven ewe lambs, you acknowledge the proof that I dug this well and it belongs to me .&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">That place was called Beersheba, because it was there that both men swore an oath to one another.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">After completing their pact at Beersheba, King Abimelech and Phicol, his army commander, departed and returned to Philistine country.</VERS>

He said, &amp;apos;Abraham!&amp;apos; and did not withhold from me your son&amp;ndash;your beloved son &amp;ndash; Your offspring will take possession of the city gates of their enemies. the entire world will be blessed through your seed.&amp;quot; &amp;apos; &amp;apos;Yes, I&amp;quot;m here,&amp;apos; Abraham answered. &amp;apos;Yes, my son,&amp;apos; Abraham replied. &amp;apos;We have the wood and the fire,&amp;apos; Isaac said, &amp;apos;but where is the lamb for the burnt offering?&amp;apos; &amp;apos;Yes, I&amp;quot;m here,&amp;apos; he answered. by the glory of my own name,&amp;quot; decrees Yahweh , &amp;quot;because you have obeyed my voice I will greatly bless you! I will make sure your seed becomes as numerous as the stars of heaven and as the sand of the seashore.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">God said, &amp;apos;Please take your son, your only son, Isaac, whom I know you dearly love, and go to the land of Moriah. Offer him up to me as a burnt offering on one of the mountains which I will show you.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Early the next morning, Abraham cut the wood for the burnt offering, loaded it on his donkey, and set out for the distant place God had shown him. He took with him two of his servants, and his son Isaac.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">On the third day, Abraham looked up and saw the place in the distance.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">&amp;apos;Stay here with the donkey,&amp;apos; Abraham told the young men. &amp;apos;Isaac and I will go up and worship; then we will return to you.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">So Abraham took the wood for the burnt offering and placed it on Isaac&amp;quot;s back. Abraham carried the knife and the fire, and the two of them walked up the mountain together.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">&amp;apos;Father?&amp;apos; Isaac broke the silence.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Abraham answered, &amp;apos;My son, God himself will provide the lamb for an offering.&amp;apos; So they went on together.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">When they arrived at the place on Mount Moriah that God had shown him, Abraham built an altar and stacked the wood on it. He tied up his son Isaac and laid him on top of the wood on the altar.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Then Abraham took the knife in his hand to plunge it into his son,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">but the angel of Yahweh called to him from heaven, saying, &amp;apos;Abraham! Abraham!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">&amp;apos;Do not lay a hand on the boy or harm him,&amp;apos; he said, &amp;apos;for now, I know you are fully dedicated to me, since you did not withhold your son, your beloved son, from me.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">As Abraham looked up, his eyes fell upon a ram caught by its horns in a nearby thicket. Abraham took the ram and sacrificed it on the altar as a burnt offering in Isaac&amp;quot;s place.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">So Abraham named that place Yahweh Appears. Even to this day, it is said, &amp;apos;On Yahweh &amp;quot;s Mountain there is vision.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Yahweh &amp;quot;s angel spoke a second time from heaven:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Because you have obeyed me,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">So Abraham and Isaac returned to the waiting servants, and they departed for Beersheba, where Abraham had settled.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">Moreover, Nahor had another wife, Reumah, who also had four sons: Tebah, Gaham, Tahash, and Maacah.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="23">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Sarah lived to be one hundred and twenty-seven.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">She died in the land of Canaan at Kiriath Arba, now known as Hebron. There Abraham mourned and wept for her.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">After his time of mourning was over , Abraham got up from where her body lay, and went to speak with the Hittites. He said to them,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">&amp;apos;I live as an alien and stranger among you. Sell me some of your property so I can use it as a burial site for my wife .&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Then Abraham bowed respectfully before the Hittites, the people of the land</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">and he said to them, &amp;apos;If you are willing to allow my wife a proper burial, then please hear me out. On my behalf please persuade your countryman , Ephron the son of Zohar,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">to sell me the cave he owns at Machpelah on the edge of his land. Let him sell it to me publicly and at the full price, so that I may own it for a burial site.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Now Ephron the Hittite was sitting there among his countrymen. He spoke up so all the Hittites who sat at the gate as elders of the city could hear him, and said,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">&amp;apos;No, my lord, listen. I will give you not only the cave but also the entire field! In the presence of my people, I will give it to you to bury your dead.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Then Abraham bowed low before the people of the land,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">and he said to Ephron in the hearing of all the people, &amp;apos;No, please listen, kind sir . I will pay whatever the field is worth. Take my money so that I can bury my dead there.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">So Abraham agreed to the amount, weighed out the four hundred silver shekels according to the merchant&amp;quot;s standard of weight, and in the presence of the Hittites he gave the money to Ephron.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">So Ephron&amp;quot;s field of Machpelah, east of Mamre, along with the cave and all the trees within its borders, passed</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">to Abraham as his legal possession. The complete transaction was carried out in the presence of the Hittites&amp;ndash;those who sat as elders at the city gates.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">After this, Abraham buried his wife Sarah in the cave there in the field of Machpelah near Mamre (now Hebron) in the land of Canaan.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Both the field and the cave passed from the Hittites to Abraham&amp;quot;s possession to be his family burial ground.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="24">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Now, Yahweh had wonderfully blessed Abraham in every way, and he became a very old man, well advanced in years.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">One day, Abraham called for his trusted head servant, who was in charge of all that he had, and said &amp;apos;Please, put your hand here under my thigh,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">and I will make you swear by Yahweh , the God of heaven and earth, that you will not acquire a wife for my son among the daughters of the Canaanites among whom I am living.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Promise me you will go instead to my relatives in my native land and find a wife among them for my son Isaac.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">The servant asked him, &amp;apos;Suppose the woman is not willing to come back with me to this land. Should I then take your son back to your native land?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">&amp;apos;Absolutely not,&amp;apos; Abraham answered, &amp;apos;make sure that you do not take my son back there.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">For Yahweh , the God of heaven, took me from my father&amp;quot;s house and from the land of my birth. He spoke to me and solemnly promised that he would give this land to my descendants. I know he will send his angel before you so that you can find a wife for my son from there.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">And if for any reason the woman is unwilling to come back with you, then you are released from this oath that you swear to me. But no matter what , do not take my son back there!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">So, the servant put his hand under the thigh of his master Abraham and swore an oath to carry out his wishes.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">So the servant took ten of his master&amp;quot;s camels, loaded them with all sorts of gifts, some of the best things his master owned, and journeyed toward the distant land of Mesopotamia until he got to the village where Abraham&amp;quot;s brother Nahor had lived .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">He had his camels kneel by a well outside the village. It was evening, the time when the women came out to draw water.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">He prayed: &amp;apos; Yahweh , God of my master Abraham, let my journey here be a success and show your gracious love to my master Abraham.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">I am standing here by this well, and the young women of the village are coming out to draw water. Give me a sign .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">I will say to one of the girls, &amp;quot;Please, lower your jar and give me a drink.&amp;quot; And if she is the right one, the girl whom you have chosen to be a wife for your servant Isaac, then let her say to me, &amp;quot;Drink, and I will also draw water for your camels.&amp;quot; By this sign I will know that you have shown your gracious love to my master.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Suddenly, before he had finished praying, there was Rebekah approaching the well with her jar on her shoulder. She was the daughter of Bethuel and the granddaughter of Milcah and Abraham&amp;quot;s brother Nahor.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">The young woman was strikingly beautiful, unmarried, and still a virgin. She walked down to the well, filled her jar, and came back up.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Abraham&amp;quot;s servant hurried over to meet her and said, &amp;apos;Please, lower your jar and give me a little drink.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">She responded, &amp;apos;Drink, my lord.&amp;apos; She then quickly lowered her jar to give him a drink.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Then, after she had finished giving him a drink, she added, &amp;apos;I will also draw water for your camels until they have finished drinking.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">She quickly emptied her jar into the watering trough and ran back to the well to draw more water, until she had watered all the camels.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Meanwhile, the servant stared at her, silently pondering whether Yahweh had indeed made his journey successful.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">After the camels had finished drinking, he took a costly gold nose ring weighing a half shekel and two solid gold bracelets weighing ten shekels, and gave them to Rebekah.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">Then he asked her, &amp;apos;Tell me, who is your father? Is there room in your father&amp;quot;s house for me and my men to stay tonight?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">She replied, &amp;apos;My father&amp;quot;s name is Bethuel, and my grandparents are Milcah and Nahor.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">She went on, &amp;apos;There is room for you to spend the night at our home, and plenty of straw and food for the camels.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">Upon hearing this, the servant bowed down and worshiped Yahweh ,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">saying, &amp;apos;Praised be Yahweh , the God of Abraham, for you have faithfully kept your promise to my master and displayed your wonderful kindness and love. Yahweh , you led me straight to the very place of my master&amp;quot;s relatives!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">Then the girl quickly ran to inform her mother and family about all that had happened.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">Then Laban said to the man, &amp;apos;Friend, Yahweh has wonderfully blessed you; please, come to my home. Why are you standing out here when I have prepared the house for you and a place for your camels?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">So the man came into the house, and his camels were unloaded and given straw and feed. The servants brought water to wash the man&amp;quot;s feet and the feet of the men with him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">But when they set food before him, he said, &amp;apos;I won&amp;quot;t eat until I tell you why I&amp;quot;m here.&amp;apos; &amp;apos;Please, tell us,&amp;apos; Laban said. First thing in the morning, he said to them, &amp;apos;Allow me now to return to my master.&amp;apos; &amp;apos;I will gladly go with him,&amp;apos; she answered. &amp;apos;Our dear sister, May your descendants gain possession &amp;apos;Why, he&amp;quot;s the one about whom I told you , that&amp;quot;s my young master!&amp;apos; the servant said. So Rebekah quickly took her veil and covered her face.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">&amp;apos;I am Abraham&amp;quot;s servant,&amp;apos; he began.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">&amp;apos; Yahweh has wonderfully blessed my master, and he has become extremely wealthy. Yahweh has given him flocks and herds, camels and donkeys, a fortune in silver and gold, and many male and female servants.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">And my master&amp;quot;s wife, Sarah, has miraculously borne him a son in her old age, and my master&amp;quot;s son is the sole heir of his fortune.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">My master has put me under an oath saying, &amp;quot;Do not get a wife for my son from among the daughters of the Canaanites among whom I am living.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">Instead, go to my relatives in my native land and find a wife among them for my son.&amp;quot;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">In reply I said to my master, &amp;quot;Suppose the woman refuses to return with me.&amp;quot;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">He answered me, &amp;quot; Yahweh , in whose presence I have walked all these years , will send his angel with you and will make your mission successful. You will find a wife for my son from among my relatives, my father&amp;quot;s family.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">If you go to my relatives, and they will not give her to you, then and only then will you be released from this oath.&amp;quot;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">So, when I arrived at the well today, I prayed, &amp;quot;O Yahweh , God of my master Abraham, make my mission a success.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43">I&amp;quot;m here standing at this well. May the right girl for my master&amp;quot;s son come out to draw water. And when she does, I will say to her &amp;apos;Please give me a little drink from your jar.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44">And if she replies, saying, &amp;apos;Drink, and I will also draw water for your camels,&amp;apos; then I might know that she is the young woman Yahweh has chosen for my master&amp;quot;s son.&amp;quot;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45">&amp;apos;Before I had even finished my heartfelt prayer, there was Rebekah coming out with her water jar on her shoulder! After she went down to the well and filled her jar, I said to her, &amp;quot;Please give me a drink.&amp;quot;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46">She quickly lowered her jar and said, &amp;quot;Drink, and I will also draw water for your camels.&amp;quot; So, I drank, and she also watered the camels.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="47">Then I asked her, &amp;quot;Tell me, who is your father?&amp;quot; She said, &amp;quot;I&amp;quot;m the daughter of Bethuel, son of Nahor, whom Milcah bore to him.&amp;quot; When I learned she was of my master&amp;quot;s family , I put a gold ring in her nose and gold bracelets on her wrists,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="48">and I bowed before Yahweh and worshiped him. I praised Yahweh , the God of my master Abraham, who led me perfectly on the right path to find the very daughter of my master&amp;quot;s brother to marry his son.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="49">Now, if you will show faithful love to my master and do what is right, then give me permission to take Rebekah back to his land . If not, tell me, and I will go on my way.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="50">After hearing this , Laban and Bethuel said, &amp;apos;This was all planned by Yahweh ! If this is his plan, what can we say?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="51">Here stands our Rebekah before you. You may take her and go and let her marry your master&amp;quot;s son and fulfill Yahweh &amp;quot;s plan for her.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="52">When Abraham&amp;quot;s servant heard their words, he bowed his face down to the ground and worshiped Yahweh .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="53">Then he brought expensive jewelry of silver and gold and exquisitely embroidered garments, and gave them all to Rebekah, and he gave costly gifts to her brother and her mother.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="54">Afterward, the servant and his men ate and drank, and they spent the night in Laban&amp;quot;s home .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="55">Her brother and mother replied, &amp;apos;Please let Rebekah remain with us a while&amp;ndash;for ten days or so, then she may go with you.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="56">He responded, &amp;apos;Please, Yahweh has made my mission successful. Send me off with her to my master, don&amp;quot;t make me wait.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="57">They answered him, &amp;apos;We will call for Rebekah and see what she wants to do.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="58">So they called for Rebekah and asked her, &amp;apos;Will you go with this man?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="59">So they sent their sister Rebekah away with her servant girls to go with Abraham&amp;quot;s servant and his men.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="60">As she departed , they blessed her with these words: may you become thousands of ten thousands! of the city gates of their foes!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="61">Then Rebekah and her servant girls mounted the camels and followed the servant and his men.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="62">Meanwhile, Isaac, who was living in the southern desert of Canaan, had just come back to his camp from the Well of the Living One Who Watches Over Me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="63">Isaac went out in the evening into the field to meditate. He looked up, and saw camels coming in the distance .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="64">As Rebekah got closer, she raised her eyes, and when she saw Isaac, she nearly fell off her camel!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="65">She whispered to the servant, &amp;apos;Who is that man walking in the field toward us?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="66">Then the servant began to explain to Isaac in detail all the amazing things that had happened.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="67">Isaac fell in love with Rebekah. He took her to be his wife, and they were married, and he brought her into his mother Sarah&amp;quot;s tent. In this way, Isaac was greatly comforted after his mother&amp;quot;s death.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="25">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Now Abraham had taken another wife, whose name was Keturah.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">She and Abraham had sons named Zimran, Jokshan, Medan, Midian, Ishbak, and Shuah.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Jokshan was the father of Sheba and Dedan.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Dedan&amp;quot;s sons were the Ashurites, the Letushites, and the Leummites. Midian&amp;quot;s sons were Ephah, Epher, Hanoch, Abida, and Eldaah. All these were the descendants of Keturah.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Abraham gave all that he possessed to Isaac,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">but to his sons by his concubines he gave gifts while he was still living. He sent them all away eastward, separating them from his son Isaac.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Abraham lived a total of one hundred and seventy-five years.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Abraham took his final breath, dying at a good old age. After having lived a full, content life, he joined his ancestors.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">His sons, Isaac and Ishmael, buried him in the cave of Machpelah, in the field which had belonged to Ephron, the son of Zohar the Hittite, east of Mamre.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">They buried him next to his wife Sarah, in the same field that Abraham purchased from the Hittites.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">After Abraham had passed, God greatly blessed his son Isaac, and Isaac settled near the well named the Well of the Living One Who Watches Over Me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">This is the account of the descendants of Abraham&amp;quot;s son Ishmael, whom Sarah&amp;quot;s servant, Hagar the Egyptian, bore to Abraham.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">The names of Ishmael&amp;quot;s sons in their birth order are: Nebaioth the firstborn; and Kedar, Adbeel, Mibsam,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Mishma, Dumah, Massa,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Hadad, Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">These twelve sons of Ishmael became princes of twelve tribes that were named after them, listed by the places they settled and camped.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">This is how the story of Isaac begins. He was the beloved son of Abraham and the successor of Abraham&amp;quot;s blessing .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">When he was forty, he married Rebekah. She was the daughter of Bethuel and the sister of Laban. Both her father and brother were Arameans from Paddan-Aram.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Now, Rebekah was unable to have children, but Isaac pleaded with Yahweh on behalf of his wife because she was barren&amp;ndash;and she did get pregnant, for Yahweh responded to Isaac&amp;quot;s prayer.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">During her pregnancy , Rebekah could feel twins thrashing and struggling with each other inside her womb. So she went to inquire of Yahweh , saying, &amp;apos;Why do I have to live with this?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">And Yahweh answered her, saying, &amp;apos;The two sons in your womb will become two nations, One people will become stronger than the other, and the older will serve the younger.&amp;apos; and the two peoples within you will become rivals.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">And when the time came for Rebekah to give birth, sure enough, she had twins!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">The first one came out reddish and covered with hair like a hairy garment; so they named him Esau.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">And his brother came out with his hand grasping Esau&amp;quot;s heel; so, they named him Jacob. Isaac was sixty when the twins were born.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">When the boys grew up, Esau became a rugged outdoorsman and a hardy hunter, but Jacob was more contemplative, content to stay close to home.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">Isaac loved Esau because he was fond of eating wild game, but Rebekah dearly loved Jacob.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">One day, when Jacob was cooking a stew, Esau returned from hunting, and he was famished.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">Smelling the aroma of food , Esau said to Jacob, &amp;apos;I&amp;quot;m starving! Let me eat some of that red stuff you&amp;quot;re cooking.&amp;apos; (This is why he is also called Edom.)</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">&amp;apos;Yes, but first you must trade me your birthright,&amp;apos; Jacob replied.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">&amp;apos;Can&amp;quot;t you see I&amp;quot;m dying of hunger?&amp;apos; Esau said. &amp;apos;What good is the birthright if I&amp;quot;m dead?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">But Jacob insisted, &amp;apos;First, swear to me that you&amp;quot;ll give it to me.&amp;apos; So, Esau swore an oath and surrendered his birthright to Jacob.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">Then Jacob gave Esau some lentil stew and bread. When Esau had finished eating and drinking, he just got up and walked away. Esau cared nothing about his own birthright.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="26">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Now, another famine struck the land, like the one in Abraham&amp;quot;s time. Isaac traveled to Gerar where Abimelech was the Philistine king.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Yahweh appeared before Isaac and said, &amp;apos;Do not go down to Egypt. Stay in the land that I will reveal to you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Live there as a foreigner, and my presence will be with you. I promise to bless you, for I will give all these lands to you and your descendants. I will fulfill the oath I swore to your father Abraham.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">I will make your descendants as numerous as the stars of heaven, and I will one day give them all these lands. I will bless all the nations of the earth through your offspring</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">because Abraham was faithful to me. He listened to my voice and yielded his heart to follow my direction. He kept my commandments, my instructions, and my teachings.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">So Isaac settled in Gerar.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">The men of the land noticed Rebekah&amp;quot;s beauty and asked Isaac about her. &amp;apos;Oh, she&amp;quot;s just my sister,&amp;apos; he replied. Rebekah was indeed very beautiful, and he was afraid to tell them, &amp;apos;She&amp;quot;s my wife,&amp;apos; for he thought that the men of the land would kill him and take his wife.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">One day, after Isaac had lived there awhile, the Philistine king Abimelech looked out his window and saw Isaac affectionately caressing his wife Rebekah.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">So Abimelech summoned Isaac and said, &amp;apos;So, this woman is your wife! Why did you say that she was your sister?&amp;apos; &amp;apos;Because I thought the men of the land would kill me and take her ,&amp;apos; Isaac said. &amp;apos;I am the God of Abraham your father. You will never need to fear a thing for I am with you and I will greatly bless you. Your children will flourish and succeed because of the promises I gave my servant Abraham.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">&amp;apos;Don&amp;quot;t you realize what you&amp;quot;ve done to us?&amp;apos; Abimelech asked. &amp;apos;One of our men might have slept with your wife, and you would have brought guilt and punishment upon us!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">So Abimelech issued a stern warning to all the people, saying, &amp;apos;Whoever lays a hand on this man or his wife shall be put to death!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Isaac planted crops in that land, and in the same year reaped a hundred-fold harvest, for Yahweh greatly blessed him!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Isaac grew richer and richer until he was extremely wealthy.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">He acquired so many flocks and herds and so many servants that the Philistines grew jealous,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">so the Philistines stopped up all of Isaac&amp;quot;s wells and filled them with dirt&amp;ndash;the same wells his father&amp;quot;s servants had dug in the time of Abraham.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Eventually Abimelech&amp;quot;s jealousy got the better of him , and he said to Isaac, &amp;apos;You must leave us! You have become too rich and powerful for us!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">So Isaac departed from Abimelech&amp;quot;s domain and camped near the Wadi of Gerar, where he settled.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Isaac reopened and restored the wells his father Abraham had originally dug&amp;ndash;the wells the Philistines had stopped up after Abraham&amp;quot;s death. And Isaac gave these wells the same names that his father had given them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">One day, when Isaac&amp;quot;s servants dug in the valley, they uncovered a spring-fed well.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">But the herdsmen of Gerar picked a fight with Isaac&amp;quot;s herdsmen, saying, &amp;apos;That&amp;quot;s our well!&amp;apos; So Isaac named the well Argument because of the sharp contention.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">They dug a second well, and it also caused a quarrel, so Isaac named that well Hostility.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Then he pulled up stakes from there and dug a third well, but this one was dug without any quarreling, so Isaac named it Spacious, saying, &amp;apos;Finally, Yahweh has made ample room for us and we will become prosperous in the land!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">From there, Isaac moved his camp to Beersheba.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">That very night, Yahweh appeared before him and said:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">So Isaac built an altar, prayed, and worshiped Yahweh there. He pitched his tent there, and his servants started digging another well.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">Then King Abimelech came to Isaac from Gerar with his adviser Ahuzzath and his army commander Phicol.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">Isaac asked them, &amp;apos;Why have you come to me now, since you hated me and sent me away?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">They answered, &amp;apos;We have witnessed firsthand how powerfully Yahweh &amp;quot;s favor has been with you, so we say, let there be a peace treaty among us. Let us make a covenant</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">to do each other no harm. Swear to us that you will not trouble us, just as we have not troubled you and have always treated you well and sent you away in peace. Now look at how Yahweh has blessed you!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">So Isaac prepared a wonderful feast for them, and they all ate and drank together.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">Then the next morning, they got up early and exchanged oaths. Isaac said goodbye to them, and they left Isaac in peace.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">Later that same day, Isaac&amp;quot;s servants came with wonderful news about the well they had dug, saying, &amp;apos;We&amp;quot;ve just found water!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">So he named it Oath. This is why the city where they dug the well is called Beersheba to this day.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">When Esau was forty, he married two Hittite women, Judith the daughter of Beeri and Basemath the daughter of Elon.</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="27">
			<VERS vnumber="1">When Isaac was very old and blind, he called for his oldest son, Esau, and asked him, &amp;apos;My son?&amp;apos; &amp;apos; I am here, father ,&amp;apos; Esau answered. &amp;apos;Father?&amp;apos; Jacob said. Isaac replied, &amp;apos;Which one of my sons are you?&amp;apos; &amp;apos; Yahweh , your God, caused it to come right to me,&amp;apos; he replied. Jacob answered, &amp;apos;I am.&amp;apos; &amp;apos;Ah, the smell of my son is like the smell of a lush field that Yahweh has blessed! and an abundance of grain and new wine! and nations bow down to you! and may your mother&amp;quot;s sons bow down to you! Those who curse you will be cursed &amp;apos;I&amp;quot;m Esau, your firstborn son,&amp;apos; he answered. &amp;apos;You will live far from earth&amp;quot;s bounty and far from heaven&amp;quot;s dew on high. but when you grow restless,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">&amp;apos;As you can see, I am now an old man,&amp;apos; Isaac said. &amp;apos;And I may die any day now.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">So please take your hunting gear&amp;ndash;your bow and arrows&amp;ndash;and go out into the field and hunt some wild game for me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Then prepare me a savory meal, the food I love, and bring it to me. After I eat it, I will bless you from my innermost being before I die.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Now, Rebekah was eavesdropping on their conversation. So, when Esau left for the field to hunt for game to cook for Isaac,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">she found Jacob and said to him, &amp;apos;I just overheard your father say to your brother Esau,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">&amp;quot;Bring me some wild game and prepare a savory meal for me. Afterward I will bless you in the presence of Yahweh before I die.&amp;quot;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Listen carefully, my son, and do everything I tell you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Go out to the flock and bring me two of the best young goats. I&amp;quot;ll cook them for your father and prepare a delicious meal, the way he loves it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Then, you take it to him to eat and your father will bless you before he dies.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Jacob objected, &amp;apos;But my brother Esau is covered with hair, and I&amp;quot;m smooth skinned.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">If my father feels my hairless skin, he&amp;quot;ll know I&amp;quot;m not Esau . He&amp;quot;ll think I&amp;quot;m a trickster, and I&amp;quot;ll end up bringing a curse upon myself rather than a blessing!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">&amp;apos;My son,&amp;apos; his mother said, &amp;apos;let any curse against you fall on me alone! Just do what I say and go and get the goats for me.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">So he went and got the goats and brought them to his mother. She prepared a delicious meal, just the way his father loved it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Then Rebekah picked out the best clothes of her older son Esau and put them on her younger son Jacob.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">She covered Jacob&amp;quot;s hands and the soft part of his neck with goatskins.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Then she handed Jacob the tasty dish and the bread that she had prepared</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">and he took them to Isaac.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Jacob answered, &amp;apos;It&amp;quot;s I&amp;ndash;Esau&amp;ndash;your firstborn. I have done as you asked. Please, sit up. Eat some of this delicious game you love so that you may give me your innermost blessing.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Isaac asked his son, &amp;apos;How in the world did you find game so quickly, my son?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Then Isaac said to Jacob, &amp;apos;Please, please, come closer that I may touch you, my son. I need to really know for certain that you are Esau.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">So Jacob inched closer to his father Isaac, who felt his skin and said, &amp;apos;You sound like Jacob, but your hands are Esau&amp;quot;s.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">Because his hands were hairy like his brother Esau&amp;quot;s, Isaac was tricked and did not recognize that it was really Jacob. As he was about to give him his blessing,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">Isaac asked him again, &amp;apos;Are you really my son Esau?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">&amp;apos;Then bring the food to me,&amp;apos; Isaac said, &amp;apos;and let me eat my son&amp;quot;s game. Then I will give you my blessing.&amp;apos; So, Jacob gave his father the food and he ate it. He brought him wine and he drank it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">Then Isaac said to him, &amp;apos;My son, come near and kiss me.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">So he came near and kissed him. Isaac recognized the smell of his son&amp;quot;s clothes and blessed him, saying,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">May God give you heaven&amp;quot;s dew, the fatness of earth, May you be master over your brothers and those who bless you will be blessed!&amp;apos; you will break free from his control.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">Let peoples serve you</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">No sooner had Jacob left from receiving the blessing of his father Isaac, than his brother Esau arrived home from hunting.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">He too prepared a savory meal for his father and took it to him. He said to Isaac, &amp;apos;Sit up my father; eat some of your son&amp;quot;s wild game so that you can give me your innermost blessing.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">His father Isaac asked him, &amp;apos;Who are you?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">When Isaac realized what had happened , he began to tremble and shake violently. He asked, &amp;apos;Who was it then that hunted wild game and brought it to me? I&amp;quot;ve already eaten it all before you came, and I gave him the blessing&amp;ndash;yes, and he will be blessed indeed!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">When Esau heard his father&amp;quot;s words, he burst into bitter weeping and uncontrollable sobbing. He said to his father, &amp;apos; Bless me! Bless me too, father!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">Isaac answered, &amp;apos;Your brother was here and deceived me. He has taken away your blessing.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">Esau exclaimed, &amp;apos;Jacob, that heel grabber &amp;ndash;the name fits him perfectly! Now he has tricked me twice! He stole my birthright, and now he&amp;quot;s robbed me of my blessing!&amp;apos; Then he asked, &amp;apos; Father , haven&amp;quot;t you reserved a blessing for me?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">Isaac replied, &amp;apos; You don&amp;quot;t understand . My blessing will empower him to be master over you. I have already given him all his brothers and relatives as servants. My blessing will richly provide him with grain and new wine. What more is left for me to do for you, my son?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">Esau pleaded with his father, &amp;apos;Is that the only blessing you have to give? Bless me too, my father!&amp;apos; Esau could not hold back his tears and he wept loudly.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">Then Isaac his father spoke these words:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">You will live by the sword and serve your brother;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">Esau hated Jacob because he stole his blessing. He said to himself, &amp;apos;In a short time my father will be gone. After the time for mourning his death has passed, I will kill my brother Jacob!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">But when Rebekah found out about her older son Esau&amp;quot;s plan, she quickly sent for her younger son Jacob, and said to him, &amp;apos;Listen, your brother Esau is planning to exact revenge by killing you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43">My son, you must do what I say. Run away at once to my brother Laban in Haran.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44">You can live with him for a while until your brother calms down.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45">After your brother&amp;quot;s anger has died down and he has forgotten what you&amp;quot;ve done to him, I will send a messenger to bring you back from there. Why should I lose both my sons in one day?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46">Later, Rebekah said to Isaac, &amp;apos;I&amp;quot;m so disgusted with our Hittite daughters-in-law. I&amp;quot;d rather die than see Jacob marry one of these local girls&amp;ndash;these Hittite women!&amp;apos;</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="28">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Before Jacob left, Isaac called for him, blessed him, and gave him these instructions: &amp;apos;I forbid you to marry any Canaanite woman.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Leave at once for the land of your grandfather Bethuel in Paddan-Aram and find one of the young women there to marry, one of your uncle Laban&amp;quot;s daughters.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">May the God who is always more than enough bless you abundantly . May he make you fruitful and multiply your descendants until you become many tribes!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">May he impart to you and your seed the blessing of Abraham so that you may possess the land where you now live as a foreigner&amp;ndash;the land God gave to Abraham.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Then Isaac sent Jacob on his way to Paddan-Aram, the land of his grandfather Bethuel the Aramean, to the home of Laban, Bethuel&amp;quot;s son and the brother of Rebekah, the mother of Jacob and Esau.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Esau had learned that Isaac had blessed Jacob and had sent him away to Paddan-Aram to find a wife there, and that while blessing him, Isaac had instructed him, &amp;apos;Don&amp;quot;t marry a Canaanite woman.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Furthermore, Esau found out that Jacob had obeyed his parents and fled to Paddan-Aram.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Esau, knowing that his father Isaac disapproved of Canaanite women,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">went to Ishmael&amp;quot;s clan and chose a woman named Mahalath to be one of his wives. She was the daughter of Ishmael, Abraham&amp;quot;s son, and sister of Nebaioth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Jacob left Beersheba and journeyed toward Haran.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">He encountered a certain place at sunset and camped there for the night. He took a stone from there, made it his pillow, and lay down to sleep.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">He had a dream of a stairway securely fixed on the earth and reaching into heaven. And there were messengers of God ascending and descending on the stairway.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">And Yahweh stood beside him and said to him, &amp;apos;I am Yahweh , the God of your father Abraham and the God of Isaac. You are lying on the very ground that I will give to you and your descendants.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="17">Terrified and overwhelmed, he said, &amp;apos;How awesome is this place! I have stumbled right into the House of God! This place is a portal , the very gate of heaven!&amp;apos;</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="29">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Jacob resumed his journey and entered the land east of Canaan .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">One day, Jacob came to a well out in the open country where the shepherds watered their animals. Three flocks of sheep and goats were lying near the well, which had a large, heavy stone covering the opening.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Whenever all the flocks gathered there, the shepherds would roll away the stone from the mouth of the well, water their sheep, and then roll the stone back over the top of the well.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Jacob approached them and said, &amp;apos;Good day, friends; where are you from?&amp;apos; &amp;apos;We&amp;quot;re from Haran,&amp;apos; they answered. &amp;apos;We do,&amp;apos; they replied.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">&amp;apos;Do you happen to know Laban, a grandson of Nahor?&amp;apos; Jacob said.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Jacob asked, &amp;apos;How&amp;quot;s he doing?&amp;apos; &amp;apos;He&amp;quot;s doing well,&amp;apos; they answered. &amp;apos;As a matter of fact, here comes his daughter Rachel right now with her flock.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Jacob said to them, &amp;apos;Look, it&amp;quot;s not time for the animals to gather together here; it&amp;quot;s now the hottest hour of the day. Let&amp;quot;s go ahead and water the sheep, then you can go and pasture them.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">They replied, &amp;apos;First, we have to wait until all the flocks are gathered. After that, the stone needs to be rolled away from the mouth of the well, then we&amp;quot;ll water the animals.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">While they were still speaking, Rachel, the shepherdess, drew near to the well with her father&amp;quot;s sheep.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">As soon as Jacob took one good look at Rachel, the beautiful daughter of his uncle Laban, he quickly went over to the mouth of the well and single-handedly rolled away the stone and watered all the flock of his uncle Laban!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Immediately, he walked up to Rachel and kissed her! Unable to hold back his tears , Jacob wept aloud.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">After he composed himself , he explained to Rachel, &amp;apos;I&amp;quot;m your father&amp;quot;s nephew, your aunt Rebekah&amp;quot;s son.&amp;apos; Upon hearing this, Rachel ran to tell her father.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">When Laban heard the news that his nephew Jacob had arrived at the well, he ran to greet him. Laban hugged and kissed Jacob and welcomed him into his home. After Jacob told him the story of all that happened,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Laban said to him, &amp;apos;Certainly, you are my own flesh and blood!&amp;apos; Jacob stayed with him for an entire month and worked for him .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Afterward, Laban said to Jacob, &amp;apos;Just because you&amp;quot;re my relative doesn&amp;quot;t mean I expect you to work for nothing. Tell me, what do you want your wages to be?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">(Now, Laban had two daughters; the older was Leah, and the younger was Rachel.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Rachel had a lovely figure and was gorgeous, but Leah&amp;quot;s eyes were weak. )</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Jacob had fallen in love with Rachel, so he answered Laban, &amp;apos;I will serve you for seven years for the hand of your younger daughter, Rachel!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Laban replied, &amp;apos;I&amp;quot;d rather give her to you than to some other man. Stay and work for me.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">So Jacob served Laban for seven years in exchange for Rachel, but because he loved her so deeply, the seven years seemed like only a few days.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">After the seven years, Jacob said to Laban, &amp;apos;My time is fulfilled; give me your daughter so that I may marry her and sleep with her.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">So Laban prepared a wedding feast and invited all the people of the surrounding area.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">That night, Laban tricked Jacob by bringing his older daughter Leah to Jacob&amp;quot;s tent, and he slept with her on his wedding night !</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">(Laban assigned Zilpah to be Leah&amp;quot;s servant.)</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">When Jacob woke up the next morning, he was shocked to find Leah lying next to him! So he confronted Laban and said, &amp;apos;What have you done to me? Didn&amp;quot;t I serve you these seven years for Rachel? Why have you tricked me?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">Laban answered, &amp;apos;It&amp;quot;s not our custom here to give the younger daughter in marriage before the older daughter is married.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">Wait until this bridal week of festivities is over, then I&amp;quot;ll give you Rachel, but you must serve me for another seven years.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">When Yahweh saw that Leah was unloved, he opened her womb, but Rachel remained childless.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">Leah conceived, gave birth to a son, and named him Reuben, saying, &amp;apos;Because Yahweh looked upon me with compassion in my misery, surely, my husband will love me now!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">She conceived again, gave birth to a son, and named him Simeon, saying, &amp;apos; Yahweh has heard that I am despised, and in his mercy, he has given me this son also.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">Leah conceived the third time, gave birth to a son, and named him Levi, saying, &amp;apos;This time my husband will be joined to me, because now I&amp;quot;ve given him three sons!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">Once again, Leah conceived and gave birth to a son. She named him Judah, saying, &amp;apos;This time I will praise the Lord!&amp;apos; Then she stopped bearing children for a while .</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="30">
			<VERS vnumber="1">When Rachel saw that she could not give Jacob children, her jealousy toward her sister simmered. So, she said to Jacob, &amp;apos;Give me sons, or I&amp;quot;ll die!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Jacob became furious with Rachel and said, &amp;apos;Am I God? He&amp;quot;s the one keeping you from bearing children!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">She replied, &amp;apos;Here&amp;quot;s my servant Bilhah. Sleep with her. She can be my surrogate; then I can have children through her and build a family.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">So Rachel gave her servant Bilhah to Jacob as another wife, and Jacob slept with her.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">And Bilhah conceived and bore Jacob a son,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">and Rachel named him Dan, saying, &amp;apos;God has vindicated me. He heard my voice and gave me a son.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Then her servant Bilhah conceived again and bore Jacob a second son.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Rachel named him Naphtali, saying, &amp;apos;I have wrestled mightily with my sister, and I won!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Meanwhile, when Leah saw that she had ceased bearing children, she took her servant Zilpah and gave her to Jacob as another wife.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Zilpah bore Jacob a second son,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">and Leah named him Asher, saying, &amp;apos;Oh happy day! All the women will say, &amp;quot;She&amp;quot;s happy now!&amp;quot; &amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">One day, during wheat harvest, Reuben found some mandrake plants in the field and brought them to his mother Leah. Rachel said to Leah, &amp;apos;Please give me some of your son&amp;quot;s mandrakes.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Leah replied, &amp;apos;You already took away the affection of my husband, so now you&amp;quot;re going to take my son&amp;quot;s mandrakes, too?&amp;apos; Rachel said, &amp;apos;All right then, I&amp;quot;ll let him sleep with you tonight in exchange for some of your son&amp;quot;s mandrakes.&amp;apos; &amp;apos;Nothing,&amp;apos; Jacob replied, &amp;apos;You don&amp;quot;t need to give me a thing. If you will do but one thing for me, I will continue to care for your flocks:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">That evening, when Jacob was coming home from the field, Leah went out to meet him and said, &amp;apos;You must sleep with me tonight, for I&amp;quot;ve paid for your services with my son&amp;quot;s mandrakes.&amp;apos; So Jacob slept with Leah that night.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">God listened compassionately to Leah&amp;quot;s cry, she became pregnant, and bore Jacob a fifth son,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">whom she named Issachar, saying, &amp;apos;God rewarded me for giving my maidservant to my husband.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Once again, Leah conceived and bore Jacob a sixth son,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">whom she named Zebulun, saying, &amp;apos;God has given me good gifts for my husband! Now he will accept me, for I&amp;quot;ve given him six sons.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Lastly, Leah gave birth to a daughter and named her Dinah.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">God listened to Rachel&amp;quot;s heart-cry, and had compassion on her, and made her fertile.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">After Rachel gave birth to Joseph, Jacob said to Laban, &amp;apos;Release me to go back home to my homeland.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">You know how hard I&amp;quot;ve worked for you these many years to finish paying for my two wives. Give them to me along with my children, and I&amp;quot;ll be on my way.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">Laban countered, &amp;apos;If you please, I have learned by divine inquiry that I have become prosperous because of you and the blessing of Yahweh that&amp;quot;s on your life .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">Just name your price, and I&amp;quot;ll give it to you.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">Jacob replied, &amp;apos;You know how hard I&amp;quot;ve worked for you and how your livestock has increased under my care.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">The little you had before I came has multiplied greatly, for Yahweh has blessed you wonderfully because I am here. But now, I need to provide for my own family, too.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">So Laban asked, &amp;apos;What should I give you?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">Just let me pass through all your flocks today and take out every speckled and spotted sheep or goat, and every black lamb. That&amp;quot;s all the payment I ask.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">And in the future, when you review my wages, the integrity of my dealings with you will be obvious. If you find any animal among mine that is not speckled, spotted, or black, then you will know that I stole it.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">&amp;apos;Agreed!&amp;apos; Laban said. &amp;apos;We&amp;quot;ll do what you&amp;quot;ve suggested.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">But that same day, Laban secretly removed all the male and female goats that were speckled or spotted (all that had white on them) and all the black lambs and left them under the care of his sons.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">He set a distance of a three-day journey between himself and Jacob, while Jacob continued to tend the rest of Laban&amp;quot;s flocks.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">Jacob, however, cut green branches of poplar, almond, and plane trees and peeled back part of their bark, to expose the white inner wood of the branches.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">Then he set the partially peeled branches inside the water troughs where the goats would see them when they came to drink.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">For they mated when they came to the water troughs, and as they lowered their heads to drink , they saw the stripped branches in front of their eyes. Miraculously they gave birth to streaked, speckled, and spotted young.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">But with the mating ewes, on the other hand, he made them face the streaked or completely black animals in Laban&amp;quot;s flock. By doing this, he produced his own special flocks, which he didn&amp;quot;t allow to mingle with Laban&amp;quot;s.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">Moreover, every time the stronger females were in heat, Jacob laid the partially peeled branches in the water troughs in front of the flock, so that they would mate among the branches.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">But he didn&amp;quot;t place the branches in front of the scrawny goats when they mated, leaving the feeble animals for Laban and the stronger for himself.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43">In this way, Jacob quickly grew very wealthy and owned large flocks, a great number of camels and donkeys, and many male and female servants.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="31">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Now Jacob heard that the sons of Laban were complaining, &amp;apos;Everything Jacob owns he has taken from our father! He gained all his wealth from what our father owned.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">And Jacob saw that Laban no longer viewed him favorably as he once did.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Then Yahweh said to Jacob, &amp;apos;Return to the land of your ancestors where you were born; and remember , I will be with you.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">So Jacob sent a message for Leah and Rachel to meet him in the field where his flocks were grazing .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">When they arrived, he said to them, &amp;apos;I can see that your father&amp;quot;s attitude toward me has changed, but the God of my father has been with me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">You both know I have worked for your father as hard as I could,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">although he has cheated me and reduced my wages over and over. Yet God has not allowed him to harm me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">If he said, &amp;quot;The speckled ones will be your wages,&amp;quot; then all the flock bore speckled. If he said, &amp;quot;The striped ones will be your wages,&amp;quot; then all the flock bore striped.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Because of these miracles , God has taken away your father&amp;quot;s livestock and given them to me!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Jacob continued , &amp;apos;Once during the breeding season, I had a dream. I saw that the male goats who were mating were all speckled, streaked, or spotted.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">In the dream, the angel of God called me by my name, &amp;quot;Jacob.&amp;quot; &amp;apos; &amp;apos; &amp;quot;I am here,&amp;quot; I answered.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">&amp;apos;Then he said, &amp;quot;Observe and note that all the male goats that are mating are speckled, streaked, or spotted, for I have seen all that Laban is doing to you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">I am the God who appeared to you at Bethel, where you anointed a pillar and made a vow to me. Now leave this land at once and return to the land of your birth.&amp;quot; &amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Then Rachel and Leah answered him, &amp;apos;Our father doesn&amp;quot;t want us to inherit a portion from his estate.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Hasn&amp;quot;t he treated us as outsiders and not as members of his family ? Not only did he sell us like property , but he has also spent our purchase price!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Our father&amp;quot;s wealth that God has given you was legally ours and our children to begin with! So, go ahead and do whatever God has told you.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Jacob immediately put his wives and children on camels</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">and took with him all the livestock and everything he had amassed in Paddan-Aram. He set out to return to his father Isaac in the land of Canaan.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">One day, when Laban had gone to his fields to shear his sheep, Rachel stole her father&amp;quot;s household idols.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Jacob had outwitted Laban the Aramean by secretly departing without telling him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">He fled with all that he had, and after crossing the Euphrates, he headed for the hill country of Gilead.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">And it wasn&amp;quot;t until three days later that Laban discovered Jacob had left.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">Laban, along with some of his relatives, took off in pursuit and chased after Jacob for seven days. He had almost caught up with him in the hill country of Gilead,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">when God appeared to Laban the Aramean in a dream and warned him, &amp;apos;Be careful that you neither harm nor threaten Jacob.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">Now Jacob had set up his camp with his flocks on a hill, and Laban had him in his sights. Laban and his companions set up their camp nearby.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">Laban approached Jacob and said, &amp;apos; Nephew , what have you done? You&amp;quot;ve deceived me and carried away my daughters like captives on a battlefield.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">Why did you trick me and run away in secret without telling me? I would have sent you off joyously, celebrating with singing and dancing to the tambourine and stringed instruments.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">And why did you not even let me kiss my daughters and grandchildren goodbye? What you have done is foolish!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">I could harm you, but the God of your father spoke to me in a dream last night, saying, &amp;quot;Be careful that you neither harm nor threaten Jacob.&amp;quot;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">Now I realize you ran away because you desperately long to return to your father&amp;quot;s house, but why did you steal my gods?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">&amp;apos; I left in a hurry because I was afraid,&amp;apos; Jacob answered, &amp;apos;and I thought you would take your daughters from me by force.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">Whoever has taken your gods will be put to death! So here, in the presence of our relatives, if you can find among our possessions anything that is yours, take it.&amp;apos; Now Jacob had no clue that Rachel had stolen the gods.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">Laban went immediately into Jacob&amp;quot;s tent to search. Then he went into the tents of Zilpah and Bilhah but found nothing. After searching Leah&amp;quot;s tent, he went into Rachel&amp;quot;s.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">Now Rachel had taken the family gods and put them in her camel&amp;quot;s cushion and sat on them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">She said to her father, &amp;apos;Please my father, don&amp;quot;t be angry if I don&amp;quot;t rise before you, for I&amp;quot;m having my period.&amp;apos; When he rummaged through her tent, he did not find them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">Then Jacob became angry and complained to Laban, &amp;apos;What have I done wrong? What sin have I committed that you would hotly pursue me as if you were chasing a criminal ?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">You have rummaged through all my things, and did you find anything of your own property? If you did, set them here in front of your relatives and mine. Let them decide between the two of us.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">Jacob continued , &amp;apos;For the last twenty years I have served you, and the whole time your sheep and goats did not miscarry, nor did I feast on any of your rams.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">If one from your flock was mauled by a wild beast, I didn&amp;quot;t bring it to you; I absorbed the loss myself. And you always made me pay for any missing animal, whether snatched by day or by night.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">Many times, scorching heat consumed me by day and hard frost by night; I endured sleepless nights.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">For these twenty years that I&amp;quot;ve lived among you, I slaved away fourteen years for your two daughters, and six years for your flocks. And besides all that , you&amp;quot;ve reduced my wages over and over.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">If the God of my father, the God of Abraham, and the Awesome One of Isaac , had not been on my side, you certainly would have sent me away empty-handed! But God in his mercy took notice of how much I&amp;quot;ve suffered and how hard I&amp;quot;ve worked&amp;ndash;and that&amp;quot;s why he rebuked you last night in your dream !&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43">Laban replied to Jacob, &amp;apos;These women are my daughters, these children are my grandchildren; and the flocks are mine. In fact, everything you see belongs to me. But from today I will not be able to do anything more for my daughters and grandchildren.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44">Come now, let&amp;quot;s form a covenant between you and me. Let it endure as a witness between us.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45">So Jacob took a stone, set it up as a pillar,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46">and in the presence of his relatives, he said to them, &amp;apos;Everyone gather stones, and place them here in a pile.&amp;apos; And they did so, and afterward, they ate together next to the heap of stones.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="47">Laban and Jacob named the place in both languages, Aramaic and Hebrew , calling it Witness Heap.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="48">And Laban said, &amp;apos;Today, this heap of stones will be a witness between you and me of our enduring friendship .&amp;apos; He called it Witness Heap</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="49">and Watchpost, for Laban declared, &amp;apos;May Yahweh keep his eyes on us when we are absent from each other.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="50">If you mistreat my daughters or marry other women besides my daughters, remember that even though no one else is with us, God is watching us.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="51">Here is the heap of stones and here is the memorial pillar that stands between us.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="52">This heap and this pillar stand as witnesses that I will never pass beyond them to harm you and that you will never pass beyond them to harm me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="53">Now may the God of Abraham and the god of Nahor judge between us!&amp;apos; Jacob made his vow by the Awesome One of his father Isaac.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="54">Then Jacob offered a sacrifice on the mountain and called everyone together for a meal, and they remained there all night on the mountain.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="55">Early the next morning, Laban kissed his daughters and grandchildren, blessed them, and then he returned home.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="32">
			<VERS vnumber="1">As Jacob continued toward Canaan , the angels of God came to meet him!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">When he saw them, he exclaimed, &amp;apos;This is God&amp;quot;s military camp!&amp;apos; So he named that place Two Camps of Angels .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Jacob sent messengers ahead to his brother Esau who was living in the land of Seir, the country of Edom.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">He instructed them, &amp;apos;Give this message from me to my master Esau, &amp;quot;I am your servant. I have lived with our uncle Laban all these years</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">and have acquired sheep, cattle, donkeys, and both male and female servants. I send this message to you, my master, in the hope of finding favor in your eyes.&amp;quot; &amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">When the messengers returned to Jacob, they informed him, &amp;apos;We gave your brother Esau your message, and he himself is coming here to meet you. In fact, he&amp;quot;s on his way now with four hundred men!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Gripped with fear to the point of panic, Jacob split all the people who were with him into two camps, and also the flocks, herds, and camels.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">He said to himself, &amp;apos;If Esau attacks the first camp and destroys them, at least the other camp will escape.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Then Jacob prayed, &amp;apos; Yahweh , God of my father Abraham and God of my father Isaac, you said to me, &amp;quot;Return to your country and to your family, and I will make you prosper.&amp;quot;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">I am so unworthy of all the loving-kindness and faithfulness that you have showered upon me, your servant. When I crossed this river Jordan years ago , all I had to my name was a staff in my hand, and now I have increased to become two camps!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Save me, I pray, from the hand of my brother Esau, for I&amp;quot;m afraid he will come and kill all of us, including the women and children.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">You said to me, &amp;quot;I will certainly prosper you and make your offspring as innumerable as the sand of the sea.&amp;quot; &amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">So he spent the night there. From what he had with him, Jacob sent a gift to his brother Esau: But Jacob refused. &amp;apos;No! Not until you bless me!&amp;apos; &amp;apos;Why ask my name?&amp;apos; the man replied, then he spoke a blessing over Jacob.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">two hundred female goats and twenty male goats, two hundred ewes and twenty rams,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">thirty female camels and their calves, forty cows and ten bulls, twenty female donkeys and ten male donkeys.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">He placed them in the care of his servants, each herd by itself. He told them, &amp;apos;Go on ahead of me, and put some space between each herd.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">He gave these instructions to the one in the lead, &amp;apos;When my brother Esau meets you, and asks, &amp;quot;Who is your master? Where are you going? Who owns these herds you are driving?&amp;quot;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">then you are to say, &amp;quot;They belong to your servant Jacob. He&amp;quot;s sent them as a gift to you, my lord Esau, and he is coming behind us.&amp;quot; &amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">He likewise instructed the leaders of the second and the third herds and all those following them, &amp;apos;You must say the same thing when you meet Esau.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">And be sure to say, &amp;quot;Your servant Jacob is coming behind us,&amp;quot; &amp;apos; because he reasoned, &amp;apos;If I can appease Esau with these gifts before I have to meet him face-to-face, he may accept me.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">So he sent the gifts on ahead of him, while he spent that night in the camp.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">During the night, Jacob arose, woke up his two wives, his two maidservants, and eleven sons, and had them cross the ford of the Jabbok River.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">He sent them across along with everything he had,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">and Jacob was left all alone. Suddenly, out of nowhere , a man appeared and wrestled with him until daybreak.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">When the man saw that he was not winning the match, he struck Jacob&amp;quot;s hip and knocked it out of joint, leaving it wrenched as he continued to wrestle with him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">Eventually, the man said to him, &amp;apos;Let me go, for the day is breaking.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">&amp;apos;What is your name?&amp;apos; asked the man. &amp;apos;Jacob,&amp;apos; he replied.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">&amp;apos;Not anymore,&amp;apos; the man said to him. &amp;apos;Your new name is Israel, for you have struggled both with God and with people and have overcome.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">Jacob said, &amp;apos;Please, tell me your name.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">So Jacob named the place Penuel, saying, &amp;apos;I have seen God face-to-face, yet my life has been spared!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">The sun rose upon him as he crossed the Jabbok River from Penuel, limping because of his hip.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">To this day, the Israelites do not eat the thigh muscle attached to the hip socket, because the man struck Jacob&amp;quot;s hip socket at the thigh muscle.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="33">
			<VERS vnumber="1">When Jacob looked up, he saw Esau approaching with four hundred men. So he quickly divided the children among Leah, Rachel, and the two maidservants.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">He lined up the maidservants and their children in front, then Leah and her children, then Rachel and Joseph last of all.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Then Jacob went ahead of them to face Esau . As he approached his brother, he bowed down to the ground seven times before reaching him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">But Esau ran to Jacob and hugged him! He threw his arms around Jacob&amp;quot;s neck, he kissed him, and they wept in each other&amp;quot;s arms.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">When Esau looked up and saw the women and the children, he said to Jacob, &amp;apos;Who are all these coming behind you?&amp;apos; Jacob replied, &amp;apos;These are the children, your niece and nephews , whom God has so graciously given your servant.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Then the maidservants came forward with their children and bowed low before Esau.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Leah likewise came forward with her children and bowed down. Finally, Rachel and Joseph came forward and they bowed down to the ground before Esau.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Esau asked Jacob, &amp;apos;Why did you send all these animals to me?&amp;apos; &amp;apos;I was hoping to find favor with you, my lord,&amp;apos; Jacob replied. &amp;apos;You&amp;quot;re so kind,&amp;apos; Jacob replied, &amp;apos;but there&amp;quot;s no need to do so.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">&amp;apos;But my brother,&amp;apos; Esau laughed, &amp;apos;I have plenty. Keep what you have for yourself.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Jacob replied, &amp;apos;No, please. If I have found favor in your eyes, please take the gifts. For truly, seeing your face after all these years , it&amp;quot;s like looking upon the face of God! Since you have received me so warmly,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">please accept the blessing I have brought to you, for God has poured his grace over me, and I have everything I want!&amp;apos; So with these words Jacob urged him, and Esau accepted the gifts.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Then Esau said, &amp;apos;Let&amp;quot;s start out on our journey, and I&amp;quot;ll walk alongside you.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">But Jacob replied, &amp;apos;My lord, you can see how tired the children are, and all our flocks and herds are nursing their young. If we drive them too hard for even a day, they will die.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Please, my lord, go ahead of your servant. Let me move along slowly with my flocks and herds, to give them a chance to graze . I must think of my children, too, so go ahead of me, my lord, until I catch up with you in Seir.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Esau said, &amp;apos;Well, at least let me leave you with some of my men.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">So that very day Esau and his men left to return to Seir,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">but Jacob went the opposite direction to Succoth instead, and built himself a house there. He also built shelters for his livestock, and that is why Jacob named the place Succoth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Jacob&amp;quot;s journey home from Paddan-Aram finally brought him safe and sound to the Canaanite city of Shechem, where he camped just outside of the city.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">He purchased the field where he pitched his tent from the clan of Hamor, Shechem&amp;quot;s father, for one hundred pieces of silver.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">There he set up an altar and named it To the True God, the God of Israel.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="34">
			<VERS vnumber="1">One day, Jacob and Leah&amp;quot;s daughter, Dinah, went out to visit the neighborhood girls.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Now Hamor, the tribal chief of the Hivites, had a son named Shechem, who was the prince. When he saw how attractive Dinah was , he seized her and sexually assaulted her.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">His heart was drawn to Dinah, Jacob&amp;quot;s daughter, so he sought to win her affection and spoke tenderly to her.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Shechem went to his father Hamor and said, &amp;apos;Get me this girl to be my wife.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Now Jacob heard that Shechem had violated his daughter Dinah; but his sons were in the fields with his livestock, so he waited to act until his sons returned home.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Shechem&amp;quot;s father Hamor brought his son to speak with Jacob about marriage arrangements .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">During their conversation, Jacob&amp;quot;s sons came in from the field, and they heard the report of what Shechem had done to their sister Dinah. They were shocked and furious over the shameful act Shechem committed against Israel &amp;ndash;a criminal act of sexual assault that never should have happened.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">But Hamor tried to defuse the situation, saying, &amp;apos;Listen, my son Shechem is in love with your daughter. Please, give her to him in marriage.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Let&amp;quot;s allow our people to intermarry. Let your daughters marry our sons, and we will let our daughters marry your sons.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">You may settle here among us, live anywhere you wish, move about freely, and acquire property.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Then Shechem spoke up and said to Dinah&amp;quot;s family, &amp;apos;Please, let me find favor in your eyes. Whatever you require of me, I&amp;quot;ll pay.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Set the bride-price as high as you wish, no matter how expensive it is; I&amp;quot;ll pay whatever you ask. Only give me the young woman to be my wife.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">The sons of Jacob concocted a devious plan . Because of the rape of their sister Dinah, they answered Shechem and Hamor deceitfully,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">saying, &amp;apos;Our culture will not allow us to consent to our sister Dinah marrying someone who is uncircumcised, for that would be a disgrace to us.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">We would only approve of the marriage on one condition: you must circumcise every male among you and become as we are.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Then we will allow our daughters to marry your sons and your daughters to marry our sons. And we will live among you and become one people.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">But if you refuse to be circumcised, then we will take our sister and be gone.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">The offer pleased Hamor and his son Shechem.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">And the young man lost no time in doing what they asked, because Shechem really wanted to marry Jacob&amp;quot;s daughter! Now Shechem was the most honored in all his family,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">so Hamor and his son went to the gate of the city and spoke to the men, saying,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">&amp;apos;These people are our friends. Let them settle in our land and make themselves at home; there&amp;quot;s plenty of room in the country for them. And, let&amp;quot;s agree to exchange our daughters in marriage to them and to unite us as one people.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">They only have one condition in order to live among us and to unite with us as one people: every male among us must be circumcised as they are circumcised.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">Won&amp;quot;t all of their livestock and property become ours? Let us agree to their request, so they will live among us.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">So all the townsmen agreed with Hamor and his son Shechem, and every male of the city was circumcised.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">Three days later, while all the men were still suffering in pain, two of Jacob&amp;quot;s sons, Simeon and Levi, Dinah&amp;quot;s brothers, took their swords and attacked the unsuspecting city. They slaughtered every male of the city.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">They even killed Hamor and his son Shechem, and took Dinah from Shechem&amp;quot;s house, and left.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">Later, Jacob&amp;quot;s other sons came upon the dead bodies, and they looted the city as retribution for the violation of their sister.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">They seized the flocks, herds, and donkeys, and all that was in the city and in the field.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">They plundered all their wealth and their household goods and took their wives and children as captives.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">When Jacob found out, he said to Simeon and Levi, &amp;apos; What have you done? You have ruined my name, and now the Canaanites and Perizzites and all the people of this land will hate me! My men are so few that if they unite against me and attack, I and all my household will be destroyed!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">But they answered him, &amp;apos;Why should they treat our sister like a whore?&amp;apos;</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="35">
			<VERS vnumber="1">God said to Jacob, &amp;apos;Arise, go at once to Bethel, and settle there. Build an altar there to God, who appeared to you when you were fleeing from your brother Esau.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">So Jacob said to his household and to all who were with him, &amp;apos;Get rid of every foreign god you have, purify yourselves, and change your clothes.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Then come with me; let us go up to Bethel. I will build an altar there to God who answered my prayer when I was in distress and whose presence has been with me wherever I have gone.&amp;apos;</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="6">Jacob and all the people who were with him arrived in the land of Canaan at Luz, now known as Bethel.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">He built an altar there and named it El-Bethel, because it was the place that God had unveiled himself when Jacob was running from his brother.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">During that time, Rebekah&amp;quot;s nurse Deborah died. They buried her under an oak tree near Bethel, and they named the place Weeping Oak.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">After Jacob returned from Paddan-Aram, God appeared to him once again and blessed him,</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="3">Now Israel&amp;quot;s love for Joseph surpassed that for his other sons because he was born to him in his old age. So Israel had made him a richly ornamented robe.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">When Joseph&amp;quot;s brothers saw that their father loved him more than he loved them, they hated him and would not speak a kind word to him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">One night Joseph had a dream, and when he shared it with his brothers, they hated him even more!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">&amp;apos;Listen to this dream I had,&amp;apos; he told them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">&amp;apos;There we were, binding sheaves of grain in the field. Suddenly, my sheaf rose up and stood upright. Then your sheaves gathered around mine and bowed down to mine!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">His brothers asked him, &amp;apos;Oh, so you think you&amp;quot;re going to be our king? Do you actually think you&amp;quot;re destined to rule over us?&amp;apos; So, the dream that he told them about made them hate him even more.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Then another night he had a dream, and he shared it with his brothers, saying, &amp;apos;Listen, I had another dream. This time, the sun and moon and eleven stars were bowing down to me.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">When his father and brothers heard it, his father scolded him, &amp;apos;What kind of dream is that? Do you really think that I, and your mother, and your brothers are going to come and bow to the ground before you?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">So his brothers grew more jealous of him, but his father kept pondering Joseph&amp;quot;s dream.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">One day, when his brothers had gone to Shechem to care for their father&amp;quot;s flock,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Israel called for Joseph and said to him, &amp;apos;Your brothers are grazing the flocks near Shechem. I want you to go join them.&amp;apos; &amp;apos; Yes , Father , I&amp;quot;ll go.&amp;apos; Joseph replied. When Joseph arrived at Shechem</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Jacob added, &amp;apos;Go find out how your brothers are doing with the flocks and bring word back to me.&amp;apos; So, his father sent him off from the valley of Hebron.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">and began to roam the countryside looking for his brothers, a man approached him and asked, &amp;apos;What are you looking for?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">&amp;apos;I&amp;quot;m looking for my brothers, who are taking care of their flock,&amp;apos; he answered. &amp;apos;Please tell me, do you know where they are?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">The man replied, &amp;apos;They&amp;quot;ve left here already. I overheard them mention that they were going to Dothan.&amp;apos; So, Joseph took off to catch up with his brothers and found them at Dothan.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">As he was still a long distance away, the brothers recognized him by his robe , and by the time he reached them, they had plotted together to kill him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">They said to each other, &amp;apos;Here comes this dream expert.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Let&amp;quot;s kill him and throw his body into one of these dry wells. We can say that a wild animal ate him. Then we&amp;quot;ll see how his dreams turn out!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">When Reuben heard of this, he tried to save Joseph&amp;quot;s life. &amp;apos;Don&amp;quot;t take his life,&amp;apos; he said.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">&amp;apos;No bloodshed! Let&amp;quot;s throw him into this pit in the middle of nowhere, but don&amp;quot;t hurt him.&amp;apos; Reuben said these things because he planned to return later to rescue Joseph and take him back to his father.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">When Joseph finally caught up with his brothers, they seized him , stripped him of his ornamented robe, his beautiful full-length robe,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">and threw him into the dry, empty pit.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">Afterward, the brothers sat down to eat their food. When they looked up, they saw a caravan of Ishmaelite merchants coming from Gilead on their way to Egypt. They had many camels loaded with myrrh, spices, and perfumes.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">Judah spoke up and said to his brothers, &amp;apos;What will we gain by murdering our brother and covering up his blood?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">I have an idea! Let&amp;quot;s sell Joseph to these Ishmaelites and not lay a hand on him, for he is our brother, our own flesh and blood.&amp;apos; His brothers agreed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">And when the Midianites (also known as Ishmaelites) came by, Joseph&amp;quot;s brothers lifted him out of the pit, and sold him to the Ishmaelites for twenty pieces of silver, and the merchants took Joseph far away to Egypt.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">Later, Reuben went to the pit, and saw that Joseph was gone. He was overcome with grief and tore his clothes.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">He went to his brothers and said, &amp;apos;The boy is gone! What am I going to do now?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">Then they took Joseph&amp;quot;s colorful robe, killed a goat, and dipped the robe in its blood.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">They took the blood-stained robe back to their father and said, &amp;apos;We found this. Look it over&amp;ndash;doesn&amp;quot;t it belong to your son?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">Jacob recognized it instantly and cried out, &amp;apos;It&amp;quot;s my son&amp;quot;s robe! Some wild animal must have killed him. My son Joseph has been torn to pieces!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">Overcome with grief , Jacob tore his clothes, put on sackcloth, and mourned for his son a long time.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">All his sons and daughters came and tried to comfort him, but he refused to be comforted. He told them, &amp;apos;No, I will mourn for him the rest of my life, until I join my son in the realm of the dead.&amp;apos; Joseph&amp;quot;s father wept and wept for his son.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">Meanwhile, the Midianites took Joseph to Egypt and sold him to Potiphar, one of Pharaoh&amp;quot;s officials, the captain of the guard.</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="38">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Around that time, Judah left his brothers at Hebron and went to Adullam to stay with a man named Hirah.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">There he met and married a Canaanite girl, the daughter of Shua. He slept with her and</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">she became pregnant and gave birth to a son, and Judah named him Er.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">She conceived again and gave birth to another son and named him Onan.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">While they were staying in Chezib, she gave birth to a third son and named him Shelah.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">When their sons were grown , Judah arranged for Er, his oldest son, to marry a girl named Tamar.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">But Er had become so wicked in the sight of Yahweh that Yahweh ended his life.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Then Judah said to Er&amp;quot;s brother Onan, &amp;apos;Your duty is to join yourself to her. Go perform your duty as a brother-in-law and provide an heir for your brother.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Onan, however, did not want to produce a child that would not be his own rightful heir , so whenever he and Tamar had intercourse, he purposely spilled his semen onto the ground to keep her from getting pregnant and having a child that would belong to his dead brother.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">But what he did was wicked in Yahweh &amp;quot;s sight, so he took Onan&amp;quot;s life also.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Then Judah said to his daughter-in-law Tamar, &amp;apos;Live as a widow in your father&amp;quot;s house until my youngest son Shelah grows up.&amp;apos; So Tamar went home to her parents, but Judah worried that Shelah would end up dead like his brothers.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">After some time passed, Judah&amp;quot;s wife, the daughter of Shua, died. When his time of mourning was over, he and his friend Hirah the Adullamite went to Timnah to enjoy the festivities at the sheep-shearing.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">He responded, &amp;apos;I will send you a young goat from the flock.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Soon afterward, Judah sent the young goat by his friend Hirah the Adullamite to recover his items from the prostitute, but she was nowhere to be found.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">So he asked the townspeople, &amp;apos;Where is the temple prostitute that sits by the crossroads?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">So he returned to Judah and informed him, &amp;apos;I couldn&amp;quot;t find her, and besides that, the townspeople said that no prostitute has been there.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">Judah replied, &amp;apos;Let her keep my pledge. If we try to go get it now , we&amp;quot;ll become a laughingstock. After all, I did send you with the payment I promised her, and you couldn&amp;quot;t find her.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">About three months later, Judah was told, &amp;apos;Your daughter-in-law Tamar has been promiscuous, and now she is pregnant!&amp;apos; Indignant, Judah said, &amp;apos;Bring her out, and let her be burned!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">As she was being brought out, she sent word to her father-in-law, &amp;apos;Look, the one who owns these things got me pregnant! See, whose signet and staff are these?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">Judah recognized them as his and said, &amp;apos;She is more righteous than I, for I never gave my son Shelah to marry her.&amp;apos; And he let her go free and never slept with her again.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">When it was time for her to give birth, there were twins in her womb!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">While she was in labor, one hand popped out, so the midwife wrapped a crimson thread around its wrist, saying, &amp;apos;This one came out first.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">But immediately, he drew his hand back, and out came his brother; and she said, &amp;apos;Look how you have broken out of the womb!&amp;apos; So, he was named Perez, the one who breaks through .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">Afterward, his brother came out, the one with the crimson thread on his wrist. That&amp;quot;s why they named him Zerah (&amp;apos; the crimson one &amp;apos;).</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1">After the Ishmaelite traders brought Joseph down to Egypt, he was purchased by an Egyptian officer of Pharaoh, the captain of the guard, whose name was Potiphar.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Yahweh &amp;quot;s presence was with Joseph and he became successful while living in the house of his Egyptian master.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">When his master realized that Yahweh &amp;quot;s presence was with Joseph and caused everything he did to prosper,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Joseph found favor with Potiphar. He was quickly promoted to become the overseer of Potiphar&amp;quot;s house and was put in charge of all that he had.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">From the moment Potiphar appointed Joseph over his household, Yahweh blessed the Egyptian&amp;quot;s affairs for Joseph&amp;quot;s sake. The blessing of Yahweh was upon everything Potiphar owned; his finances increased, his crops flourished, and his flocks and herds multiplied.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">So Potiphar placed all that he owned under Joseph&amp;quot;s oversight. And with Joseph in charge, Potiphar had nothing to worry about, except deciding on what to eat! Now Joseph was strikingly handsome, very good-looking, and well-built.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">It wasn&amp;quot;t long before his master&amp;quot;s wife noticed Joseph. She demanded: &amp;apos;Come make love to me.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">&amp;apos;Never!&amp;apos; Joseph replied. &amp;apos;Don&amp;quot;t you realize that my master has nothing to worry about with me in charge, for he has put everything he has under my care?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">There is no one greater in his household than me, nor has he kept anything back from me except you, because you&amp;quot;re his wife. Why would I want to do such an immoral thing and sin against God?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Yet day after day, she was determined to seduce him. But Joseph continually refused her advances and would not even go near her.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Then one day, when he had to go into the house to do his work and no one else was there,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">she grabbed him by his robe and said, &amp;apos;Come on, sleep with me!&amp;apos; But he abruptly ran out of the house, leaving his robe in her hands!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Realizing he had fled, and she was holding his robe in her hands,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">she called for her household servants and said to them, &amp;apos;See! My husband brings this Hebrew foreigner here to make fools of us! He barged into my house and tried to have sex with me, and I screamed;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">and when he heard me scream for help, he ran out of the house and left his robe!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">She kept the robe beside her until his master came home</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">and she told him the same story: &amp;apos;This Hebrew foreigner you brought among us barged into the house and tried to violate me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">As soon as I screamed out for help, he ran outside and left his robe here beside me.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">When his master heard his wife&amp;quot;s account about how his servant had treated her, he became furious.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">So Joseph&amp;quot;s master took him and threw him into prison, the place where the king&amp;quot;s prisoners are confined, and he was left there.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="22">The warden put all the prisoners under Joseph&amp;quot;s care; he was placed in charge of all the prisoners and everything in the prison.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1">Some time later, both Pharaoh&amp;quot;s chief steward and chief baker deeply offended their master, the king of Egypt.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Pharaoh was angry with his two officers, the chief steward and the chief baker,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">so he incarcerated them in the palace of Potiphar, the captain of the guard, in the same prison where Joseph was bound.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">The captain of the guard placed them under Joseph&amp;quot;s charge, and they remained in custody for some time.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Then one night, they both dreamed&amp;ndash;the steward and the baker, officials of the king of Egypt. They each had a prophetic dream with different interpretations.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">When Joseph came to them in the morning, he saw they looked miserable,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">so he asked Pharaoh&amp;quot;s two officials who were under his custody, &amp;apos; What&amp;quot;s wrong? Why the sad faces?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">&amp;apos;We had dreams last night,&amp;apos; they answered, &amp;apos;and we have no one to interpret them.&amp;apos; And Joseph said to them, &amp;apos;God can interpret your dreams! Please, tell them to me.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">I was holding Pharaoh&amp;quot;s cup, so I took the grapes, squeezed them into his cup, and handed the cup to the king.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Joseph said to him, &amp;apos; God has given me the interpretation of your dream: The three branches are three days.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">In three days, Pharaoh will pardon you and restore you to your post. You will once again hand Pharaoh&amp;quot;s cup to him as you used to do as his steward.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">When things start to go well for you, remember me, and please be kind and mention me to Pharaoh so that he might release me from here.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">For I was kidnapped from the land of the Hebrews, and I have done nothing here to deserve being thrown into this dungeon.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">When the chief baker saw how favorably Joseph interpreted the dream, he said to him, &amp;apos; Let me tell you my dream . I saw three wicker breadbaskets stacked on my head one above the other .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">In the top basket, I saw all kinds of bread and pastries for Pharaoh to enjoy, but the birds came and ate out of the basket above my head.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Joseph said, &amp;apos; God has given me the interpretation of your dream: The three baskets are three days.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">In three days, Pharaoh will behead you and impale you on a pole, and birds will eat the flesh off your corpse.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Three days later, it was Pharaoh&amp;quot;s birthday, and he threw a huge feast for all his household. He singled out among his servants the chief steward and the chief baker.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">He pardoned the chief steward and restored him to his post, and the steward handed Pharaoh his drink.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">But he had the chief baker beheaded and impaled on a pole. So, Joseph had accurately interpreted both their dreams,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">but the chief steward completely forgot about Joseph and never remembered him.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="41">
			<VERS vnumber="1">After two full years, Pharaoh dreamed that he was standing by the Nile,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">and up from the river emerged seven healthy, fat cows, and they began grazing in the marshland.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Then he saw seven other cows come up out of the Nile right behind them. They were ugly and thin, and they stood beside the fat cows on the riverbank.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">The seven ugly, thin cows ate up the seven healthy, fat cows. After Pharaoh&amp;quot;s dream he awoke</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">and fell back to sleep. He dreamed a second time. In his dream, he saw seven ears of grain, plump, ripe, and growing on a single stalk.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Close behind them sprouted seven ears of grain, thin and shriveled by the east wind.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">And the seven thin ears swallowed up the seven plump and full ears. Then Pharaoh awoke from his vivid and disturbing dream!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">The next morning, his spirit was agitated, so he called for all the magicians and wise men in Egypt. Pharaoh recounted his dreams to them, but no one could give him the interpretation.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">When the chief steward heard about the dreams he remembered Joseph and said to Pharaoh, &amp;apos; Please , your dream reminds me today of my failures.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Once, when Pharaoh was angry with his servants, he incarcerated me and the chief baker in the prison of Potiphar, the captain of the guard.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">We both had dreams on the same night but with different meanings.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">There was a young Hebrew man imprisoned with us who had been the personal servant to the captain of the guard. And when we told him our dreams, he interpreted them and told each of us their meaning.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">And it happened just as he said. Pharaoh restored me to my post, but he had the baker impaled.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">After hearing this, Pharaoh immediately sent for Joseph. They rushed him out of the dungeon to prepare him to meet with the king . When he had shaved and changed his clothes, he came and stood before Pharaoh.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Pharaoh said to Joseph, &amp;apos;I have had two dreams that no one can explain. I have heard that you are able to interpret a dream the moment you hear it.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">&amp;apos;I cannot do it alone,&amp;apos; Joseph replied, &amp;apos;but God will help me to give Pharaoh the proper interpretation for Pharaoh&amp;quot;s welfare.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Then Pharaoh told Joseph, &amp;apos;In my dream I was standing on the bank of the Nile,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">and up from the river emerged seven healthy, fat cows, and they began to graze in the marshland.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Right behind them followed seven other scrawny and emaciated cows. Never have I seen such ugly cows in all the land of Egypt!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">The seven ugly, scrawny cows ate up the healthy, fat cows,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">but after consuming them, no one could tell that they had eaten them, for they looked just as bad as before. I awoke with a start ,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">but immediately went back to sleep and had another dream. I saw seven ears of grain, full and ripe, growing on a single stalk.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">Right behind them sprouted seven thin, shriveled ears, scorched by the east wind.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">The seven shriveled ears swallowed up the seven healthy ears. I have shared my dreams with my magicians, but no one can give me an interpretation.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">Then Joseph said to Pharaoh, &amp;apos;Both your dreams tell the same story, for God has prophetically told Pharaoh what he is about to do.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">Both the seven healthy cows and the seven healthy ears represent seven good years; it&amp;quot;s the same dream.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">The seven ugly and scrawny cows that followed and the seven shriveled ears scorched by the east wind are seven years also. They represent seven years of famine.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">It is just as I have told Pharaoh; God has divinely revealed what he is about to do.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">There will come seven years of great abundance throughout all the land of Egypt,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">The reason that Pharaoh&amp;quot;s dream was repeated is that God has determined that it will surely happen, and that he will soon carry it out.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">Joseph continued , &amp;apos;Let Pharaoh select a very wise and discerning man and set him over the land of Egypt.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">Let Pharaoh appoint other officials throughout the land to collect one-fifth of all the crops each year during the seven plentiful years.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">Have them gather all the food of these abundant years that are coming, and under Pharaoh&amp;quot;s authority, have the grain stored in the cities for food.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">Store it all as food reserve for the people during the seven years of famine coming upon Egypt, so that the land will survive the famine.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">Joseph&amp;quot;s proposal pleased Pharaoh and all his advisers.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">He said to them, &amp;apos;Where can we find anyone else like this one, for he has the Spirit of God in him!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">So Pharaoh turned to Joseph and said, &amp;apos;Since God has divinely revealed this to you, there is no one as wise and full of insight as you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">I hereby place you in charge of all my affairs, and all my people will obey your commands. Only I, the king, will be greater than you!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">&amp;apos;Listen to me, Joseph,&amp;apos; Pharaoh continued. &amp;apos;I am placing you in charge of all of Egypt.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">Then he removed his signet ring, placed it on Joseph&amp;quot;s finger, and had him clothed with fine linen robes! He adorned him with a golden collar around his neck.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43">Pharaoh had him ride in the chariot reserved for the second-in-command and sent runners going before him, crying out, &amp;apos;Kneel!&amp;apos; In this way, Pharaoh placed Joseph over all the land of Egypt.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44">Pharaoh also said to Joseph, &amp;apos;I am Pharaoh. No one in all of Egypt will lift a finger without your permission!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45">Pharaoh gave Joseph a new name: Revealer of Secrets. He also arranged for him to marry the daughter of Potiphera, the priest of Heliopolis. Her name was Asenath. And Joseph took charge over all the land of Egypt.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46">Joseph was thirty years old when he entered the service of Pharaoh, king of Egypt. Leaving Pharaoh&amp;quot;s presence, Joseph traveled throughout the entire land of Egypt.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="47">During the seven years of abundance, the land produced bumper crops.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="48">Joseph supervised the gathering up of all the great stores of food of the seven years of abundance and strategically placed them in various walled cities near where the harvest was gathered.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="49">He gathered such massive quantities of produce that he gave up trying to measure it all, for it was like counting the sand on the seashore.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="50">Prior to the famine, Joseph and Asenath, daughter of Potiphera, priest of Heliopolis, had two sons.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="51">Joseph named the firstborn Manasseh, saying, &amp;apos;God has made me forget all my troubles and my parental home.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="52">The second he named Ephraim, saying, &amp;apos;God has made me fruitful in the land of my suffering.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="53">Eventually, Egypt&amp;quot;s seven years of abundance came to an end.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="54">Then began the seven years of famine, just as Joseph prophesied. Although there was a severe famine everywhere else, food was available throughout the land of Egypt.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="55">When the Egyptians grew hungry, the people cried out to Pharaoh for food. Then Pharaoh said to all his people, &amp;apos;Go to Joseph and do whatever he tells you.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="56">As the famine worsened over all the land, Joseph opened all the storehouses and sold grain to the Egyptians, for the famine was severe everywhere.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="57">So because of the severity of the worldwide famine, people from all over the world had to come and buy grain from Joseph.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="3">So Joseph&amp;quot;s ten half brothers went down to buy grain in Egypt,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">but Jacob did not send Joseph&amp;quot;s full brother Benjamin with them, because he feared something might happen to him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">So Israel&amp;quot;s sons were among those who went to Egypt to buy grain, for the famine in the land of Canaan was severe.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Now Joseph was the governor of the land of Egypt, which meant he supervised the sale of grain to all the people. One day , Joseph&amp;quot;s ten brothers came and bowed down before him with their faces on the ground.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">As soon as Joseph saw them, he realized that they were his brothers! But he pretended he didn&amp;quot;t know them and spoke to them harshly: &amp;apos;Where do you come from?&amp;apos; &amp;apos;From the land of Canaan,&amp;apos; they answered, &amp;apos;and we&amp;quot;re here to buy food.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Although Joseph recognized his brothers, they had no clue that it was Joseph speaking to them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Then at once, Joseph remembered the dreams he had about them bowing down before him ! Pausing , he said to them, &amp;apos;You are spies! You&amp;quot;ve come to see where our land is weak!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">His brothers replied, &amp;apos;No, master; we&amp;quot;ve come to buy food.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">We, your servants, are honest men; we&amp;quot;d never think of spying! We&amp;quot;re blood brothers, sons of one father.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Joseph interrupted, &amp;apos;No! You are spies who have come here to find our weakness!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">&amp;apos;We are your servants,&amp;apos; they insisted. &amp;apos;We were twelve brothers, our youngest brother remained behind with our father, and one brother&amp;ndash;well, he is no more.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Joseph said to them, &amp;apos;It&amp;quot;s just as I said; you are spies!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">And here is how I&amp;quot;ll test you: unless your younger brother comes and presents himself here before me , then as surely as Pharaoh lives, you shall not depart from here!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">One of you must go and bring me your brother, while the rest of you will remain here in confinement. This way I will test your words to see if the story you have told me is true. If not, as surely as Pharaoh lives, you are spies!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">He placed them all in prison together for three days.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">On the third day, Joseph said to them, &amp;apos;Do as I say and you will live. I am a man who respects God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">If you are as honest as you say you are, then I will keep just one of your brothers here in confinement while the rest of you carry grain home for your starving families.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">You must return with your youngest brother so that I may verify your story, and that you may not die.&amp;apos; So they agreed to do so.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">With Joseph standing there , they began to speak among themselves, saying, &amp;apos; Look what&amp;quot;s happened to us! We&amp;quot;re being punished for what we did to Joseph long ago. We heard his cries of anguish and saw the agony of his soul when he begged us for mercy, but we turned a deaf ear. That&amp;quot;s why all this trouble has come upon us!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Then Reuben spoke up, &amp;apos;Didn&amp;quot;t I tell you not to sin against the boy? But you wouldn&amp;quot;t listen! So now we&amp;quot;re paying the price for his murder!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">They had no clue that Joseph understood every word, for he had been speaking to them through an interpreter.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">Deeply affected by what he heard , Joseph began to weep and hurriedly left their presence. After he had composed himself , he returned to them, and pointing to Simeon, said, &amp;apos;This one will remain here.&amp;apos; Then he had him tied and bound while they all watched.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">Joseph then gave orders to have their bags filled with grain, to hide each man&amp;quot;s money back inside his sack, and to give them provisions for their journey home. After this was done for them,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">they loaded their donkeys with the bags of grain and departed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">Later, they camped for the night, and as one of them opened his sack of grain to feed his donkey, he discovered that his money was there right on top of the grain!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">He shouted to his brothers, &amp;apos;My money! Look, someone put my money back in my sack!&amp;apos; Troubled and trembling, they said to each other, &amp;apos;What in the world has God done to us?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">When they came to their father Jacob in Canaan, they told him the story of all that happened to them, saying,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">&amp;apos;The governor of Egypt spoke harshly to us and accused us of being spies.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">We told him, &amp;quot;We are not spies but honest men.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">We&amp;quot;re twelve brothers, sons of our father. Our youngest remained with our father in the land of Canaan, and one is no more.&amp;quot;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">Then the man, the governor of Egypt, demanded, &amp;quot;By this test, I will discern if you are honest men: Leave one of your brothers with me, take the grain you need for your families, and be on your way.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">Return to me with your youngest brother, then I&amp;quot;ll know you are not spies, but men of integrity. Then I&amp;quot;ll release your brother back to you, and you&amp;quot;ll be free to trade in the land.&amp;quot; &amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">As they each emptied their sacks of grain, each man found his money inside his sack! When they and their father saw their money returned to them, they were frightened.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">Their father Jacob said to his sons, &amp;apos;You have taken away my children! First, Joseph is gone, and now, Simeon! And now, you want to take Benjamin from me! Everything is against me!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">Then Reuben said, &amp;apos; Father , you may put my two sons to death if I fail to bring Benjamin back to you! Trust me&amp;ndash;I will bring him back!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">But Jacob replied, &amp;apos;I can&amp;quot;t let my son Benjamin go with you. For his brother is dead, and of Rachel&amp;quot;s sons , he alone is left. If he were to meet with disaster on your journey, I would die of grief ! You will send my white hair and broken heart sorrowing down to the grave!&amp;apos;</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="43">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Now the famine in the land continued to grow more severe.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">When all the grain they had brought from Egypt was almost gone, their father said to them, &amp;apos;Go back and buy us more food.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">But Judah objected, &amp;apos;The Egyptian warned us repeatedly, &amp;quot;You will not see my face again, unless Benjamin is with you!&amp;quot;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">We&amp;quot;ll only go if you&amp;quot;ll let our brother come with us.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">If you insist he remains here, we won&amp;quot;t go, for the man solemnly told us, &amp;quot;You will not see my face again, unless your brother is with you!&amp;quot; &amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Israel demanded, &amp;apos;Why did you make it so hard for me by telling the man you had another brother?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">They answered him, &amp;apos;The man interrogated us about ourselves and our family, saying, &amp;quot;Is your father still living? Do you have another brother?&amp;quot; We had to answer his questions! We had no idea he would say, &amp;quot;You must bring your brother here to me.&amp;quot; &amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">And besides, if we hadn&amp;quot;t delayed so long, we could have gone and returned twice by now!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">After considering their words , their father Israel said to them, &amp;apos;If that&amp;quot;s the way it has to be, then do this: Load your donkeys with the very best gifts you can find, choice products of the land, and offer them to the man. Take some balm and some honey, spices, and myrrh, pistachio nuts and almonds.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Take double the money with you. Give him back the money that was returned in the top of your sacks, for it may have been a mistake.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Take your brother, too, and be off! Go back to the man at once.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">May the God who is more than enough grant you mercy and favor before the man, so that he may send back both Simeon and Benjamin. As for me, if I suffer loss, then let it be so.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">So the brothers set off for Egypt and took double the money, the many gifts, and Benjamin. Once they arrived, they presented themselves before Joseph.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">When Joseph saw his brother Benjamin with them, he said to his chief servant, &amp;apos;Bring the men to my house and make them feel at home . Butcher an animal and prepare a meal, for these men are to dine with me at noon.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Joseph&amp;quot;s chief servant did as he was told and brought the men to Joseph&amp;quot;s house.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Now the brothers were very apprehensive as they were being led inside, and said to each other, &amp;apos;He brought us here because of the money that was put back in our sacks the first time we came to Egypt! He&amp;quot;s looking for an opportunity to arrest us, turn us into his slaves, and take away our donkeys!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">So they approached the chief servant and spoke to him at the entrance of the house.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">&amp;apos;If you please, my lord,&amp;apos; they said, &amp;apos;we came here once before to buy food,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">&amp;apos;Relax,&amp;apos; he replied, &amp;apos;don&amp;quot;t be afraid. Your God, the God of your father, must have been the one who put treasure in your bags. I have received your money; it&amp;quot;s all accounted for .&amp;apos; Then the chief servant brought Simeon out to them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">Then he gave feed to their donkeys and brought the brothers into the house. He gave them water to drink and washed their feet.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">The men laid out their gifts to present to Joseph, for they were told he would appear before them at noon and would dine with them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">When Joseph came home, they presented to him the gifts they had brought with them into the house. They each bowed low before him with their faces to the ground.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">He asked them how the family was doing, saying, &amp;apos;You mentioned your aging father; is he still alive? Is he doing well?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">&amp;apos;Yes,&amp;apos; they replied, &amp;apos;our father, your servant, is still alive and doing well.&amp;apos; And they bowed low before Joseph in respect.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">Looking them over, he saw his brother Benjamin, his mother&amp;quot;s son, and said to them, &amp;apos;So, I see you have returned with your youngest brother, of whom you spoke. God be gracious to you, my son.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">Joseph hastily left the room, for he was overwhelmed with feelings of love for his brother and on the verge of tears. He went into a private room and sobbed, as tears ran down his cheeks.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">When he finally composed himself, he washed his face, reappeared, and ordered: &amp;apos;Serve the meal.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">First, they served Joseph who was seated apart from his brothers, then the brothers by themselves, and the Egyptians by themselves. (It would have been utterly offensive for the Egyptians to eat at the same table with the Hebrews.)</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">Now, the brothers had been seated before Joseph in their birth order, from the firstborn at one end of the table to the youngest at the other end. They were all stunned when they realized the seating arrangement and looked at each other in astonishment.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">Eleven plates of food were taken from Joseph&amp;quot;s table and set in front of each of them, but Benjamin&amp;quot;s portion was five times more than any of theirs! They feasted and drank their fill with Joseph until they all became drunk.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="44">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Joseph ordered his chief servant, &amp;apos;Fill the men&amp;quot;s sacks with grain, with as much as they can hold, and put each one&amp;quot;s money back in the mouth of his bag.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">As for the youngest one, place my silver goblet in the mouth of his sack, along with the money he paid for his grain.&amp;apos; And he did as Joseph said.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">At dawn, the men loaded their donkeys and set off for home.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">They hadn&amp;quot;t gone far outside of the city when Joseph said to his chief servant, &amp;apos;Now, go at once and pursue the men! And when you catch up to them, say to them, &amp;quot;Why did you repay good with evil?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Why have you stolen the silver goblet from which my master drinks, and the one he uses to discover secrets hidden from men? You have done an evil thing!&amp;quot; &amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">When the chief servant caught up with them, he repeated his master&amp;quot;s words to them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">They answered him, &amp;apos;Why does my lord accuse us of such things? Far be it from your servants to do anything of the kind!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Didn&amp;quot;t we return from Canaan with the money we found in our grain sacks? Why then would we steal silver or gold from the house of your lord?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Look for yourself. If any of your servants is found to have it, then he will die, and the rest of us will become your master&amp;quot;s slaves!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">&amp;apos;Very well then,&amp;apos; Joseph&amp;quot;s servant replied, &amp;apos;as you have said. But I will show you leniency . The one who has it will be my slave, but the rest of you will go free.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Each one quickly lowered his bag to the ground and opened it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Then the chief servant searched each bag, beginning with oldest and ending with the youngest&amp;ndash;and he found the silver goblet in Benjamin&amp;quot;s bag!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Aghast , the brothers ripped their clothes in despair. They all loaded their donkeys again and returned to the city.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Joseph was waiting in his house when Judah and his brothers arrived. When they saw Joseph, they all fell to the ground before him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Joseph said to them, &amp;apos;What have you done? Don&amp;quot;t you know that divination would have given insight to a man like me?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Judah replied, &amp;apos;What can we say, my lord? How can we plead our case? How can we prove our innocence? God has revealed the guilt of your servants, and here we are&amp;ndash;our lord&amp;quot;s slaves, both we and the one in whose sack the silver goblet was found.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">&amp;apos;No,&amp;apos; Joseph commanded. &amp;apos;Only the one who stole my silver goblet will be my slave; the rest of you will go on home in peace to your father.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Then Judah stepped forward and offered, &amp;apos;My lord, please, may I have a word with you? You are the equal of Pharaoh. Please don&amp;quot;t be angry with me, your servant.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">My lord asked his servants, &amp;quot;Do you have a father or another brother?&amp;quot;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">We answered my lord, &amp;quot;We have an aged father and our youngest brother, who is a child of his old age. The child&amp;quot;s full brother is dead, so now he is the only child left of his mother, and his father loves him very much.&amp;quot;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Then you said to your servants, &amp;quot;Bring him here to me so that I might see him myself.&amp;quot;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">We said to my lord, &amp;quot;But he cannot leave his father; if he were to leave him, his father would die.&amp;quot;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">Then you said to your servants, &amp;quot;You will not see my face again if I do not see your youngest brother.&amp;quot;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">When we arrived home to your servant, my father, we told him every word you had spoken to us.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">&amp;apos;Sometime later, our father said to us, &amp;quot;Go back and buy some more food for us.&amp;quot;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">We answered, &amp;quot;We can only return to Egypt if we take our youngest brother with us. We won&amp;quot;t see the man&amp;quot;s face again, if he doesn&amp;quot;t see our youngest brother.&amp;quot;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">Then, your servant, my father, said to us, &amp;quot;You know that my wife Rachel only gave me two sons.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">One is gone from me&amp;ndash;torn by a beast! I haven&amp;quot;t seen him since.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">If you take this one also from me, and something happens to him, you will send my gray hairs in grief down to the grave.&amp;quot; &amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">Furthermore, I, your servant, have guaranteed the boy&amp;quot;s safety to my father. I told him, &amp;quot;If I don&amp;quot;t return the boy back to you, I will bear the blame before you, my father, for the rest of my life!&amp;quot;</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="45">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Joseph could no longer contain his pent-up feelings, so he cried out to his attendants, &amp;apos;Leave the room!&amp;apos; So no one was there when Joseph revealed his identity to his brothers.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">He began to weep so loudly that the Egyptians heard it&amp;ndash;even as far away as Pharaoh&amp;quot;s house!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Joseph, through his tears , said to his brothers in Hebrew : &amp;apos;I am Joseph! Is father still alive?&amp;apos; His brothers stood there stunned, scared, and speechless.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Joseph said to his brothers, &amp;apos;Please, come close to me.&amp;apos; Inching forward, they came close to him. Then Joseph said, &amp;apos;It&amp;quot;s me&amp;ndash;your brother&amp;ndash;whom you sold into slavery in Egypt. I am Joseph!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Now don&amp;quot;t be grieved. Don&amp;quot;t blame yourselves because you sold me here. It was God who sent me ahead of you in order to save lives.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">The famine has now endured for two years, and the land will not bear fruit for five more years.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">God sent me ahead of you to ensure that you would live and have descendants . He has saved your lives through this marvelous act of deliverance.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">So it was God, not you, who sent me here. God has made me a father to Pharaoh, the master of his entire household, and the ruler over all of Egypt.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">&amp;apos;Hurry back to my father and tell him that you have found me alive . Tell him, &amp;quot;This is what your son Joseph says, &amp;apos;God has made me ruler of all Egypt. Come to me without delay.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">You will settle in the land of Goshen, where you will be near me&amp;ndash;you and all your children and your grandchildren, your flocks and herds and all that you possess.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">For there will be five more years of famine, but I will provide all that you need to live in Goshen. You, your household, and all that you have will not live in poverty.&amp;apos; &amp;quot;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">&amp;apos;My brothers, you each can see for yourselves, and Benjamin can too, that I really am Joseph, for I&amp;quot;m speaking to you face-to-face in our own language.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">You must tell father everything you have seen here and how greatly I am honored in Egypt. But hurry and bring my father here to me.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Then Joseph threw his arms around Benjamin&amp;quot;s neck, sobbing, and Benjamin wept on Joseph&amp;quot;s neck.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">With tears streaming down his face, Joseph kissed each brother, one by one. After their tearful, emotional embrace , they took time to speak brother-to-brother.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">The news reached Pharaoh&amp;quot;s house: &amp;apos;Joseph&amp;quot;s brothers have come.&amp;apos; Pharaoh and his officials were greatly pleased when they heard it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Pharaoh said to Joseph, &amp;apos;Tell your brothers: &amp;quot;Load your donkeys and return to Canaan.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="21">Israel&amp;quot;s sons did as they were instructed. Joseph gave them wagons, as the king had ordered, and provided food for their journey.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">He gave each of them a set of garments, and to Benjamin he also gave three hundred pieces of silver and five sets of garments.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">He sent his father ten donkeys loaded with the best Egyptian goods and ten female donkeys loaded with grain, bread, and other provisions for the journey.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="4">&amp;apos;We have come to stay as temporary residents in this country, because in the land of Canaan, the famine is so severe that there is no pasture for your servants&amp;quot; flocks. Please give us permission to settle in the land of Goshen.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Pharaoh said to Joseph, &amp;apos;Now that your father and your brothers have arrived,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">the land of Egypt is theirs. Let them settle in the best part of the land, in the region of Goshen. And if there are any competent men among them, put them in charge of my own livestock.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Later, Joseph brought Jacob into the house and presented him before Pharaoh. And Jacob gave Pharaoh a blessing.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Pharaoh asked Jacob, &amp;apos;How old are you?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Jacob answered, &amp;apos;My earthly journey has been one hundred and thirty years. My years have been few and hard, but it doesn&amp;quot;t compare to the length of the earthly journeys of my fathers.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Then Jacob blessed Pharaoh again and departed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">So Joseph settled his father and brothers in the choicest part of the land of Egypt, in the district of Rameses, as Pharaoh had commanded.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Joseph also provided his father and brothers and their families, down to their little ones, with all the food they needed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Now there was no food anywhere, for the famine was very severe. Both the land of Egypt and the land of Canaan languished because of the famine.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">And the people of Egypt and Canaan spent all their money to buy grain. Joseph gathered all the money from the sale of grain and deposited the wealth into Pharaoh&amp;quot;s treasury.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">When the money ran out in Egypt and Canaan, all the Egyptians came to Joseph and pleaded with him, &amp;apos;All our money is gone; give us food! Why would you let us die in front of your eyes?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Joseph answered, &amp;apos;If your money is gone, then give me your livestock. I will give you food in exchange for your livestock.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">So in that year, they brought their livestock to Joseph&amp;ndash;their horses, sheep, cattle, and donkeys&amp;ndash;and he supplied them with food in exchange for their livestock.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">The next year, they came to him and said, &amp;apos;Master, it&amp;quot;s no secret to you that we are broke. All our silver and livestock are now yours. We have nothing left but ourselves and our lands.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Why would you let us die in front of your eyes, leaving all our lands uninhabited? Buy us and our lands in exchange for food. We&amp;quot;ll become Pharaoh&amp;quot;s slaves and give up our land. Only give us seed so that we may live and not die and so that the land will not become a desert.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">So Joseph gained possession of all the farmland in Egypt for Pharaoh. Every Egyptian sold his land in exchange for food , for the famine was that severe. Eventually, the Egyptians had transferred all the land to Pharaoh.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Everyone became a slave to Pharaoh, from one end of Egypt to the other.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">However, he did not take over the land of the priests, for they received royal subsidies from Pharaoh. They lived on the food he provided for them, and that is why they did not have to sell their land.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">Joseph said to the people, &amp;apos;Today I have acquired for Pharaoh you and all your land. Here is seed for you to sow in the land.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">But when harvest comes, you must pay one-fifth to Pharaoh, and you may keep the rest for planting your fields and for food for yourselves and your families to nourish your household and your little ones.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">&amp;apos;You have saved our lives!&amp;apos; they said. &amp;apos;May we find your favor, our lord, and we will be slaves to Pharaoh.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">Thus, Joseph established the law of the land in Egypt, which is still in effect, &amp;apos;A fifth will go to Pharaoh.&amp;apos; Only the land of the priests did not become Pharaoh&amp;quot;s.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">Israel and his descendants settled in Egypt in the land of Goshen. They had many children and multiplied, and they acquired property.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">Jacob lived in Egypt for seventeen years and lived a total of one hundred and forty-seven years.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">When the time of Israel&amp;quot;s death was near, he summoned his beloved son Joseph and said to him, &amp;apos; Son , do me this favor before I die : Place your hand under my thigh as a pledge that you will show me kindness and loyal love. Do not bury me in Egypt,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">but when I go to rest with my fathers, I want you to carry me out of Egypt and bury me where they are buried.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">Swear that you will do this.&amp;apos; Then Israel worshiped and leaned on the top of his staff.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="48">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Not long afterward, Joseph received the news that his father&amp;quot;s health was failing, so he took his two sons Manasseh and Ephraim along with him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">When Jacob heard that they had come to see him, Israel rallied his strength and sat up in bed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Jacob said to Joseph, &amp;apos;The God who is more than enough appeared to me at Bethel in the land of Canaan where he blessed me!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">He said to me, &amp;quot;I will make you fruitful and multiply your descendants until I have made you a company of nations. And I will give this land to your descendants for an everlasting possession.&amp;quot;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Furthermore, I will adopt as my very own your two sons who were born in the land of Egypt before I came here. Yes , I claim Ephraim and Manasseh as mine, no less than my two oldest , Reuben and Simeon.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">As for any children born after them, they will be considered yours. They will receive their portion of the inheritance in the same territory as their brothers.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">For when I was returning from Paddan-Aram, my beloved Rachel died, to my sorrow, in the land of Canaan while we were still on our way, not far from Ephrath. So I buried her there beside the road to Ephrath (that is, Bethlehem).&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">When Israel noticed Joseph&amp;quot;s two sons, he said, &amp;apos;Who are these?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">&amp;apos;They are the sons that God has graciously given me here,&amp;apos; Joseph said to his father. &amp;apos;Please bring them closer,&amp;apos; he said, &amp;apos;so that I may bless them.&amp;apos; &amp;apos;May the God of my fathers, Abraham and Isaac, who lived devoted to him, the God who has been my Shepherd from my birth until this day, may he bless these boys! May their lives echo my name, and the names of my fathers Abraham and Isaac. May they multiply into teeming multitudes throughout the earth!&amp;apos; &amp;apos;Israel will use your names when they pronounce blessings! So the crossing of his arms during Jacob&amp;quot;s blessing put Ephraim ahead of Manasseh.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Now Israel could barely see, for his eyes were failing because of old age. So, Joseph brought his sons closer to him, and Joseph&amp;quot;s father, their grandfather , hugged and kissed them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Tearfully , Israel said to Joseph, &amp;apos;I never thought I&amp;quot;d see your face again, and now, God has let me see my grandchildren as well!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Joseph then removed them from his father&amp;quot;s knees and bowed low in respect before his father with his face to the ground.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">And Joseph took his sons and had them stand facing their grandfather Israel, Ephraim at Israel&amp;quot;s left hand, and Manasseh at Israel&amp;quot;s right hand.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">But Israel crossed his arms, and stretched out his right hand on the head of the younger son, Ephraim, and his left hand on the head of the firstborn son, Manasseh.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">He spoke this blessing over them:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">the Angel who has delivered me from all harm,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">When Joseph saw his father place his right hand on Ephraim&amp;quot;s head, he was not happy, so he tried to move his father&amp;quot;s hand from Ephraim to Manasseh&amp;quot;s head.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">&amp;apos;Not that way,&amp;apos; Joseph said to his father, &amp;apos;Here, father, put your right hand on the firstborn&amp;quot;s head.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">But his father refused and said, &amp;apos;I know, my son, I know. Manasseh&amp;quot;s descendants will also multiply and become a great people. His younger brother will become even greater than he, and his tribe will one day give rise to many nations.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">So Jacob blessed them that day, saying, They will say, &amp;quot;May God make you like Ephraim and like Manasseh!&amp;quot; &amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Then Israel said to Joseph, &amp;apos;Son, I will die soon, but God&amp;quot;s presence will go with you, and one day, he will take you back to the land of your ancestors.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">I give you one mountain slope more than your brothers, the mountain slope of Shechem, the fertile region I took from the Amorites with my own sword and my own bow.&amp;apos;</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="49">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Jacob called all his sons together and gathered them around his bedside. He said to them, &amp;apos;Let me prophesy to you about your future destinies :</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">&amp;apos;Come together and listen to me, O sons of Jacob, Listen to your father Israel. for you have slept with my concubine and defiled yourself in your father&amp;quot;s bed! and for pleasure, they maimed an ox. and scatter them throughout Israel.

			<VERS vnumber="3">&amp;apos;Reuben, my firstborn, you are my strength and the firstfruits of my manhood. You are preeminent in pride and surpassing others in power. you will no longer excel, for your swords have committed violent acts. O my heart, never let me be counted in their assembly, for they killed men in fits of rage, and their wrath so relentless. I will divide your descendants throughout Jacob&amp;quot;s territory And your father&amp;quot;s sons will bow down before you. who has devoured its prey and departed. Like a lion, he crouches and lies down, nor the ruler&amp;quot;s staff from his descendants, and takes what is due him, for the obedience of nations belongs to him. and his purebred colt to the choicest branch. He will wash his garments in wine and become a safe harbor for ships, then he will bend his shoulder to the burden as one of the tribes of Israel. like a snake in the grass. He bites the horse&amp;quot;s heels, the God who is more than enough will bless you. He will bless you with the blessings of heaven, blessings of the deep that lie beneath, and blessings of the breast and womb. than the blessings of the eternal mountains, May Joseph&amp;quot;s blessings crown his head prince among his brothers. He devours his prey;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">You are unstable&amp;ndash;as turbulent as floodwaters;</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="28">All these men became the twelve tribes of Israel. These were prophetic words their father spoke to them when he blessed them, blessing each son with a parting word appropriate to him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">Afterward, Jacob sat on the side of his bed and instructed his sons with these words: &amp;apos;I am about to join my people in death . Bury me with my ancestors in the cave of the field of Ephron the Hittite&amp;ndash;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">the cave in the field of Machpelah, near Mamre, in the land of Canaan. My grandfather Abraham purchased that field as a burial site from Ephron the Hittite.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="32">So, bury me there , in that cave, in the field that was purchased from the Hittites.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">When Jacob finished his final words of instruction to his sons, he lifted his feet onto the bed, breathed his last, and was gathered to his people.</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="50">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Joseph flung himself over Jacob, kissing him and weeping. And his tears fell on his father&amp;quot;s face.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">and when the weeping period was over, Joseph approached Pharaoh&amp;quot;s officials and said to them, &amp;apos;Please, may I ask a personal favor? Bring my appeal before Pharaoh and tell him:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">&amp;quot;My dying father made me promise that I would bury him in the land of Canaan&amp;ndash;in a tomb he had hewn with his own hands. Please give me permission to go and bury my father; then I will return.&amp;quot; &amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Pharaoh said to Joseph, &amp;apos;Go to Canaan, bury your father, and keep your promise to him.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">So Joseph went to Canaan to bury his father, and all the officials of Pharaoh, the elite members of his court, and all of Egypt&amp;quot;s dignitaries accompanied him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">All of Joseph&amp;quot;s household and all his brothers and their father&amp;quot;s household went, too. Only the children and livestock remained behind in Goshen.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Many chariots and horsemen&amp;ndash;a huge entourage&amp;ndash;accompanied Joseph to Canaan in a grand procession!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">When they arrived at the threshing floor of Atad on the other side of the Jordan, they mourned loudly with bitter sorrow for a long time. And Joseph spent seven days there in ceremonial mourning for his father.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">When the people of Canaan saw the depth of mourning at the threshing floor of Atad, they said, &amp;apos;This is a solemn occasion of grief for the Egyptians,&amp;apos; and named the place near the Jordan, The Mourning of the Egyptians.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">So Jacob&amp;quot;s sons did as they were instructed</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">and carried his body to the land of Canaan. They buried him there in the cave in the field of Machpelah near Mamre, where Abraham had purchased a burial place from Ephron the Hittite.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">After burying his father, Joseph returned to Egypt with his brothers and all who had gone with him to bury his father.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">When the brothers realized they were now without their father, they said, &amp;apos;What if Joseph still bears a grudge against us and decides to pay us back for all the trouble we brought on him?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">So they sent this message to Joseph: &amp;apos;Before he died, your father left us this instruction:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">&amp;quot;Tell Joseph that I beg him to completely forgive the sin of his brothers who treated him so harshly.&amp;quot; Now, please forgive us, servants of the God of your father, of the horrible wrong we did to you.&amp;apos; Joseph cried and wept as they read this message to him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Then his brothers came and threw themselves down before Joseph&amp;quot;s feet, saying, &amp;apos;We are here as your slaves!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">But Joseph dried his tears and said, &amp;apos;Don&amp;quot;t be afraid. How could I ever take the place of God?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Even though you intended to hurt me, God intended it for good. It was his plan all along , to ensure the survival of many people. So, don&amp;quot;t worry. I myself will provide for you all that you need, both for you and your little ones.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Then with more kind, reassuring words, Joseph comforted his brothers.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Joseph lived in Egypt along with his father&amp;quot;s family and lived to be one hundred and ten years old.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">He lived to see the third generation of Ephraim&amp;quot;s children. Joseph also lived to see the children of Makir, son of Manasseh; and Joseph gave Makir&amp;quot;s children inheritance rights.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">Then Joseph declared to his brothers, &amp;apos;I will die one day, but God will certainly come to you and fulfill his promises to bring you and your descendants from this land and lead you to the land he promised to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">So Joseph had his brothers, the sons of Israel, make a solemn oath, saying, &amp;apos;When God comes to you, you will carry my bones up from Egypt.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">Joseph died at the age of one hundred and ten. He was embalmed and placed in a coffin in Egypt.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1">And after Moses, Yahweh &amp;quot;s servant, died, Yahweh spoke to Joshua son of Nun, Moses&amp;quot; faithful assistant, and said,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">&amp;apos;My servant Moses is dead. Now get up! Prepare to cross the Jordan River, you and all the people. Lead them into the land that I am giving to the Israelites.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Every part of the land where you march I will give you, as I promised Moses.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Your borders will extend from the southern desert to the northern mountains of Lebanon, and from the great river Euphrates in the east , to the Mediterranean in the west&amp;ndash;including all the land of the Hittites.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Joshua, no one will be able to defeat you for the rest of your life! I will be with you as I was with Moses, and I will never fail nor abandon you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">You must be strong and brave. You will lead the people to acquire and apportion the land that I promised their ancestors I would give them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">You must remain very strong and courageous! Be faithful to obey all the teaching that my servant Moses commanded you to follow. Do not deviate from him to the right or to the left, so that you will have overwhelming success in everything you undertake.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Recite this scroll of the law constantly. Contemplate it day and night and be careful to follow every word it contains; then you will enjoy incredible prosperity and success.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">I repeat, be strong and brave! Do not yield to fear nor be discouraged, for I am Yahweh your God, and I will be with you wherever you go!&amp;apos;</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="15">until they take possession of the land that Yahweh your God is giving them as their homeland. Afterward, you will be free to return to your own land and possess the land that Moses, Yahweh &amp;quot;s servant, gave you here on the east side of the Jordan.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">They answered Joshua: &amp;apos;We will do everything you have told us and will go wherever you send us.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1">Then Joshua son of Nun secretly sent out two spies from their camp at Acacia. He told them, &amp;apos;Go and explore the land of Canaan, especially Jericho.&amp;apos; They went and arrived at Jericho and entered the house of Rahab the prostitute and lodged there.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">The king of Jericho was told: &amp;apos;Some Israelites have come into the city tonight to spy out the entire land. They&amp;quot;re in Rahab&amp;quot;s house .&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">So the king sent messengers to Rahab, who said to her: &amp;apos;Turn over the men who entered your house. They&amp;quot;re here to spy out our land.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">But Rahab had already hidden the two men. &amp;apos;Yes,&amp;apos; she said. &amp;apos;The men came to me, but I had no idea where they were from.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">They left at sundown, just before the city gates were closed at night. Who knows where they went. Quick! Go after them, and maybe you can catch them!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">(Rahab had hidden the men on her rooftop under stalks of flax she had spread out to dry on the roof.)</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">So the men of Jericho went out to search for the spies, and the city gates were shut behind them. They searched for them as far as where the path crosses the Jordan.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Before the spies had gone to sleep, Rahab went up to the rooftop</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">and said to them, &amp;apos;I know that Yahweh has given you this land. Everyone is absolutely terrified, and we are all paralyzed with fear because of you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">We&amp;quot;ve heard of the miracles that accompany you and how Yahweh dried up the waters of the Red Sea for you when you left Egypt.

			<VERS vnumber="11">As soon as we heard it, our hearts melted with fear, and we were left with no courage among us because of you. Yahweh , your God, is the true God who rules in heaven above and on earth below.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="15">Rahab&amp;quot;s house was built into the city wall, so she let them down from the window by a rope.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">She told them, &amp;apos;Head for the hill country and hide. The men chasing you won&amp;quot;t find you there. Hide for three days until they have returned, then you&amp;quot;ll be safe to go your way.&amp;apos;</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="18">When our invasion begins, bring all your family together in your house&amp;ndash;your father and mother, your brothers and sisters, and all their families. And tie this crimson rope in the same window through which you let us down.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Remember, if anyone ventures outside your house, his death will be his own fault, not ours! But if anyone inside your house is harmed, then we will be held responsible.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">And if you disclose our mission, we will be released from the oath you made us swear.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Rahab replied in agreement, &amp;apos;Let it be as you say.&amp;apos; And she sent them away, and after they departed, she tied the crimson rope in her window.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">The spies went straight to the hill country and hid there for three days, until the pursuers turned back. The king&amp;quot;s men had scoured the countryside without finding them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">Then the two men came down from the hills and crossed back over the Jordan to their camp . They reported to Joshua son of Nun all that had happened to them:</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1">Joshua was up bright and early the next morning. They broke camp, and Joshua led the Israelites from Acacia to the eastern bank of the Jordan. There they set up camp and waited until they crossed over.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">After three days, the leaders of the people went throughout the camp</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">giving orders to the people, &amp;apos;Watch for the priests of the tribe of Levi to lift the ark of the covenant of Yahweh your God. When it starts moving, follow it</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="10">This is how you will know for sure that the Living God is among you. As you advance into the land , he will drive out before you the Canaanites, Hittites, Hivites, Perizzites, Girgashites, Amorites, and Jebusites.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Look! The ark of the covenant of the Lord of all the earth will go before you and prepare a way for you through the Jordan.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Now select twelve men from among the people, one man from each tribe.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">&amp;apos;The moment the feet of the priests carrying the ark of Yahweh , the Lord of all the earth, touch the water of the Jordan, a great miracle will happen ! The water flowing downstream toward you will stop and pile up as if behind a dam.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">the water coming downstream toward them stopped flowing and piled up in a solid wall as far upstream as Adam, a place near Zarethan. Yahweh completely cut off the flow of the river so that it drained downstream toward the Desert Sea (the Dead Sea). So the people crossed over opposite Jericho.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Now the priests stood firmly on dry ground in the riverbed with the ark on their shoulders . The entire nation passed by the ark as they completed their miracle -crossing on dry ground.</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="4">
			<VERS vnumber="1">When the entire nation had finished their miracle-crossing of the Jordan, Yahweh said to Joshua,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">&amp;apos;Choose twelve men, one from each of the twelve tribes of Israel.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Instruct each of them to take a stone from the riverbed, twelve stones from the very place where the priests stand with the ark . Have them carry the stones over to the place where you camp tonight.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">So Joshua summoned the twelve men he had selected from the Israelites, one per tribe.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Joshua instructed them, &amp;apos;Walk out to the middle of the riverbed to the ark of Yahweh your God. Each of you choose a stone and lift it up onto your shoulder&amp;ndash;one stone for each tribe.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">The stones will always be a sign to you. Someday, when your children ask you, &amp;quot;Why are these stones so important?&amp;quot;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">tell them, &amp;quot;The Jordan stopped flowing in front of the ark of the covenant of Yahweh &amp;ndash;the floodwaters were completely cut off.&amp;quot; These stones will serve as a memorial for Israel forever.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">The Israelites did as Joshua commanded them. They took twelve stones according to the number of the tribes of Israel, from the middle of the riverbed, and carried them to the camp and put them there.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Joshua set up the memorial stones that they had taken from the exact spot where the priests stood bearing the ark in the riverbed. They remain there to this day.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">While the priests remained standing in the middle of the Jordan with the ark on their shoulders , the people hurried across. All the instructions Yahweh had given to Joshua were carried out &amp;ndash;just as Moses had told Joshua.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">And when Israel had finished crossing, the ark of Yahweh and the priests crossed as the people looked on.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">The Reubenites, the Gadites, and half the tribe of Manasseh went across, armed and ready for battle, in front of the Israelites, as Moses had commanded them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">In all, about forty thousand men were equipped for battle. And they all marched before Yahweh to wage war on the plains of Jericho.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">On that day, Yahweh exalted Joshua before all the people. As they had stood in awe of Moses, so they stood in awe of Joshua for the rest of his life.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Yahweh said to Joshua,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">&amp;apos;Command the priests carrying the ark of the covenant to come up from the Jordan.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">So Joshua did as he was commanded,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">and the priests carrying the ark of the covenant of Yahweh came up from the riverbed. And the moment their feet touched the western bank of the Jordan, the floodwaters surged back in place where they were before and returned to flood stage.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">The people experienced the miracle-crossing of the Jordan on the tenth day of the first month of the Jewish calendar . They established their base camp at Gilgal, east of Jericho,</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="21">He told the Israelites, &amp;apos;In time to come, when children ask their fathers, &amp;quot;Why are these stones so important?&amp;quot;</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="5">
			<VERS vnumber="1">All the Amorite kings west of the Jordan and all the Canaanite kings along the coast of the Mediterranean Sea became terrified of the Israelites. For when they heard how Yahweh miraculously dried up the Jordan so that the Israelites could cross over, all their courage melted away.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">At that time, Yahweh commanded Joshua, &amp;apos;Make knives of flint and circumcise the men of Israel again.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">So Joshua made stone knives and circumcised all the men at a place they named Circumcision Hill.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">So he raised up their sons in their place, and Joshua circumcised them because they had not been circumcised on the way.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">After the circumcision was completed, the whole nation waited in the camp until their wounds had healed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Then Yahweh said to Joshua, &amp;apos;Today, I have rolled away your disgrace from being slaves in Egypt.&amp;apos; For that reason, the place is named Gilgal to this day.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">While encamped at Gilgal, not far from Jericho, the Israelites celebrated the Feast of Passover in the evening of the fourteenth day of the month of Abib .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">The very next day, they ate for the first time food grown in Canaan&amp;ndash;roasted grain and flatbread made without yeast.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">On that day, when they ate the produce of the land, the manna stopped falling from heaven . The Israelites never ate manna again, but that year they enjoyed the fruit of the land of Canaan.</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="6">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Now the gates of Jericho were bolted and barred because of the Israelites; no one could get in or out.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="5">When you hear the blare of the shofars, have all the people shout with a mighty shout of joy! Then the walls of the city will collapse before your eyes , and your whole army must charge straight in!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">So Joshua son of Nun summoned the priests and instructed them: &amp;apos;Take up the ark of the covenant, and have seven priests carry seven shofars in front of the ark of Yahweh .&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">And to the people he said, &amp;apos;Forward! March around the city and set an advance guard of armed men to march ahead of the ark of Yahweh .&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">At Joshua&amp;quot;s order, the seven priests carrying seven shofars advanced before Yahweh . The ark of the covenant of Yahweh followed them as they made long blasts on their shofars.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">The advance guard marched in front of the priests who were blowing the shofars, the rear guard marched behind the ark, and the shofars blared the whole time!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Now Joshua had commanded the rest of the people, &amp;apos;Do not shout! Remain silent! Don&amp;quot;t make a sound until the moment I command you to shout. Then lift up a shout with all your might !&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">So the ark of Yahweh circled the city once, then they all came back to the camp in Gilgal and spent the night.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Joshua rose bright and early the next morning, and the priests took up the ark of Yahweh .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">The armed men and the seven priests carrying the seven shofars marched in front of the ark of Yahweh blowing their shofars continually, and the rear guard followed the ark of Yahweh , while the trumpets kept sounding.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">On the second day, they circled the city once and again returned to the camp. They repeated this pattern for six days.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">On the seventh day, everyone rose at daybreak, and they marched around the city in the same manner seven times.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">After their seventh time around, when the priests were about to blow the shofars, Joshua commanded the people: &amp;apos;Shout a shout of joy ! Yahweh has given you the city!</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="21">They utterly destroyed all that was in Jericho, men and women, young and old, livestock and donkeys&amp;ndash;everything was destroyed with the sword.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="23">So the two spies brought out Rahab, her father, mother, brothers and sisters, and all who belonged to her, and gave them refuge outside the camp of Israel.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">Then they burned Jericho to the ground and all that was within it. Only the silver and gold, brass, and iron were placed into the treasury of Yahweh &amp;quot;s house.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">Yet Joshua spared Rahab the prostitute, her father&amp;quot;s family, and all that belonged to her. She lives among the Israelites to this day because she hid the two men Joshua sent to spy out Jericho.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="27">Yahweh &amp;quot;s presence was with Joshua, and he became famous throughout the land.</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="7">
			<VERS vnumber="1">But the Israelites violated the commandment regarding the wealth of Jericho that was to be set apart for the Lord . Achan son of Carmi, grandson of Zimri, of the clan of Zerah, from the tribe of Judah, stole some of the devoted things for himself. This ignited Yahweh &amp;quot;s anger against Israel.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Joshua sent spies from Jericho to Ai (a small city near Beth Aven, southeast of Bethel), with orders to spy out the land. So the spies left for Ai.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">When they returned to Joshua, they reported to him, &amp;apos;There is no need to trouble the whole army to conquer Ai. The people are so few that two or three thousand men could attack it and take the city .&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">So Joshua sent three thousand troops to attack the city, but they were routed by the men of Ai.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">The men of Ai chased them from the city gates, down the hill as far as the quarries, cutting them down as they fled. They killed thirty-six of Joshua&amp;quot;s men, and when Israel heard of their defeat, their hearts melted away with fear!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Joshua and the elders of Israel tore their clothes and threw dust over their heads to show their sorrow. They threw themselves facedown to the ground in front of the ark of Yahweh until the evening sacrifice .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Joshua cried out, &amp;apos;O Lord Yahweh , why did you lead these people across the Jordan? To be defeated? To be killed by the Amorites? If only we had been content to stay on the other side of the Jordan!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">O Lord, what can I say now that Israel has retreated from its enemies?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">When the Canaanites and everyone else in the land hear about our defeat , they will gang up on us and wipe us off the face of the earth. And what then will you do about your great name?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Yahweh spoke to Joshua: &amp;apos;Stand up! Why are you groveling before me?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Israel has sinned! They have broken the covenant which I had commanded them to keep. They have taken forbidden plunder. They have stolen from me, taken what is mine, hidden it among their belongings, and lied about it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Cursed things are among you! That is why Israel is powerless, has retreated from their enemies, and is in danger of annihilation. If you do not get rid of these cursed things from among you, I will not go with you any longer.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Get up and purify the people in preparation for tomorrow. Tell them, &amp;quot;This is what Yahweh , the God of Israel says: &amp;apos;O Israel, you have in your midst what must be devoted entirely to me! You cannot stand against your enemies until you remove the devoted things from your midst!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Tomorrow morning, you shall present yourselves by tribes. Yahweh will indicate which tribe must come forward by clans. Yahweh will indicate which clan must come forward by families. And Yahweh will indicate which family must come forward one by one.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Then finally, Yahweh will expose the man caught with the devoted things, which must be destroyed by fire. Everything that man owns you must likewise destroy by fire, for he has violated the covenant of Yahweh and committed an outrageous act in Israel!&amp;quot; &amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Joshua was up at the crack of dawn and had Israel come forward by tribes, and Yahweh indicated the tribe of Judah.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Joshua then had the clans of Judah come forward, and Yahweh picked out the clan of Zerah. Joshua then had the clan of Zerah come forward and Yahweh indicated the family of Zimri.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Joshua then had Zimri&amp;quot;s family come forward one by one, and Yahweh picked out Achan, the son of Carmi, son of Zimri, son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Then Joshua said to Achan, &amp;apos;My son, give glory to Yahweh , the God of Israel, and confess. Tell me the truth and do not hide anything from him. What have you done?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">&amp;apos;It&amp;quot;s true,&amp;apos; Achan said. &amp;apos;I&amp;quot;ve sinned against Yahweh , the God of Israel. This is what I did:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">I saw among the plunder an exquisite robe from Babylon, two hundred pieces of silver, and a fifty-shekel bar of gold. I wanted them badly, so I took them and buried them in my tent with the silver underneath.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Joshua sent messengers who ran to the tent, and there it was! They found it buried in the middle of the tent with the silver underneath.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">They took the stolen objects from the tent, brought them to Joshua and all the Israelites, and displayed them in the presence of Yahweh .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">Then Joshua, and all Israel with him, took Achan son of Zerah along with the silver, the robe, the bar of gold, and all that belonged to him&amp;ndash;his sons, daughters, donkeys, oxen, sheep, tent&amp;ndash;everything. Joshua led them all to the Valley of Trouble</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">and said, &amp;apos;Why have you brought all this trouble on us? Yahweh will bring trouble on you today!&amp;apos; Then all the people stoned Achan and his family to death. They burned up the bodies and all Achan&amp;quot;s possessions.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">They raised over him a huge mound of stones that remains to this day. That is why the place was called the Valley of Trouble ever since. Afterward, Yahweh &amp;quot;s anger subsided against Israel.</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="8">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Yahweh said to Joshua, &amp;apos;Do not yield to fear nor shrink back because of Israel&amp;quot;s failure . Now, get up, take all your soldiers with you, and march against Ai. See, I have handed over to you the city, the king, his people, and his land.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Do to Ai what you did to Jericho and its king, except this time, you may take the plunder, including livestock. Set an ambush behind the city.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Joshua and his entire army set out to attack Ai. He chose thirty thousand valiant warriors and sent them ahead by night</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">with these instructions: &amp;apos;Now pay attention. Set an ambush behind Ai, but don&amp;quot;t hide very far away. Stay alert and ready for battle!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">I&amp;quot;ll lead the rest of the army and make a direct assault on the city, and when they come out to fight us, we&amp;quot;ll flee from them as we did the first time.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">When this happens, they&amp;quot;ll say to themselves, &amp;quot;Look! They&amp;quot;re running away from us, just like last time!&amp;quot; And they&amp;quot;ll keep chasing us until we&amp;quot;ve lured them away from the city. While we&amp;quot;re running away from them,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">jump up from your hiding place, race into Ai, and seize it. Yahweh , your God, will deliver the city into your hands!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">When you&amp;quot;ve captured the city, set it on fire. Now that you have your orders, go and do as Yahweh has commanded!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Joshua then sent them off, and they proceeded to take up a concealed position west of Ai, between Ai and Bethel, while Joshua spent the night with the rest of the troops.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">So early the next morning, Joshua mustered his troops. He and the leaders of Israel went in front of the army and led them toward Ai.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">The entire fighting force with Joshua advanced until they were near the city and encamped north of Ai, with a valley between them and the city.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">He placed a smaller force of about five thousand men west of the city to set an ambush between Bethel and Ai.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">The main fighting force north of the city prepared for battle, while the rear guard held a concealed position west of the city. Joshua spent the night in the valley.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">At dawn, when the king of Ai saw the Israelites, he and his army rushed out to fight. They ran to attack Israel at a predetermined place en route to the Arabah, not knowing that an ambush had been set against them behind the city.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Joshua and all the main fighting force fled toward the wilderness as though they were being overcome.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Joshua&amp;quot;s tactic drew all of Ai&amp;quot;s reinforcements out of the city, and they set off in hot pursuit of Joshua and his men .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Not a man remained in Ai or in Bethel who did not go out in pursuit of Israel, leaving their city undefended.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Then Yahweh spoke to Joshua and said, &amp;apos;Now, take the spear in your hand and point it toward Ai, for I will hand the city over to you!&amp;apos; So Joshua pointed his spear toward the city,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">and when Joshua gave this signal, all the men waiting in ambush behind the city jumped up from their position and poured into Ai. They quickly captured it and set it on fire.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">The men who had taken the city came out and joined the battle, so the Israelites had them surrounded. Israel cut them down, leaving neither survivors nor fugitives.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">But they captured the king of Ai alive and brought him to Joshua.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">Joshua&amp;quot;s men killed all the inhabitants of Ai in the fields and in the wilderness where they had chased them. They all fell by the sword. Then the Israelites turned to attack Ai and killed those who were still there.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">However, the Israelites took the livestock and the goods captured in the city as Yahweh had instructed Joshua.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">Then Joshua burned Ai to the ground and reduced it to a mound of ruins for all time. It remains desolate to this day.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">And he hanged the king of Ai on a tree until sunset. Then at sunset, Joshua had the corpse taken down and left it lying in front of where the city gates once stood . They raised a large pile of stones over his corpse, where it remains to this day.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">Afterward, Joshua built near Mount Ebal a stone altar to Yahweh , the God of Israel.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">He made it according to the teaching in the law of Moses, Yahweh &amp;quot;s servant. Moses had commanded them to build an altar using stones that had not been cut with iron tools. On it they offered to Yahweh burnt sacrifices and fellowship offerings.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">And with the Israelites looking on, Joshua inscribed on stones the law which Moses had written.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">All Israel, including their elders, officials, and judges, stood on either side of the ark. Both native-born citizens and immigrants alike faced the ark of the covenant of Yahweh and the Levitical priests who carried it. In front of half of them stood Mount Gerizim, and in front of the other half stood Mount Ebal, as Yahweh &amp;quot;s servant Moses commanded at first to bless the people of Israel.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">Afterward, Joshua read aloud all the words of the law, the blessings and the curses, exactly as it was written in the scroll of the law.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">Joshua read aloud every word that Moses had commanded, and all the assembly of Israel heard it, including the women, the children, and the foreigners who accompanied them.</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="9">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Now when all the kings west of the Jordan heard about these things&amp;ndash;those in the hill country, in the western foothills, and along the entire coast of the Great Sea as far as Lebanon (the kings of the Hittites, Amorites, Canaanites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites)&amp;ndash;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">they came together to make war against Joshua and Israel.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">When the inhabitants of Gibeon learned how Joshua had destroyed Jericho and Ai,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">they resorted to a ruse: They sent a delegation disguised as messengers from a distant land . They loaded their donkeys with worn-out sacks and old, patched wineskins.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">They wore old, patched sandals on their feet and old, tattered clothes, and took along dry, moldy bread.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">When they arrived at Israel&amp;quot;s camp at Gilgal, they said to Joshua and the Israelites: &amp;apos;We&amp;quot;ve come from a far country to propose that you make a treaty with us.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">The men of Israel asked the Hivites, &amp;apos;Perhaps you live nearby. Why should we make a treaty with you?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">&amp;apos;We are willing to be your servants,&amp;apos; they answered Joshua. Joshua questioned them further, &amp;apos;Who are you and where are you from?&amp;apos; This caused Israel to grumble against their leaders,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">The Gibeonites replied: &amp;apos;Your servants come from a very distant land because we&amp;quot;ve heard of the fame of your God, Yahweh . We&amp;quot;ve heard of his wonders and all that he did in Egypt.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">We&amp;quot;ve also heard of all he did to help you defeat the two Amorite kings on the other side of the Jordan&amp;ndash;King Sihon of Heshbon and King Og of Bashan, who lived in Ashtaroth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Therefore, our leaders and all the inhabitants of our land sent us to find you with these instructions: &amp;quot;Get food ready for your long trip, and go to the Israelites and say to them, &amp;apos;Make a treaty with us. We&amp;quot;re willing to be your servants.&amp;apos; &amp;quot;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Look at our bread! It was still warm when we left home with it. See how dry and moldy it&amp;quot;s become!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">These wineskins were new when we filled them. See how they&amp;quot;ve dried up and burst! And look, our clothes and sandals are worn out from our long journey.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">The leaders of Israel ratified a peace treaty with the Gibeonites by sharing a meal together, but they failed to consult with Yahweh .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Joshua agreed to let them live. He made a peace treaty with them, and the leaders of the assembly sealed it with an oath.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">But three days after the treaty had been made, the Israelites learned that they had been deceived . In fact, the Gibeonites were from the local area and lived nearby.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">So the Israelites set out at once, and on the third day, they came to their cities: Gibeon, Chephirah, Beeroth, and Kiriath Jearim.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">But the Israelites did not attack them because the leaders of the assembly had sworn an oath to them in the name of Yahweh , the God of Israel.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">but the leaders told the assembly of Israel, &amp;apos;We cannot touch them, for we swore an oath to them in the name of Yahweh , the God of Israel.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Joshua summoned the Gibeonites and asked them, &amp;apos;Why did you deceive us? You told us that you lived very far from us, but we now know for a fact that you live right here near us.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">Therefore, we will spare your lives , but you will live under a curse, and you will be condemned to perpetual servitude. You will serve the house of my God by cutting wood and carrying water for us.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">They answered Joshua, &amp;apos;We lied, sir, because we greatly feared for our lives. We know for certain all about Moses and how he served Yahweh , your God. We know for certain that Yahweh will honor his promise to Moses and give you all these lands as your own. And we know for certain that he commanded you to wipe out all the inhabitants living here and thus take possession of this land.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">Now we are at your mercy, so do with us what you consider right and proper.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">So Joshua had mercy and saved them from being killed by the Israelites.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">That day, he made them woodcutters and water carriers to serve the community of Israel for the altar of Yahweh at his divinely chosen place. And that is what they do to this day.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="7">So Joshua and all his fighting men, all the mighty warriors of Israel, left Gilgal to aid the Gibeonites .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Yahweh spoke to Joshua: &amp;apos;Do not fear the Amorite kings and their armies, for I have decreed your victory over them; not one will withstand you!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Joshua and his fighting force marched all night long from Gilgal to Gibeon and took them all by surprise!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Joshua inflicted a crushing defeat on them at Gibeon, for Yahweh threw the Amorites into a panic at the sudden sight of Israel&amp;quot;s army! Yahweh empowered Joshua and his army to chase them in the direction of the Beth Horon ascent, and they slaughtered the kings&amp;quot; armies all the way to Azekah and the city of Makkedah .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">As the Amorites raced down the hill to Beth Horon, Yahweh hurled large hailstones on them from the sky! The hail continued to fall all the way to Azekah; in fact, more men died from Yahweh &amp;quot;s hailstones than by the swords of the Israelites.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Yahweh gave the men of Israel victory over the Amorites that day, the day when Joshua stood before the people and prayed to Yahweh : &amp;apos;Sun, stand still over Gibeon! Moon, stay where you are over the valley of Aijalon!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">And so the sun stood still in the middle of the sky and was in no hurry to set until one day became two . And the moon halted while the nation triumphed over its enemies&amp;ndash;as it is also recorded in the Scroll of the Upright One.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">It was the day Yahweh himself fought for Israel! There has never been a day like it before or since&amp;ndash;a day when Yahweh obeyed the voice of a man!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">After their victory , Joshua and his fighting men returned to their camp at Gilgal.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Meanwhile, the five Amorite kings fled and hid in a cave at Makkedah.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">When Joshua was told that the five kings had been found hiding in a cave at Makkedah,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Joshua ordered his men, &amp;apos;Seal up the mouth of the cave with large stones and post guards in front of it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">But don&amp;quot;t stop! Pursue your enemies! Cut off their retreat and don&amp;quot;t let them reach their cities, for Yahweh your God has given them into your hand!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">So Joshua and the Israelites nearly killed them all&amp;ndash;almost to a man&amp;ndash;although a few escaped into the fortified cities.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">The whole army returned safely to Joshua at the camp in Makkedah. No one dared speak against the Israelites.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Then Joshua ordered, &amp;apos;Open up the cave and bring the five kings out to me.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">So Joshua&amp;quot;s men removed the five kings from the cave, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, and the king of Eglon, and brought them before Joshua.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">Joshua summoned all of Israel and ordered his army officers, &amp;apos;Place your feet on the necks of these kings.&amp;apos; So they placed their feet upon their necks!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">Then Joshua said to his officers, &amp;apos;Never be afraid of your enemies or let them discourage you. Be strong and filled with courage! Yahweh is going to do to all your enemies what he&amp;quot;s done to these kings!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">Then Joshua had the kings executed and hanged on five trees, and he left them there until evening.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">At sunset, Joshua ordered them taken down from the trees and thrown into the cave where they had been hiding. He had large stones rolled over the mouth of the cave, and they remain there to this day.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">That day, Joshua captured Makkedah, annihilated the inhabitants, and put its king to the sword, leaving no survivors. And he did to its king what had been done to the king of Jericho.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">From Makkedah, Joshua and his army marched southwest to the city of Libnah and attacked it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">By the power of Yahweh , the city and its king were handed over to the Israelites. They annihilated all the inhabitants with the sword, leaving no survivors. And they did to its king what they had done to the king of Jericho.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">From Libnah, Joshua and his army marched south to the city of Lachish and attacked it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">By the power of Yahweh , the city was handed over to Joshua on the second day of the battle. They annihilated all the inhabitants of the city, just as they had done to Libnah.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">Meanwhile, Horam, king of Gezer, had marched out to help Lachish, but Joshua defeated him and his army, leaving no survivors.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">Then Joshua and all the Israelite army marched on from Lachish to attack the city of Eglon.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">By the power of Yahweh , they captured the city in one day and destroyed its inhabitants, just as they had done to Lachish.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">Then Joshua and all the Israelite army marched from Eglon and attacked Hebron.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">By the power of Yahweh , they captured the city, the king, and nearby villages, and totally wiped out all the inhabitants, leaving no survivors, just as they had done to Eglon.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">Lastly, Joshua and all the Israelite army turned around and attacked Debir.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">By the power of Yahweh , they captured the city, the king, and nearby villages, and totally wiped out all the inhabitants, leaving no survivors. They did to Debir and its king as they had done to Libnah and its king and to Hebron.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">Yahweh empowered Joshua to conquer the whole region, including the hill country, the southern desert, the western foothills, and the mountain slopes. He conquered all the kings of the land and left no survivors. Everything that breathed was slaughtered&amp;ndash;as Yahweh , the God of Israel, had commanded.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">Joshua&amp;quot;s conquest stretched from Kadesh Barnea to Gaza, and from Goshen to Gibeon.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">Joshua conquered all their kings and their lands in a single campaign, for Yahweh , the God of Israel, fought for his people.</VERS>

Part of the Israelite army attacked and pursued the retreating forces as far north as the cities of Misrephoth Maim and Sidon.

			<VERS vnumber="1">And after Joshua died, the twelve tribal leaders consulted Yahweh for a prophetic sign and asked, &amp;apos;Which tribe do you choose to be the first to lead the attack against the Canaanites?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Yahweh answered them, &amp;apos;Let Judah take the lead.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">I have delivered the land into their hands.&amp;apos; Judah then enlisted support from their brother-tribe Simeon, saying, &amp;apos;Follow us into our territory and fight with us against the Canaanites; then we will do the same for you.&amp;apos; So the Simeonites agreed and joined them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">When Judah advanced, Yahweh gave them victory over the Canaanites and Perizzites, and they defeated ten thousand men at Bezek.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Adoni-Bezek confessed, &amp;apos;I once had seventy kings picking up scraps under my table with their thumbs and big toes cut off. Now God has paid me back for what I did to them!&amp;apos; They took him captive to Jerusalem, where he died.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">The men of Judah attacked Jerusalem and captured it. They killed the inhabitants of the city and set it on fire.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Afterward, the men of Judah continued their advance and attacked the Canaanites living in the hill country, the southern desert region, and the western lowlands.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Under Caleb&amp;quot;s leadership , they fought against the Canaanites living in Hebron, formerly known as Kiriath Arba, and killed the three Canaanite families descended from Sheshai, Ahiman, and Talmai.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">From there, they attacked the city of Debir, formerly known as Kiriath Sepher.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Caleb announced, &amp;apos;I will give my daughter Achsah in marriage to the man who attacks and captures Kiriath Sepher.&amp;apos;</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="16">The descendants of Moses&amp;quot; father-in-law, the Kenite, joined the people of Judah, and went with them from Jericho , the City of Date Palms, to the Judean wilderness. The Kenites had settled there among the Amalekites at Arad.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="31">The tribe of Asher failed to drive out the Canaanites living in Acco, Sidon, Ahlab, Achzib, Helbah, Aphik, and Rehob,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">so the people of Asher live among the Canaanites residing in the land because they did not conquer them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">Likewise, the tribe of Naphtali failed to drive out the Canaanites living in Beth Shemesh or Beth Anath, so they live among the Canaanites residing in the land. However, they forced the inhabitants of Beth Shemesh and Beth Anath to serve them.</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="2">
			<VERS vnumber="1">The Angel of Yahweh went up from Gilgal to Bokim and said to the people: &amp;apos;I rescued you from Egypt and brought you into the land I had promised to your ancestors. I said, &amp;quot;I will never, never break my covenant with you,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">and you are never, never to make a covenant with the inhabitants of this land. You must tear down their altars to their false gods !&amp;quot; But you have not listened to my voice. See what you have done!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Therefore listen to what I&amp;quot;m telling you&amp;ndash;I won&amp;quot;t drive them out before you. Instead, they will be thorns in your sides, and their gods will become a trap for you!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">After the Angel of Yahweh had delivered his message to all the Israelites, the people burst out with loud, bitter weeping.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">So they named that place Bokim, and in that place of tears they offered sacrifices to Yahweh .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Then Joshua released the people to go take possession of their territorial inheritance.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">The people faithfully worshiped Yahweh all the days of Joshua and through all the days of the elders who outlived him. They had all experienced the many astounding miracles Yahweh had done for Israel.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Yahweh &amp;quot;s servant, Joshua son of Nun, died at the age of one hundred and ten</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">and the people buried him on his own parcel of land in the hill country of Ephraim at Timnath Serah, north of Mount Gaash.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Eventually, after that entire generation died and was buried, the next generation forgot Yahweh and all that he had done for Israel.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">The Israelites did what was evil in the sight of Yahweh and worshiped the images of Baal.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Israel deserted Yahweh , the God of their ancestors, who had rescued them from Egypt. They found new gods to worship&amp;ndash;the gods of the people around them. They bowed down to them and provoked Yahweh to anger.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">They completely abandoned Yahweh to serve Baal and the images of the goddess Astarte.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">They caused the anger of Yahweh to be kindled against Israel, and he handed them over to invaders, who plundered them. He surrendered them to their enemies on all sides, and they could no longer defend themselves.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Every time they went into battle, Yahweh raised his hand against them to their undoing, just as he had warned them, and they were in great distress.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Nevertheless, Yahweh raised up deliverers from among them who rescued them from the marauding bands.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Rather than listen to their deliverers, they prostituted themselves to other gods and bowed down to worship them. This new generation quickly turned from the good path and refused to be like their ancestors who actually listened to Yahweh &amp;quot;s commands.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Yet, whenever Yahweh raised up a hero for them, his presence and power were with that leader, and he would rescue the people from their enemies as long as that deliverer lived. Yahweh had mercy and pitied them because of their cries of distress and groanings under the grip of their oppressors.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">But when their champion died, then the people would relapse into their former idolatry. They would worship other gods, bow down to them, and refuse to give up their evil ways. And each generation behaved worse than the one before it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Then Yahweh became furious with Israel, saying, &amp;apos;Because this nation has violated the covenant that I commanded their fathers to keep, and because they no longer listen to my voice,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">I will no longer drive out any of the nations that remained in the land after Joshua died.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Over and over Yahweh tested Israel to see if they would faithfully walk in his ways, as their ancestors had done.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">So Yahweh intentionally left pagan nations in the land instead of driving them all out at once, and he did not give Joshua the victory over them, nor did he drive them out after Joshua&amp;quot;s death .</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="3">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Here is a list of the nations that Yahweh permitted to remain in the land so he could use them to test the Israelites who had not known what it was like during the Canaanite wars.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">He wanted the succeeding generations of Israel, who had not known war before, to learn the art of warfare.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">So he left in the land the five Philistine principalities and all the Canaanites, Sidonians, and Hivites who lived on Mount Lebanon from Mount Baal Hermon as far as Lebo Hamath.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">They remained in the land to test Israel to see if they would obey Yahweh &amp;quot;s commands that Moses had given to their ancestors.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">So the Israelites settled among the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">They took their daughters in marriage and gave their own daughters to their sons; and the Israelites served their false gods.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">The Israelites did what was evil in Yahweh &amp;quot;s sight. They ignored Yahweh their God, and they served the Baal gods and the Asherah goddesses.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Therefore Yahweh &amp;quot;s blazing anger rose up against them. He surrendered them to Cushan-Rishathaim, the king of Mesopotamia. He kept the Israelites in bondage to him for eight years.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Then the Israelites, with shattered hearts , cried out to Yahweh for mercy , and he answered them by raising up a champion-deliverer to rescue them, Othniel. He was Caleb&amp;quot;s nephew, the son of his younger brother Kenaz.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">And the Spirit of Yahweh was upon him and empowered him to liberate Israel from bondage . He became Israel&amp;quot;s champion and went out to war, and Yahweh delivered into his hands Cushan-Rishathaim, the king of Mesopotamia. Othniel overpowered him,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">and after the land had peace for forty years, Othniel the son of Kenaz died.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">The Israelites again did what was evil in Yahweh &amp;quot;s sight, and because they did what was offensive to Yahweh , he gave King Eglon of Moab power over Israel.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Eglon formed an alliance with the Ammonites and Amalekites, and they attacked and defeated Israel. Eglon captured Jericho , the City of Date Palms.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">King Eglon of Moab kept the Israelites in bondage to him for eighteen years.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Then the Israelites, with shattered hearts , cried out to Yahweh for mercy, and Yahweh raised up a champion-deliverer to rescue them&amp;ndash;Ehud, who was left-handed. He was the son of Gera from the tribe of Benjamin. One day, the Israelites sent him to present tribute to King Eglon of Moab. After all the king&amp;quot;s servants had left,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Ehud had made for himself a two-edged sword over a foot long, which he strapped under his coat to his right thigh.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">He and his entourage came before King Eglon, who was a very fat man, to present the tribute.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">After the formal presentation of the tribute, he told the men who accompanied him to go back home.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Ehud went with them part of the way , but he turned back at the carved stones near Gilgal. He returned to Eglon and said, &amp;apos;Your Majesty, I have a secret message for you.&amp;apos; The king said to his attendants, &amp;apos;Leave us!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Ehud approached King Eglon while he was sitting alone in his cool upper room and said to him, &amp;apos;I have a message from God for you.&amp;apos; As the king rose from his throne,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Ehud reached beneath his robe with his left hand for the sword strapped to his right thigh, and he plunged it deep into Eglon&amp;quot;s belly!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">And the hilt also went in after the blade, and the fat closed over the blade. Ehud was unable to pull out the sword, and the dung came out.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">Stepping out of the king&amp;quot;s upper room into the portico, Ehud shut and locked the doors behind him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">After he had slipped away, the king&amp;quot;s servants came to the doors of the upper room and discovered they were locked. So they told themselves, &amp;apos;He must be on the toilet.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">They waited and waited, but still the king did not emerge. Embarrassed, they finally took their key and unlocked the doors. And when they opened the doors, there was their master sprawled out on the floor, dead!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">But Ehud had escaped while they stood there wondering what to do. He fled beyond the carved stones and made it to Seirah.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">When he arrived back in the land , he sounded the war trumpet with a loud blast and rallied the people in the hill country of Ephraim. The Israelites went down from the hills to fight against the Moabites with Ehud leading the charge.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">&amp;apos;Follow me closely,&amp;apos; he said, &amp;apos;and pursue them, for Yahweh has delivered your enemies, the Moabites, into your hands!&amp;apos; So they followed his lead and secured the fords of the Jordan opposite the land of Moab and did not let anyone cross.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">In the battle that ensued, they killed nearly ten thousand able-bodied men&amp;ndash;brave warriors of Moab, and not one escaped.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">On that day, Moab surrendered to Israel, and the land had peace for eighty years.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">After Ehud, God raised up Shamgar son of Anath, who killed six hundred Philistines with nothing but an ox-goad, and Shamgar the deliverer rescued Israel.</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="4">
			<VERS vnumber="1">After Ehud died, the Israelites returned to doing evil before the eyes of Yahweh ,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">so he surrendered them to King Jabin of Canaan, who ruled from Hazor. His army commander Sisera established his base in Harosheth of the Gentiles.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Jabin had nine hundred chariots with iron-rimmed wheels, and he ruthlessly oppressed Israel for twenty years. Then the Israelites, with shattered hearts , cried out to Yahweh for help.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">God raised up Deborah to lead Israel as a champion-deliverer. She was a prophetess and a fiery woman.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">She presided as Israel&amp;quot;s judge under the Palm of Deborah, a certain palm tree between Ramah and Bethel in the hill country of Ephraim, and the people of Israel came to her for wise decisions.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">One day she sent for Barak son of Abinoam from the city of Kedesh in Naphtali and said to him, &amp;apos; Yahweh , the God of Israel, commands you: &amp;quot;Go, deploy ten thousand men from the tribes of Naphtali and Zebulun, and march to Mount Tabor.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">I will draw Sisera, the commander of Jabin&amp;quot;s army, to fight against you at the Kishon River. He will have his many chariots and soldiers, but I will give you victory over him.&amp;quot; &amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Barak replied, &amp;apos;I will go if you go with me, but if you don&amp;quot;t go with me, I won&amp;quot;t go either.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">&amp;apos;Very well,&amp;apos; she answered. &amp;apos;I will go with you, but you will receive no glory in the victory because Yahweh will hand over Sisera to a woman.&amp;apos; So Deborah set off for Kedesh with Barak.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Barak summoned the tribes of Zebulun and Naphtali to Kedesh, and ten thousand warriors followed him and Deborah also.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Now Heber the Kenite migrated away from the other Kenites (the descendants of Hobab, Moses&amp;quot; father-in-law) and was living close to Kedesh near the oak tree at Zaanannim.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">When Sisera found out that Barak son of Abinoam was marching toward Mount Tabor,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">he gathered together his nine hundred iron-rimmed chariots and all his soldiers and sent them from Harosheth of the Gentiles to the Kishon River.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Then Deborah prophesied to Barak, &amp;apos;Today, Yahweh has given you victory over Sisera! Go! Yahweh is marching out before you!&amp;apos; Immediately, Barak charged down from Mount Tabor with his ten thousand warriors.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">And Yahweh threw Sisera and his army into confusion before the onslaught of Barak and his men. Sisera and all his chariots and men were overwhelmed. He leaped from his chariot and fled on foot.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Barak pursued the other chariots and the army to Harosheth of the Gentiles until Sisera&amp;quot;s whole army was killed by the sword, and only Sisera survived.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">He ran for his life to the tent of Jael wife of Heber the Kenite, for there was friendship between King Jabin of Hazor and the family of Heber the Kenite.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Jael came out of her tent to greet Sisera and said to him, &amp;apos;Come in, my lord, come in here. You have nothing to fear.&amp;apos; As soon as he entered her tent, she hid him under a blanket.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Sisera said to her, &amp;apos;I&amp;quot;m so thirsty. Please let me have some water.&amp;apos; So she opened a skin of milk, gave him some to drink, and covered him again.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">He said to her, &amp;apos;Stand at the entrance of your tent. If anybody comes and asks you if there is anybody here, tell them, &amp;quot;No.&amp;quot; &amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Exhausted, he fell fast asleep under the blanket. While he slept, Jael wife of Heber took a tent peg in one hand and a hammer in the other and tiptoed over to where he was lying. And with a crushing blow , she drove the tent peg through his temple until it went down into the ground&amp;ndash;he was dead!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Just then, Barak arrived in pursuit of Sisera. Jael went out of her tent to greet him and said, &amp;apos;Come, let me show you the man you&amp;quot;re looking for.&amp;apos; He went inside with her, and there was Sisera lying dead with the tent peg through his temple.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">On that day God humiliated King Jabin of Canaan before the Israelites.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="11">The Angel of Yahweh came to the village of Ophrah and sat down under the oak tree that belonged to Joash, a man of the clan of Abiezer. His son Gideon was secretly threshing some wheat in a winepress so that the Midianites would not see him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Yahweh &amp;quot;s Angel suddenly appeared to Gideon and said, &amp;apos; Yahweh &amp;quot;s presence goes with you, man of fearless courage!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">&amp;apos;Me?&amp;apos; Gideon replied. &amp;apos;But sir, if Yahweh is truly with us, why have all these troubles come to us? Where are all his miracle-wonders that our fathers told us about when they said, &amp;quot;Did not Yahweh deliver us out of Egypt?&amp;quot; But now Yahweh has abandoned us and put us under the power of the Midianites.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Then Yahweh himself faced Gideon directly and said, &amp;apos;Am I not sending you? With my presence you have all you need . Go in the strength that you now have and rescue Israel from Midian&amp;quot;s power!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Gideon said to him, &amp;apos;But Lord, how could I ever rescue Israel? Of all the thousands in Manasseh, my clan is the weakest, and I&amp;quot;m the least qualified in my family.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Yahweh replied, &amp;apos; My presence and my power will be with you. Believe me, Gideon , you will crush the Midianites as easily as if they were only one man!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Then Gideon said, &amp;apos;If it&amp;quot;s really true that you will go with me and that I have found grace before your eyes, then show me a miracle-sign to prove that you are really Yahweh speaking with me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Don&amp;quot;t leave until I return with my offering to you.&amp;apos; And he answered, &amp;apos;I&amp;quot;ll wait until you return.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">So Gideon went and cooked a young goat and many loaves of unleavened bread. He placed the meat in a basket and the broth in a pot and took his offering and presented it to him under the oak tree.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">God&amp;quot;s Angel said to Gideon, &amp;apos;Place the meat and the bread on that rock and pour the broth over them.&amp;apos; And Gideon did so.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Then Yahweh &amp;quot;s Angel reached out the staff he was holding and touched the meat and the bread. All at once, supernatural fire sprang up from the rock and burned up the meat and the bread. Then the Angel of Yahweh vanished from his sight.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Immediately, Gideon realized that he had seen the Angel of Yahweh ! Terror stricken , he said, &amp;apos;Oh, Lord Yahweh ! I have seen the Angel of Yahweh face-to-face!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">But Yahweh spoke to him and said, &amp;apos;Be at peace. Don&amp;quot;t be afraid. You will not die.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">So Gideon built an altar to Yahweh there and named it &amp;apos;In Yahweh there is Peace.&amp;apos; (The altar is still standing at Ophrah, which belongs to the clan of Abiezer.)</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">That night, Yahweh spoke to Gideon and said, &amp;apos;Take your father&amp;quot;s bull and the second bull that is seven years old, and go and demolish your father&amp;quot;s altar to Baal. And cut down the tree of the goddess Asherah, which is beside it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">And in their place, on top of the stronghold, build a well-constructed altar to Yahweh your God. Use the Asherah tree you have cut down for firewood. Then take the second bull and burn it whole as an offering.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">So Gideon took ten of his servants and did what Yahweh had told him. Because he feared both his family and the men of the town he did it at night rather than in the daytime.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">When the people of the town got up early the next morning, they found the altar to Baal and the symbol of Asherah cut down, and the second bull burned on the new altar that Gideon had built there.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">They asked each other, &amp;apos;Who did this?&amp;apos; After investigating thoroughly, they concluded that it was the work of Gideon son of Joash.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">Enraged, they demanded of Joash, &amp;apos;Bring your son out here and we will kill him! He tore down the altar to Baal and chopped down the Asherah tree beside it.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">But Joash said to all those who confronted him, &amp;apos;Does Baal need you to fight his battles? Are you really going to rescue him? I will kill anyone who stands up for Baal before morning. If Baal is a god, let him fight his own battles and defend his own altar!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">From then on, Gideon&amp;quot;s nickname was &amp;apos;Jerubbaal,&amp;apos; that is to say, &amp;apos;Let Baal contend against him,&amp;apos; because he broke down his altar.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">Now all the Midianites, the Amalekites, and the people of the East formed an army. They crossed the Jordan and camped in the Valley of Jezreel to fight against Israel .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">Then the Spirit of Yahweh clothed himself in Gideon and enveloped him ! Gideon sounded a blast of the shofar to call the men of the clan of Abiezer to follow him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">He sent messengers throughout the territory of both parts of Manasseh, and throughout the territory of Asher, Zebulun, and Naphtali&amp;ndash;to call them to follow Gideon into battle. And they all came to join him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">Gideon said to God, &amp;apos;If you have really chosen me to rescue Israel, as you said,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">then give me proof . Here&amp;ndash;I am placing a wool fleece on the threshing floor. If in the morning the dew is only on the wool but not on the ground around it, then I will know for sure that I&amp;quot;m the one you have chosen to rescue Israel, as you said.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">And that is exactly what happened. When Gideon got up early the next morning, he squeezed the fleece and wrung out enough dew to fill a bowl.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">Then Gideon said to God, &amp;apos;Don&amp;quot;t be angry with me; let me speak just once more. Please let me ask you for one more sign. This time let the fleece be dry, and the ground wet.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">That night God did what Gideon had asked. The next morning the fleece was dry, but dew covered the ground around it.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="7">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Now, the Baal-Fighter (that is, Gideon) and his men rose early and encamped by the Spring of Trembling. The Midianites had encamped in the valley to the north, below Moreh.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Yahweh spoke to Gideon: &amp;apos;You have too many in your army. If I give them victory over the Midianites, they might claim credit for themselves at my expense, thinking that they had won the victory on their own.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Announce to your men, &amp;quot;All who are trembling and afraid, hurry back home and leave Mount Gilead!&amp;quot; &amp;apos; So twenty-two thousand went back home, and only ten thousand stayed with Gideon.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Then Yahweh spoke to Gideon again, &amp;apos;You still have too many men. Take them down to the water, and I will test them for you there. If I tell you a man should go with you, he will go. If I tell you a man should not go with you, he will not go.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">So Gideon brought the soldiers down to the water, and Yahweh said to him, &amp;apos;Separate those who drink from their cupped hands and drink as a dog laps from those who kneel down to drink.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Of the ten thousand men, only three hundred lapped water from their cupped hands; all the others knelt to drink.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Then Yahweh told Gideon, &amp;apos;I will give you victory over the Midianites with the three hundred men who cupped their hands and drank. Tell everyone else to go home.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">So Gideon sent all the Israelites home except the three hundred, who kept the supplies and shofars of those who had left. Now the Midianites were camped down below in the valley.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">That night Yahweh commanded Gideon, &amp;apos;Get up and attack the camp; I am giving you victory over the Midianites!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">But if you are afraid to engage them, first go down to the camp with your servant Purah.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Listen to what they are saying, and then you will be brave and have the courage to attack.&amp;apos; So Gideon and his servant Purah went down and approached the outposts of the enemy camp.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">The Midianites, the Amalekites, and the desert tribesmen were spread out in the valley like a swarm of locusts. They had as many camels as there were grains of sand on the seashore.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">As soon as Gideon arrived, he heard an enemy soldier telling a friend about a dream. He was saying, &amp;apos;Well, I had a dream of this huge commotion in our camp. I dreamed a round loaf of barley bread came whirling into our camp and leveled a tent. It hit the tent so hard it turned it upside down, and the tent collapsed on the ground.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">His friend interpreted the dream and said, &amp;apos;Your dream symbolizes the sword of the Israelite, Gideon son of Joash! It can&amp;quot;t mean anything else! God has given him victory over Midian and our whole army!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">When Gideon heard about the man&amp;quot;s dream and what it meant, he fell to his knees and worshiped Yahweh . Then he went back to the Israelite camp and shouted, &amp;apos;Come on, it&amp;quot;s time to strike! Yahweh is giving you victory over the Midianite army!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">He divided his three hundred men into three groups and gave each man a shofar and a clay jar hiding a torch inside it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">He told them, &amp;apos;Follow me! When I get to the edge of the camp, watch me closely and do exactly what I do.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">When my group and I blow our shofars, then you blow yours all around the camp and shout, &amp;quot;For Yahweh and for Gideon!&amp;quot; &amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Each man held his position surrounding the camp. And the entire enemy army was shocked awake by the thunderous noises of Gideon&amp;quot;s army! They all panicked and fled, yelling as they ran away!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">When they sounded their three hundred shofars, Yahweh made the enemy troops turn against each other with their own swords. The Midianites fled toward Zarerah as far as Beth Shittah, as far as the outskirts of the town of Abel Meholah near Tabbath.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">Gideon called to arms men from the tribes of Naphtali, Asher, and both parts of Manasseh, and they rallied and pursued the Midianites.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">Then Gideon sent messengers through the entire hill country of Ephraim, saying, &amp;apos;Join us in the fight against the Midianites. Deny them access to the River Jordan and the streams as far as Beth Barah, and prevent them from crossing over .&amp;apos; The men of Ephraim came together, and they held the River Jordan and the streams as far as Beth Barah.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">They captured the two Midianite chiefs, Oreb and Zeeb. They executed Oreb at Oreb Rock and Zeeb at Zeeb Winepress. While the Ephraimites continued to pursue the Midianites, they brought the heads of Oreb and Zeeb to Gideon, who was now east of the Jordan.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="8">
			<VERS vnumber="1">The men of Ephraim got into a heated argument with Gideon and complained to him, &amp;apos;Why didn&amp;quot;t you tell us you were going to fight the Midianites? Why did you do that to us?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Gideon replied, &amp;apos;What have I accomplished compared to you? What your tribe did is worth so much more than what my whole clan has done.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">After all, through the power of God, you killed both Midianite chiefs, Oreb and Zeeb. What have I done compared with you?&amp;apos; After he said this, they calmed down and were no longer so angry.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Totally exhausted, Gideon and his three hundred men crossed the river Jordan and continued to pursue the enemy.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">When they arrived at Succoth, he said to the men of the town, &amp;apos;Please give my men some loaves of bread. They are exhausted, and I am still pursuing the two Midianite kings, Zebah and Zalmunna.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">But the leaders of Succoth replied, &amp;apos;Why should we give any food to your army? You haven&amp;quot;t even captured Zebah and Zalmunna yet.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">So Gideon said, &amp;apos;All right! Since you won&amp;quot;t help me, when Yahweh has handed them over to me, I&amp;quot;ll whip you with thorns and briars from the desert!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Gideon went on to Penuel and made the same request of the people there, but the men of Penuel gave him the same reply as the men of Succoth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">So he informed them, &amp;apos;I&amp;quot;ll come back victoriously, and when I do, I will tear your tower down!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Zebah and Zalmunna were at Karkor with an army of fifteen thousand men who survived, for one hundred twenty thousand sword-wielding soldiers had already been killed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Gideon followed the desert trail of the nomads east of Nobah and Jogbehah, surprised the enemy&amp;quot;s army, and ambushed them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">The two Midianite kings, Zebah and Zalmunna, escaped, but Gideon pursued and captured them, and terrified what remained of the Midianite army.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">While Gideon son of Joash was returning from the battle by way of Heres Pass,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">he captured a young man from Succoth and interrogated him. The young man wrote down for Gideon the names of the seventy-seven leading men of Succoth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Then Gideon went to the men of Succoth and said, &amp;apos;You mocked me, refused to help me , and said that you couldn&amp;quot;t give any food to my exhausted army because I had not yet captured Zebah and Zalmunna. Well, here they are!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">As he had promised , Gideon took desert thorns and briars and whipped the leaders of Succoth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">As for Penuel, Gideon tore down its tower and killed the men of that city.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Then Gideon asked the kings, Zebah and Zalmunna, &amp;apos;What can you tell me about the men you killed at Tabor?&amp;apos; They answered, &amp;apos;They looked just like you. Every one of them looked like the son of a king.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Gideon said, &amp;apos;They were my brothers, my own mother&amp;quot;s sons. I swear, as surely as Yahweh lives, that if you had let them live, I would let you live.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Then he turned to Jether, his firstborn son, and said, &amp;apos;Go ahead, kill them now!&amp;apos; But the boy wouldn&amp;quot;t do it. He didn&amp;quot;t draw his sword because he was still only a timid boy.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Then Zebah and Zalmunna taunted Gideon, &amp;apos;Come on, kill us yourself. It takes a man to do a man&amp;quot;s job.&amp;apos; So Gideon executed them and plundered the crescent ornaments that hung on the necks of their camels.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">After that, the Israelites said to Gideon, &amp;apos; You&amp;quot;re our war hero! You&amp;quot;re the one who saved us from the Midianites. You be our ruler! Then your son will rule after you, and then your grandson.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">Gideon answered, &amp;apos;No. Neither I nor my son will be your ruler. Yahweh is to be your only King.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">However, I do have one request,&amp;apos; Gideon added. &amp;apos;Give me all the gold earrings you took from the Midianites.&amp;apos; (It was the custom of the Midianites to wear gold earrings, because they were Ishmaelites.)</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">The people answered, &amp;apos;Gladly. They&amp;quot;re yours!&amp;apos; They spread out a cloth, and each one placed on it the earrings they had taken as plunder.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">Gideon received gold earrings that weighed seventeen hundred shekels, not including the crescent ornaments, necklaces, and fine purple robes of the kings of Midian, nor the ornamental collars taken from the necks of their camels.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">Gideon used all this plunder to make a sacred golden ephod. He put it on display in his hometown, Ophrah, and all Israel strayed from Yahweh and gave over their hearts to the golden ephod. It was a seducing snare for Gideon and his family.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">So Israel defeated Midian, who never troubled them again. The land had peace for forty years until Gideon died.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">Gideon , the Baal-Fighter, son of Joash, returned to his own home and lived there.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">Because he had many wives, Gideon fathered seventy sons.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">In addition, he took a concubine in Shechem. She bore him a son, and he named him Abimelech.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">Gideon son of Joash died at a ripe old age and was buried in the tomb of his father Joash, at Ophrah, a town of the clan of Abiezer.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">No sooner had Gideon died than the Israelites again abandoned the true God and worshiped the images of Baal. They made Baal-Berith their god</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">and no longer remembered Yahweh their God, who had saved them from all their enemies on every side.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">The Israelites failed to demonstrate loyal love to the family of Gideon, the Baal-Fighter, for all the good that he had done for them.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="9">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Abimelech son of Baal-Fighter ( or Gideon ) went to his mother&amp;quot;s brothers and to the rest of her clan in Shechem and said to them,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">&amp;apos;Ask all the leaders of Shechem, &amp;quot;Which do you prefer: to have just one man as your ruler or have seventy of Baal-Fighter&amp;quot;s sons rule over you?&amp;quot; And don&amp;quot;t forget, I&amp;quot;m your own flesh and blood.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">When the brothers repeated these words to the leaders of Shechem, their hearts were drawn to Abimelech, for they said, &amp;apos;He is from our hometown and from our own clan.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">They gave him seventy shekels of silver from the temple of Baal-Berith, and Abimelech used it to hire reckless scoundrels to follow him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">He went to his father&amp;quot;s home in Ophrah and on one stone executed his seventy brothers, the sons of Baal-Fighter. Jotham, Baal-Fighter&amp;quot;s youngest son, escaped and went into hiding.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">All the citizens of Shechem and Beth Millo gathered beside the sacred tree at the pillar in Shechem and crowned Abimelech king.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">When Jotham learned about this, he climbed up on the top of Mount Gerizim and shouted: &amp;apos;Listen to me, citizens of Shechem, so that God may listen to you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">All the trees one day determined to anoint a king for themselves. They said to the olive tree, &amp;quot;Be our king.&amp;quot;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">&amp;apos;But the olive tree answered, &amp;quot;What? Give up my rich oil that is used to honor both gods and men, to hold sway over the trees?&amp;quot;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">&amp;apos;Next, the trees said to the fig tree, &amp;quot;Come and be our king.&amp;quot;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">&amp;apos;But the fig tree replied, &amp;quot;What? Give up my good, sweet fruit to hold sway over the trees?&amp;quot;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">&amp;apos;Then the trees said to the vine, &amp;quot;Come and be our king.&amp;quot;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">&amp;apos;But the vine answered, &amp;quot;What? Give up my wine, which cheers both gods and men, to hold sway over the trees?&amp;quot;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">&amp;apos;Finally, all the trees said to the thornbush, &amp;quot;Come and be our king.&amp;quot;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">&amp;apos;The thornbush replied, &amp;quot;If you really want to anoint me your king, then come and put your trust in my shade. If you don&amp;quot;t, then let fire blaze out of my thorny branches and consume the cedars of Lebanon!&amp;quot;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">&amp;apos;Now then let me ask you this: Do you really think you did a right and honorable thing when you made Abimelech king? Do you think you treated Baal-Fighter and his family fairly?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">And to think that my father fought for you, and risked his life to save you from the power of the Midianites!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Today, you have revolted against my father&amp;quot;s family, murdered his seventy sons on a single stone, and made Abimelech, the son of his slave girl, king over the citizens of Shechem because he&amp;quot;s your close relative.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">What were you thinking? If you have acted honorably and done what is right by Baal-Fighter and his family today, then may you enjoy Abimelech, this thornbush king of yours , and may he enjoy you too!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">But if not, let fire come out from Abimelech and consume you, citizens of Shechem and Beth Millo, and let fire come out from you, citizens of Shechem and Beth Millo, and consume Abimelech!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">After shouting these words, Jotham ran away and went to live at the Well because he was afraid of his brother Abimelech.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">After Abimelech had ruled Israel for three years,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">God sent a spirit to stir up hostility between Abimelech and the citizens of Shechem, and they rebelled against him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">God sent this judgment in order to avenge the brutal murder of Baal-Fighter&amp;quot;s seventy sons and the shedding of their blood. Righteous retribution caught up with both Abimelech, who had instigated the murder of his half brothers, and the citizens of Shechem, who had aided and abetted him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">In their uprising against Abimelech, the citizens of Shechem placed bandits on the hilltops to ambush and rob everyone who passed by, and Abimelech heard of their treachery.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">One day, a man named Gaal son of Ebed moved with his clan into Shechem, and Gaal won the confidence of the people.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">After the grape harvest, they trod the grapes and celebrated a festival in the temple of Baal , their god. While they were drinking and feasting, they cursed Abimelech.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">Gaal son of Ebed rose and said, &amp;apos;Who is this Abimelech? We are the Shechemites now! Why should we serve him? Isn&amp;quot;t he Baal-Fighter&amp;quot;s son, and isn&amp;quot;t the governor of our city Zebul his deputy? Why should we take orders from him; we are descendants of Hamor, Shechem&amp;quot;s founder. Why should we be slaves of Abimelech?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">If only the people of Shechem were under my command, then I would get rid of him. I would say to Abimelech, &amp;quot;Assemble your whole army! We&amp;quot;ll defeat them all! &amp;quot; &amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">Zebul, the governor of the city, was infuriated when he heard of the taunts of Gaal son of Ebed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">He secretly sent messengers to Abimelech, saying, &amp;apos;Gaal son of Ebed and his clan have come to Shechem. They&amp;quot;re inciting the entire city against you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">Now then, under the cover of darkness, you and your men should come and take up concealed positions in the fields.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">At sunrise launch your surprise attack and advance against the city. When Gaal and his men come out to face you, fight them with all of your might.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">So Abimelech and all his men set out by night and took up concealed positions near Shechem in four groups.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">Gaal son of Ebed went out and stood in the entrance of the gate of the city just as Abimelech and his soldiers got up from their hiding places.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">When Gaal saw them, he said to Zebul, &amp;apos;Look, an army is marching down from the hilltops!&amp;apos; Zebul replied, &amp;apos;That&amp;quot;s nothing but shadows in the hills; they only look like men.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">Gaal spoke up again: &amp;apos;No, look! I see people coming down the center, and another group from the direction of Oracle Oak.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">Then Zebul said to him, &amp;apos;Where is all your big talk now? Weren&amp;quot;t you the loudmouth who said, &amp;quot;Who is Abimelech that he could make us his slaves?&amp;quot; The men you ridiculed are now coming to fight you! Go ahead&amp;ndash;go and fight them!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">So Gaal led the men of Shechem and went out to fight Abimelech.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">Abimelech chased him, and many Shechemites fell wounded and died before they could retreat to the city gate.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">Abimelech returned to his headquarters at Arumah, while Zebul drove Gaal and his clan out of Shechem.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">The next day Abimelech found out that the people of Shechem were planning to go out on a foray into the countryside.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43">So he divided his men into three groups, and they set out to ambush the Shechemites in the fields. As soon as Abimelech saw the people leaving the city, he sprang up and attacked them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44">Abimelech and his men advanced rapidly and occupied the city gate. The other two companies chased them down out into the open fields and killed them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45">Abimelech fought hard all day at the gate of Shechem until he had captured the city. He massacred all its people, leveled the city to rubble, and scattered salt over it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46">When they heard the news, the leading citizens living in the Shechem Tower ran into the stronghold of the temple of Baal-Berith.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="47">When Abimelech heard that they had assembled there,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="48">he and all his forces went up Mount Zalmon. Taking an axe in his hand, he cut off some branches and hoisted the bundle onto his shoulders. He ordered the men with him, &amp;apos;Quick! Do the same!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="49">So each one cut a bundle of branches and followed Abimelech. They piled them against the walls of the temple and with the people inside they set it on fire. So everyone who fled into the tower of Shechem died; nearly a thousand men and women perished.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="50">Next, Abimelech attacked the city of Thebez and captured it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="51">All the people had fled to the Tower of Strength in the middle of the city. They locked themselves in and climbed up onto the tower roof.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="52">Abimelech advanced as far as the tower, stormed it, and set it on fire.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="53">But a woman dropped a millstone on his head and fractured his skull.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="54">Abimelech cried out to his armor-bearer, &amp;apos;Kill me with your sword so no one can say I was killed by a woman.&amp;apos; So his servant ran him through, and he died.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="55">When the Israelites saw that Abimelech was dead, everyone went home.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="56">God avenged the evil that Abimelech had done to his father by murdering his seventy brothers.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="57">God also punished the Shechemites for all their wickedness. That day , the curse of Jotham son of Baal-Fighter was fulfilled.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1">After Abimelech died, Yahweh raised up a man of Issachar&amp;quot;s tribe to deliver Israel. His name was Tola son of Puah and grandson of Dodo. He lived in the village of Shamir in the highlands of Ephraim.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">He was Israel&amp;quot;s champion-deliverer for twenty-three years; then he died and was buried at Shamir.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">After Tola, Yahweh raised up a man from Gilead whose name was Jair. He was Israel&amp;quot;s champion-deliverer for twenty-two years.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">He had thirty sons, who rode on thirty donkeys, and thirty villages belonged to them. These villages are in the region of Gilead and are called Jair&amp;quot;s Villages to this day.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Jair died and was buried at Kamon.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">The Israelites again did evil in the sight of Yahweh , worshiping the Baals and the Ashtaroths, the gods of Aram, Sidon, Moab, and Ammon, and the gods of the Philistines. Because Israel entirely abandoned the worship of Yahweh ,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Yahweh became furious with Israel, and he handed them over to the oppression of the Philistines and the Ammonites.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">They crushed and oppressed all the Israelites for eighteen years. They ruled over all the Israelites living east of the Jordan in Gilead, in the land of the Amorites.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">The Ammonites also crossed the Jordan and fought against the tribes of Judah, Benjamin, and Ephraim, leaving Israel distressed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Then the Israelites desperately cried out to Yahweh , &amp;apos;We have sinned against you because we have abandoned our God and have worshiped the Baals.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Yahweh answered them, &amp;apos;Did I not rescue you in the past from the power of the Egyptians, the Amorites, the Ammonites, the Philistines,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">the Sidonians, the Amalekites, and the Midianites? When they swept over you and oppressed you and when you cried out in desperation to me, did I not deliver you and set you free from their power?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Because you have abandoned me to serve false gods, I am no longer coming to your rescue!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Go ahead and pray all you want to these new gods you have chosen. Let&amp;quot;s see if they will come and deliver you in your time of trouble!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">But the Israelites continued to plead with Yahweh , &amp;apos;Rescue us! We know we are guilty. You can do to us whatever seems good to you, but please , come to our rescue!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">So they threw away the false gods from among them and returned to worshiping Yahweh . At last , Yahweh felt Israel&amp;quot;s misery and could bear it no longer.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Then the Ammonites mustered an army and encamped in Gilead, while the Israelites rallied together, and they encamped at Mizpah.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">The commanders of the people of Gilead said to one another, &amp;apos;Whoever starts the fight against the Ammonites, we&amp;quot;ll make him our leader.&amp;apos;</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="11">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Yahweh raised up a brave, fearless champion from Gilead to deliver Israel. His name was Jephthah, and he was the son of a prostitute. His father Gilead</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">had other sons by his wife, and when they grew up, they forced Jephthah to leave home. They said to him, &amp;apos;You will inherit nothing of our father&amp;quot;s wealth because you are the son of another woman.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Jephthah fled from his half brothers and lived in the land of Tob. There he recruited a gang of lawless mercenaries who traveled around with him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Sometime later, the Ammonites waged war against Israel.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">When they attacked Israel, the leaders of Gilead went to the land of Tob to find Jephthah and to bring him back from exile.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Swallowing their pride , they said to him, &amp;apos;Come and lead us so that we can fight the Ammonites.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Jephthah answered, &amp;apos;You&amp;quot;re the very people who hated me so much that you kicked me out of my father&amp;quot;s house. Why are you coming to me now that you&amp;quot;re in trouble?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">They said to Jephthah, &amp;apos;We&amp;quot;re turning to you now because we want you to lead us in battle. Come and fight the Ammonites. You&amp;quot;re the one we need! &amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Jephthah said to them, &amp;apos; Very well . If you take me back home to fight the Ammonites and Yahweh gives me victory, then you will make me your ruler. Agreed?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">&amp;apos;That&amp;quot;s right,&amp;apos; they replied. &amp;apos;With Yahweh as our witness, we pledge our loyalty to you.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">So Jephthah returned home with the leaders of Gilead, and the people made him their commander and ruler. Jephthah stated his terms in a solemn ceremony at Mizpah in the presence of Yahweh .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Then Jephthah sent messengers to the king of Ammon to ask, &amp;apos;What is your quarrel with us? Why have you invaded our country?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">The king of Ammon answered Jephthah&amp;quot;s messengers, &amp;apos;When the Israelites came out of Egypt, they seized my land from the River Arnon to the River Jabbok, as far as the River Jordan. Now give it all back, and we&amp;quot;ll be at peace.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Jephthah again sent messengers back to the king of Ammon</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">with this answer: &amp;apos;Israel seized neither the land of Moab nor the land of Ammon.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">When the Israelites left Egypt, they passed through the desert to the Red Sea and came to Kadesh.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">They sent messengers to the king of Edom requesting permission to go through his land, but the king of Edom refused. They also asked the king of Moab, but he too would not cooperate. So the Israelites were forced to remain at Kadesh.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Leaving from there, they traveled through the desert in order to bypass the land of Edom and the land of Moab. When they arrived at the east side of Moab, on the other side of the River Arnon, they made camp there, but they did not cross the Arnon because it was Moab&amp;quot;s boundary.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Then, the Israelites dispatched messengers to Sihon, the Amorite king of Heshbon, and requested his permission to go through his country to their own land.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Because Sihon did not trust Israel, he assembled his whole army, made camp at Jahaz, and attacked Israel.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">But Yahweh , the mighty God of Israel, gave the Israelites victory over Sihon and his army. So the Israelites took possession of all the territory of the Amorites who lived in that land.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Then they occupied all the Amorite territory from the Arnon in the south to the Jabbok in the north and from the desert in the east to the Jordan in the west.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">Since it was Yahweh the mighty God of Israel who drove out the Amorites for his people, the Israelites,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">who do you think you are to try to take it back? You should be satisfied with whatever land your god Chemosh has won for himself, but we are going to keep everything that Yahweh our mighty God has given us.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">Do you think you&amp;quot;re stronger than Moab&amp;quot;s king Balak son of Zippor? He never challenged Israel over disputed land, did he? Did he ever go to war against us?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">For three hundred years, Israel has been living here and occupying Heshbon, Aroer, and the towns around them, and all the cities on the banks of the Arnon River. Why have you waited until now to try to take them back?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">No, I have not wronged you; rather, you are doing me wrong by attacking me. Let Yahweh be the judge, and let him decide today which of us is right, Israel or Ammon.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">But the king of Ammon ignored Jephthah&amp;quot;s message.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">Then the Spirit of Yahweh rushed upon Jephthah and empowered him . He and his men marched through Gilead and Manasseh and returned to Mizpah in Gilead, and from there, he stalked the Ammonites.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">Jephthah promised Yahweh : &amp;apos;If you give me victory over the Ammonites,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">I will offer up to you as a burnt offering the first thing that comes out of my house to greet me when I return in victory. I will sacrifice that one as an offering to you.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">So Jephthah crossed the river with his men to fight the Ammonites, and Yahweh gave him victory.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">He struck at them from Aroer to the area near Minnith, twenty villages in all, and as far as Abel Keramim. The Israelites brought the Ammonites down to the dust in a great slaughter.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">When Jephthah arrived home at Mizpah, his daughter came hurrying out of the house to welcome her father home, dancing to the rhythm of tambourines. She was his only child&amp;ndash;his one and only.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">When he realized who had come out, he ripped his cloak and was overcome with grief. He exclaimed, &amp;apos;Oh no! My dearest daughter, you have torn my heart to shreds! Must it be you I offer? I have made a solemn promise to Yahweh , and I cannot retract it!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">She said to him, &amp;apos;My father, you have made a vow to Yahweh and he has delivered you from your enemies, the Ammonites. Do to me what you promised him you would do.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">But please grant me one thing. Spare me for two months and let me go with my friends to grieve. Let me be free to wander on the hills and to lament my sad fate.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">&amp;apos;Go,&amp;apos; he replied, and he sent her away for two months. She and her friends went into the mountains and grieved because she was going to die unmarried and childless.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">After two months, she returned to her father, and Jephthah fulfilled his vow to Yahweh . His daughter died still a virgin. (This was the origin of the custom in Israel</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">that young women would go away each year to grieve and lament for the daughter of Jephthah of Gilead.)</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="12">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Jephthah&amp;quot;s actions grievously offended the men of Ephraim. They assembled their forces and crossed the Jordan River to Zaphon to confront Jephthah . They said to him, &amp;apos;Why did you cross the border to fight the Ammonites without inviting us to join you? We&amp;quot;re going to burn your house down over your head!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Jephthah replied, &amp;apos;I and my people were in the middle of a serious conflict with the Ammonites. I summoned you, but you ignored me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">When I realized that you were not coming to help us, I risked my own life to cross the border to fight them. Yahweh empowered me to be victorious over them. So why are you coming to fight with me now?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Then Jephthah gathered all the men of Gilead and fought the men of Ephraim. The men of Gilead defeated them, for the Ephraimites insulted them, saying, &amp;apos;You men of Gilead are nothing but renegades from Ephraim and Manasseh!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">In order to keep the Ephraimites from escaping, the men of Gilead captured the places where they could cross the Jordan. When any Ephraimite tried to escape and asked permission to cross the river, the men of Gilead would ask, &amp;apos;Are you an Ephraimite?&amp;apos; If he said, &amp;apos;No,&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">they would tell him to say &amp;apos;Shibboleth.&amp;apos; But if he could not pronounce it correctly and said &amp;apos;Sibboleth,&amp;apos; the men of Gilead would seize him and kill him there at the crossing place of the Jordan. At that time, they killed forty-two thousand Ephraimites.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Jephthah ruled Israel for six years. When he died, they buried him in his hometown in Gilead.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">After Jephthah, Yahweh raised up Ibzan, a champion-deliverer from Bethlehem who ruled Israel.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">He had thirty sons and thirty daughters. He gave his thirty daughters in marriage outside his tribe and brought thirty women from outside the tribe as wives for his sons. Ibzan ruled Israel for seven years.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">When he died, they buried him at Bethlehem.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">After Ibzan, Yahweh raised up Elon, a champion-deliverer from Zebulun, who ruled Israel for ten years.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">When he died, they buried him at Aijalon in the territory of Zebulun.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">After Elon, Yahweh raised up Abdon son of Hillel, a champion-deliverer from Pirathon, to rule Israel.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">He had forty sons and thirty grandsons, who rode on seventy donkeys. Abdon led Israel for eight years.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">When he died, they buried him at Pirathon in the territory of Ephraim in the hill country of the Amalekites.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="13">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Once again, the Israelites continued doing evil in the sight of Yahweh , so he subjected them to Philistine rule for forty years.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">There was a certain man from the tribe of Dan, who lived in the city of Zorah, named Manoah. His wife was barren and childless,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">but the Angel of Yahweh appeared to her and said, &amp;apos;Look here! You are no longer barren and childless, for you will conceive and give birth to a son.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Now be careful not to drink any wine or beer and to eat nothing considered unclean.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">You will conceive and will give birth to a son. Raise the boy as one dedicated to God from the womb and never cut his hair. He will begin to deliver Israel from Philistine power.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">So Manoah&amp;quot;s wife went to her husband and said, &amp;apos;A man sent from God came to me! He looked like an angel of God&amp;ndash;incredibly awesome. I didn&amp;quot;t ask where he came from, and he didn&amp;quot;t tell me his name,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">but he told me, &amp;quot;You will become pregnant, and you will have a son. Make sure you don&amp;quot;t drink any wine or beer, and eat nothing unclean, for the boy will be fully devoted to God from the womb to the day he dies!&amp;quot; &amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Manoah pleaded with Yahweh , &amp;apos;O my Lord, please send the man of God back to us. Have him come to instruct us how to raise the son who is to be born.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">God answered Manoah&amp;quot;s prayer and sent the Angel of God to the woman again while she was sitting alone in the field. Her husband Manoah was not with her</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">so she ran at once to tell him the news: &amp;apos;Look! Come quickly! He reappeared&amp;ndash;the same man who came to me that day!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">So Manoah got up, followed his wife, and went to the man. Manoah said to him, &amp;apos;Are you the man who appeared and spoke to my wife?&amp;apos; &amp;apos;I am,&amp;apos; he said. But his wife said, &amp;apos;If Yahweh had planned to kill us, he wouldn&amp;quot;t have accepted our burnt offering and our grain offering. He wouldn&amp;quot;t have revealed all these things to us or have spoken to us as he did just now.&amp;apos; And Manoah and his wife never encountered Yahweh &amp;quot;s Angel again.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Manoah replied, &amp;apos;Well, when Yahweh fulfills your prophecy, how should we raise the boy, and what is his life mission?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">The Angel of Yahweh answered, &amp;apos;Do everything that I instructed your wife.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">She must abstain from anything that comes from the grapevine and drink no alcohol, nor should she eat anything unclean. She must do all that I have commanded her.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Manoah said to the Angel of Yahweh , &amp;apos;Please stay here until we cook a young goat for you.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">The Angel of Yahweh said to Manoah, &amp;apos;Even if you detain me, I will not eat your food. But if you want to prepare a burnt offering, offer it up to Yahweh .&amp;apos; Manoah did not realize that he was speaking with the Angel of Yahweh .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Stunned , Manoah asked the Angel of Yahweh . &amp;apos;What is your name? When Yahweh fulfills your prophecy, we want to honor you!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">The Angel of Yahweh replied, &amp;apos;Why ask for my name? It is &amp;quot;Wonderfully Hidden!&amp;quot; &amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">So Manoah prepared the young goat and his grain offering and took them to the rock to offer them up to Yahweh , the wonder-working God . While Manoah and his wife watched,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">flames burst from the rock and ascended upward to heaven from the altar. The Angel of Yahweh , wrapped in the flames of fire, ascended into the sky. Dazed, Manoah and his wife fell facedown to the ground in worship .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">Manoah&amp;quot;s wife gave birth to a son, and she named him Samson. The boy grew up with Yahweh &amp;quot;s blessing on his life.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">The Spirit of Yahweh began to stir his heart while he was between Zorah and Eshtaol, in the Camp of Dan.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="14">
			<VERS vnumber="1">One day Samson went down to Timnah where a Philistine girl caught his eye,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">so he returned home and told his parents, &amp;apos;At Timnah I noticed a young woman among the daughters of the Philistines; get her for me now to be my wife.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">His parents replied, &amp;apos;Why can&amp;quot;t you find a woman from among our relatives, or at least from our tribe? You don&amp;quot;t have to get a wife from the uncircumcised Philistines.&amp;apos; But Samson told his father, &amp;apos;Get her for me; I know she&amp;quot;s the right one for me.&amp;apos; &amp;apos;Ask away,&amp;apos; they said to him. &amp;apos;Let&amp;quot;s hear your riddle.&amp;apos; &amp;apos;From the eater came something to eat, From the strong came something sweet.&amp;apos; After three days, they were still stumped and could not figure it out. &amp;apos;Listen,&amp;apos; he said to her. &amp;apos;I haven&amp;quot;t even told my parents. So why should I tell you?&amp;apos; &amp;apos;What could be sweeter than honey? And what is stronger than a lion?&amp;apos; And Samson angrily replied, &amp;apos;If you hadn&amp;quot;t used my cow for your plow you wouldn&amp;quot;t know my riddle now!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Now, his parents had no idea that Samson&amp;quot;s passion for the girl was part of Yahweh &amp;quot;s plan to create an opportunity to come against the Philistines who ruled over Israel at that time.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">One day, Samson decided to go back to Timnah to visit the Philistine woman . As he was approaching the vineyards of Timnah, a full-grown lion suddenly came roaring toward him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">The Spirit of Yahweh entered Samson and empowered him to tear the lion to pieces with his bare hands as if it were a young goat! But he never disclosed to his father and mother what he had done.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Afterward, he went into Timnah and talked with the Philistine woman, because Samson was convinced that she was the right one for him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Later, Samson returned to marry her. On his way there, he turned aside to look at the lion&amp;quot;s remains, and to his surprise, there was a swarm of bees, honey, and honeycomb in the carcass of the lion!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">He scooped some of the honey into his hands and continued on his way, eating as he went. When he rejoined his father and mother, he gave some to them, and they ate too. But he did not tell them he had scooped it from the lion&amp;quot;s carcass.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">So Samson&amp;quot;s father accompanied him to Timnah to arrange the marriage. Following the custom for young men about to marry, Samson threw a party that lasted for seven days.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">When the Philistines saw him, they arranged for thirty Philistine men to accompany him as groomsmen .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Samson challenged them with a riddle, &amp;apos;Hey, I have a riddle for you. If you can solve my riddle within the seven days of our feast, then I will give each of you a linen garment and a set of fine clothing.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">But if you cannot solve it, then you must give me thirty linen garments and thirty sets of fine clothing.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">He said to them:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">On the fourth day, they said to Samson&amp;quot;s bride, &amp;apos;Have you invited us here to bankrupt us? Do whatever it takes to persuade your husband to tell you the answer to his riddle, or we will burn down your father&amp;quot;s house with you and your family inside!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">So Samson&amp;quot;s bride went to him and turned on the tears and sobbed, &amp;apos;Honey, you don&amp;quot;t really love me! You hate me! You&amp;quot;ve challenged my countrymen with a riddle, but you haven&amp;quot;t told me its meaning !&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">She continued to cry on his shoulder for the remaining days of their feast, and on the seventh day, because she had so persistently nagged him, he finally gave in and divulged the secret. Then she went and explained the riddle to her countrymen.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">On the seventh day before the sun had set, the townsmen answered him:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Then suddenly, the Spirit of Yahweh rushed upon Samson, infusing him with power! He went down to Ashkelon and killed thirty of their men. He stripped them of their linen tunics and their robes and gave them in payment to those who had explained the riddle. Then, in a blazing fury, he returned to his father&amp;quot;s house.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Meanwhile, unknown to Samson, his bride married his best man.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="15">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Later, during the wheat harvest, Samson went to visit his wife and took a young goat as a gift for her. He said to her father , &amp;apos;I&amp;quot;m going into my wife&amp;quot;s bedroom to sleep with her.&amp;apos; But her father wouldn&amp;quot;t let him enter. He said to Samson,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">&amp;apos;I thought you really despised her and had divorced her, so I gave her to your best man. Look, her younger sister is even more beautiful than she. Take her instead.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Samson said, &amp;apos;That does it! This time I&amp;quot;ll settle my score with you Philistines for good!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Samson went out and caught three hundred foxes, tied their tails together in pairs, and lashed a torch between each pair of tails.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">He lit the torches and set the foxes loose in the grain fields of the Philistines, burning all their grain to the ground, including the sheaves and the standing grain, as well as their vineyards and olive groves.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">&amp;apos;Who did this?&amp;apos; the Philistines demanded. &amp;apos;Samson,&amp;apos; someone told them, &amp;apos;because his father-in-law from Timnah gave Samson&amp;quot;s bride to his best man.&amp;apos; So the Philistines went and burned both the woman and her father to death. The Philistines replied, &amp;apos;We&amp;quot;ve come to capture Samson and repay him for what he did to us.&amp;apos; Samson replied, &amp;apos;I only did to them what they did to me.&amp;apos; &amp;apos;All right,&amp;apos; Samson said, &amp;apos;but promise me that you won&amp;quot;t kill me.&amp;apos; &amp;apos;With only a donkey&amp;quot;s jawbone, With only a donkey&amp;quot;s jawbone, a thousand men lie slain!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">&amp;apos;Because you did this despicable act,&amp;apos; Samson vowed, &amp;apos;I won&amp;quot;t rest until I get even with you!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">He was so furious that he launched a vicious attack on the Philistines and single handedly slaughtered many of them. Afterward, he went and hid in a cave in the cliff of Etam.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">The Philistines retaliated by setting up camp in Judah and deploying their men near the town of Lehi.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">The men of Judah asked the Philistines, &amp;apos;Why are you coming against us?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">So three thousand men of Judah went to Samson&amp;quot;s cave in the cliff of Etam, and they said to him, &amp;apos;What are you trying to do to us? Don&amp;quot;t you realize the Philistines rule over us?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">The men of Judah told him, &amp;apos;We&amp;quot;ve come to take you prisoner and hand you over to the Philistines.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">&amp;apos;We promise not to kill you,&amp;apos; they replied. &amp;apos;We&amp;quot;ll only tie you up and hand you over to the Philistines.&amp;apos; They bound him with two brand new ropes and led him from the cave near the cliff of Etam to Lehi .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">When the Philistines saw Samson coming, they raised a shout of triumph. Immediately, the mighty Spirit of Yahweh came rushing upon Samson! He snapped the ropes off his arms as if they were strings catching fire, and they fell from his wrists.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">He spotted a raw jawbone of a donkey lying there on the ground and picked it up. He began to swing it wildly and used it to kill a thousand Philistines that day.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Samson then said, I made heaps of donkeys out of them!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">When he finished boasting, he threw the jawbone to the ground. That&amp;quot;s how the place got its name&amp;ndash;Jawbone Hill.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Afterward, Samson was terribly thirsty and cried out to Yahweh , &amp;apos;I was strengthened by your great power to win this awesome victory. Will you now leave me here dying of thirst&amp;ndash;and let me fall into the hands of these pagans?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">So God answered Samson&amp;quot;s prayer and split open the rock basin under Lehi , and water gushed out! Samson drank and his spirit was revived. He named that place &amp;apos;The Spring for the One Who Cried,&amp;apos; and it is still there in Lehi to this day.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Samson led Israel as its champion-deliverer for twenty years during the period of Philistine oppression.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="16">
			<VERS vnumber="1">One day, Samson went to Gaza, a Philistine town, and slept with a prostitute there.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Word soon spread that Samson was in town, so the men of Gaza gathered and hid at the town gates, cutting off his escape . They made no move during the night, saying, &amp;apos;We&amp;quot;ll kill him at dawn when he tries to leave.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">But in the middle of the night, Samson got up and left. On his way out of Gaza, he took hold of the doors of the town gate and ripped them off their hinges&amp;ndash;two posts, the gates, and the locking bar. He hoisted them all on his shoulders and carried them off a great distance to the top of the hill across from Hebron.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Some time later Samson fell in love with a woman named Delilah from the Sorek Valley.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">The rulers of the Philistines went to her with a plan : &amp;apos;Trick Samson into telling you the secret of his great strength. Find out how we can subdue him. We&amp;quot;ll tie him up and make him helpless. Then each of us will give you eleven hundred pieces of silver.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">So Delilah approached Samson and asked, &amp;apos;Please dear, won&amp;quot;t you tell me the secret of your strength and how you could be tied up and made helpless?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Samson replied, &amp;apos;If someone bound me with seven new bowstrings that haven&amp;quot;t been dried, I&amp;quot;ll become as weak as an ordinary man.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">So the Philistine tyrants brought Delilah seven new bowstrings, and she tied Samson up with them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">With men waiting in ambush in one of the inner rooms of her house, she cried out, &amp;apos;Samson! The Philistines are here to capture you!&amp;apos; But Samson snapped the bowstrings like a piece of string snaps when it is burned by a fire. So no one discovered the secret of his strength.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Afterward, Delilah said to him, &amp;apos;You&amp;quot;ve made fun of me and told me lies! Please tell me how you can be tied up securely.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Samson replied, &amp;apos;If someone bound me with brand-new ropes that have never been used, I&amp;quot;ll become as weak as anyone else.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">So Delilah took new ropes and tied him up with them, and the men were waiting in ambush in the inner room as before. Delilah cried out, &amp;apos;Samson! The Philistines are here to capture you!&amp;apos; Once again, Samson easily snapped the ropes from his arms like they were threads.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Delilah reprimanded him, saying, &amp;apos;You&amp;quot;ve made a fool of me and lied to me again! Now tell me the truth&amp;ndash;how can you be tied up?&amp;apos; Samson replied, &amp;apos;If you weave the seven braids of my hair into the fabric on your loom and tighten it with the pin, I&amp;quot;ll become as weak as anyone else.&amp;apos; So while he slept, Delilah wove the seven braids of his hair into the fabric He woke up and thought, &amp;apos;I&amp;quot;ll do the same as before and shake myself free.&amp;apos; But he didn&amp;quot;t realize that Yahweh had turned away from him. &amp;apos;Our god has given us victory! Dagon has subdued our strong enemy Samson!&amp;apos; &amp;apos;Our god has delivered our enemy to us! The one who devastated our country and piled our corpses high!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">and pinned it with a peg. Again she cried out, &amp;apos;Samson! The Philistines are here to capture you!&amp;apos; But Samson woke up and yanked his hair from both the loom and the fabric.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">&amp;apos;How can you say, &amp;quot;I love you,&amp;quot; &amp;apos; pouted Delilah, &amp;apos;and yet you don&amp;quot;t tell me your secrets? You&amp;quot;ve tricked me three times now, and you still haven&amp;quot;t told me what makes you so strong!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">She tormented him day after day until he was sick to death of her nagging.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Finally, he confessed to her everything: &amp;apos;I&amp;quot;ve never had my hair cut, because my parents dedicated me to God from birth. If anyone cuts my hair, my power will leave me, and I&amp;quot;ll become as weak as anyone else.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">When Delilah realized he had finally disclosed his secret, she sent for the Philistine rulers. &amp;apos;Come quickly!&amp;apos; she said. &amp;apos;He&amp;quot;s finally told me his secret!&amp;apos; So the Philistine rulers returned with the bribe money in their hands.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Delilah lulled Samson to sleep with his head in her lap. Then she called in a barber to cut off the seven locks of his hair. In this way she weakened him, and his strength drained from him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Then she cried out, &amp;apos;Samson! The Philistines have come to capture you!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">So the Philistines captured him and gouged out his eyes. They took him down to Gaza, where they bound him with bronze chains and forced him to grind grain in the prison.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">But before long , his hair began to grow back.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">One day, the Philistine tyrants celebrated a great festival to offer extravagant sacrifices to their god, Dagon. They praised Dagon, saying,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">When the people saw their idol, they too joined in the praises, saying,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">By now, the people were getting drunk and demanded, &amp;apos;Bring out Samson and let him dance for us!&amp;apos; So he was brought from the prison to amuse them, and they displayed him between the main pillars that supported their temple .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">Blind Samson said to the young servant who was leading him by the hand, &amp;apos;Let go of me and let me feel the pillars that hold up the temple. I want to lean against them.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">The temple was completely packed with people. All the Philistine rulers were there, and there were some three thousand men and women in the balcony watching as Samson provided them some amusement.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">Then Samson prayed to Yahweh , &amp;apos;Lord Yahweh , please remember me again. O God, impart your strength to me just one more time. With one blow let me take revenge on the Philistines for gouging out my eyes.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">Then his brothers and entire family went down to Gaza to get his body. They brought him back home and buried him between Zorah and Eshtaol, next to his father, Manoah. Samson had led Israel for twenty years.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="17">
			<VERS vnumber="1">There was a man named Micah from the hill country of Ephraim.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">He said to his mother, &amp;apos;When someone stole your eleven hundred shekels of silver, I overheard you speak a curse over the thief. Well, it turns out , I have the money. I&amp;quot;m the one who took it. Here&amp;ndash;I&amp;quot;m bringing it back .&amp;apos; Immediately, his mother, wanting to revoke her curse , said: &amp;apos;O my son! May Yahweh bless you!&amp;apos; &amp;apos;I&amp;quot;m a Levite from Bethlehem in Judah,&amp;apos; he said, &amp;apos;and I&amp;quot;m looking for a place to live.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">So he returned the eleven hundred shekels of silver to his mother, but she said to him, &amp;apos;I give it back to you, for I solemnly dedicate this silver to Yahweh for my son to make a carved image, an idol covered with silver.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">So from the silver he returned to his mother, she took two hundred shekels of silver and gave them to a silversmith, who molded them into an idol and overlaid the idol with silver. Micah kept the idol in his house.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Now Micah had a shrine, and he made some idols and a counterfeit ephod and ordained one of his sons as his priest.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">In those days, Israel had no king. People did whatever they wanted to do.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">At the same time, there was a young man from the priestly tribe of Levi living in Bethlehem in Judah.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">He left there to search for another place to live. On his journey, he came to Micah&amp;quot;s house in the hill country of Ephraim.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Micah asked him, &amp;apos;Where are you from?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">&amp;apos;Live here with me,&amp;apos; Micah said to him. &amp;apos;Be my father and priest, and I&amp;quot;ll pay you ten shekels of silver a year and provide your clothes and your food.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">So the Levite agreed to move in with him and the young man became like one of his sons.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Then Micah ordained the young Levite as his priest, and he lived in his house.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">And Micah declared, &amp;apos;Now I know that Yahweh will bless me and prosper me, since a Levite now serves as my priest.&amp;apos;</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="18">
			<VERS vnumber="1">In those days there was no king in Israel, and the tribe of Dan sought a territory to settle in. They still had no place to call their own among the tribes of Israel.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">So the Danites sent out from Zorah and from Eshtaol five of their valiant men to spy out the land, telling them, &amp;apos;Go, explore the land.&amp;apos; When they advanced to the hill country of Ephraim, they got as far as Micah&amp;quot;s house and camped near there.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">When they approached Micah&amp;quot;s house, they recognized the voice of the young Levite, so they went over to him and asked, &amp;apos;Why are you here? Who brought you here? What are you doing in this place?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">He replied, &amp;apos;Micah helped me. He hired me, and I&amp;quot;ve become his priest.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Then they said to him, &amp;apos;Good! Please pray to God for us and find out if our mission will succeed.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">The priest replied, &amp;apos;You have nothing to worry about. The eyes of Yahweh are watching over your mission. You will succeed .&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">So the five spies went northward and came to Laish. They observed that the people were wealthy and living in security, after the manner of the Sidonians. Their quiet and carefree community lacked nothing. Furthermore, they lived far from the Sidonians and had no dealings with anyone, leaving them defenseless.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">When the spies returned to Zorah and Eshtaol from their expedition, they were asked, &amp;apos;What&amp;quot;s your report?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">&amp;apos;Come on, let&amp;quot;s do this!&amp;apos; they replied. &amp;apos;Listen, we&amp;quot;ve seen the land, and it&amp;quot;s very good. Don&amp;quot;t just sit here wasting time ; let&amp;quot;s go quickly and invade the land to conquer and possess it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">When we arrive, we will encounter an unsuspecting people. The land is wide open and fruitful. God has indeed given it into your hand!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">So six hundred Danites, fully armed for war, set out from Zorah and Eshtaol.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">They went up and camped west of Kiriath Jearim in Judah. (To this day that place is called The Camp of Dan.)</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">From there they passed through the hill country of Ephraim until they arrived at the house of Micah.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Then the five men who had explored the region of Laish remarked to their comrades, &amp;apos;Did you know there&amp;quot;s an ephod somewhere in these houses, and other idols and an idol overlaid with silver? So decide what you&amp;quot;ll do about it.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">So they stopped there and came to Micah&amp;quot;s house where the young Levite lived, and they greeted him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">While the six hundred fully armed Danites stationed themselves by the entrance of the gate,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">the five spies proceeded to enter and take the idol overlaid with silver, the ephod, and the other idols. Now the priest was standing with the six hundred fully armed men at the entrance of the gate.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">When he saw the men going into Micah&amp;quot;s house to take the idol overlaid with silver, the ephod, and the other idols, the priest said to them, &amp;apos;What are you doing?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">They said to him, &amp;apos;Be quiet! Don&amp;quot;t say a word, just come with us and be our priest and a father to us all . Isn&amp;quot;t it better for you to be a priest representing an entire tribe of Israel rather than the house of only one man?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">The offer pleased the priest and he accepted. He took all the idols and the ephod and joined the Danites.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">They resumed their journey with their children, their livestock, and their possessions going in front of them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">When they had traveled a considerable distance from Micah&amp;quot;s home, Micah and his neighbors gathered and chased the Danites until they caught up with them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">They shouted at the Danites, who turned around and answered Micah, &amp;apos;What&amp;quot;s your problem? Why have you come against us with such a company?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">He replied, &amp;apos;Why did you take the gods that I made, kidnap my priest, and march off? What&amp;quot;s left for me now? How dare you ask me, &amp;quot;What&amp;quot;s my problem?&amp;quot; &amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">The Danites retorted, &amp;apos;We don&amp;quot;t want to hear any more of your complaints lest some of our hot-tempered men here attack and kill you, your friends , and your household.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">So the Danites went their way. When Micah realized that he was outnumbered, he turned around and went back home.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">The Danites, Micah&amp;quot;s priest, and all that Micah had made, came to Laish, a city of quiet and unsuspecting people. They slaughtered them and burned down their city.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">No one came to their rescue, because Laish was far from Sidon and they had no dealings with Aram. Laish was in the valley that belonged to Beth Rehob. The Danites rebuilt the city and lived in it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">Although the city used to be called Laish, they named the city Dan after their ancestor Dan the Israelite.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">The Danites erected their own idol to worship . Jonathan son of Gershom, son of Moses, and his sons served as priests to the tribe of the Danites until the time the nation went into captivity.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">So they enshrined the idol Micah had made, and they made it their own even though the proper house of God stood at Shiloh.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="19">
			<VERS vnumber="1">These were the days when there was no king ruling in Israel. Now there was a Levite who lived in the remote hill country of Ephraim. He took as his mistress a woman from Bethlehem in Judah,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">but she eventually was unfaithful. She deserted him and returned to her father&amp;quot;s house in Bethlehem where she stayed for four months.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">The Levite set out with his servant and a pair of donkeys to find her, win back her heart, and try to persuade her to return home with him. She received him into her father&amp;quot;s house, and when the girl&amp;quot;s father saw him, he received him warmly.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">His father-in-law, the girl&amp;quot;s father, pressed him to stay, so the Levite stayed with him three days, and they ate and drank together.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">On the fourth day, early in the morning, he started to leave, but his father-in-law, the girl&amp;quot;s father, insisted, &amp;apos;Eat something first to give you strength for your journey ; then you can leave.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">After the two of them sat down and had breakfast together, the girl&amp;quot;s father said to the Levite, &amp;apos;You might as well stay overnight and enjoy yourself.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">The Levite started to leave, but his mistress&amp;quot; father kept urging him to stay until he turned back and spent another night there.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Early in the morning of the fifth day, he was about to leave when the girl&amp;quot;s father said, &amp;apos;Come, have breakfast.&amp;apos; They ate together and lingered there until past noon.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Then the Levite, his mistress, and his attendant started to leave. But his mistress&amp;quot; father said to him, &amp;apos;Look, the day is almost gone; stay another night here and enjoy yourself. Tomorrow, you can start early on your journey and head for home.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">But the Levite refused; he and his two donkeys, his servant, and his mistress set out and traveled as far as the vicinity of Jebus&amp;ndash;that is, Jerusalem.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Late in the day, they were near Jebus, and the servant said to his master, &amp;apos;Let&amp;quot;s go into this town of the Jebusites and spend the night there.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">His master said to him, &amp;apos; No . They are not of Israel. We will not enter a town of foreigners. We will go on to Gibeah.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Come,&amp;apos; he said to his attendant, &amp;apos;we&amp;quot;ll go to another town and spend the night either in Gibeah or in Ramah.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">So they traveled on, and as the sun set, they were near Gibeah in the territory of Benjamin.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">They turned off there and entered Gibeah to spend the night. The Levite, his servant, and his mistress sat down in the town square, but nobody invited them indoors to spend the night.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">In the evening, an old man came into town from working in his field. This man was from the hill country of Ephraim and resided at Gibeah, where the townspeople were of the tribe of Benjamin.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">He happened to see the travelers sitting in the town square. The old man inquired, &amp;apos;Where do you come from? And where are you headed?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">The Levite replied, &amp;apos;We&amp;quot;re just passing through. We&amp;quot;re traveling from Bethlehem in Judah to the other end of the hill country of Ephraim, where I live. I just made a journey to Bethlehem of Judah, and now we&amp;quot;re on our way to the House of Yahweh , but nobody has offered us hospitality.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">We have plenty of straw and feed for our donkeys, and bread and wine for me and the woman and for the attendant with us. All we need is a roof over our heads ; we lack nothing.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">&amp;apos;Rest easy,&amp;apos; said the old man. &amp;apos;I&amp;quot;ll take care of all your needs. You won&amp;quot;t need to spend the night in the square.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">So the old man took them into his house. He prepared fodder for the donkeys; then they washed their feet, and they ate and drank together.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">They were enjoying themselves when suddenly some perverted and depraved men of the town surrounded the house and pounded on the door. They called to the aged owner of the house, &amp;apos;Bring out the man you invited into your house so that we can have sex with him.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">The owner of the house went out to reason with them. &amp;apos;Please, my friends,&amp;apos; he said. &amp;apos;Don&amp;quot;t commit such a wicked act. This man is my guest! Do not perpetrate this outrage.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">Look, here are the man&amp;quot;s mistress and my virgin daughter&amp;ndash;let me bring them out to you. Do what you wish with them. Have your pleasure with them, but don&amp;quot;t do such an outrageous thing to this man.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">But the men refused to listen to him, so the Levite seized his mistress and pushed her out to them. They raped her repeatedly all night until morning and finally let her go when dawn broke.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">At sunrise the woman staggered back to the house where her master had spent the night and collapsed at the entrance of the man&amp;quot;s house.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">When the Levite arose in the morning, he opened the doors of the house to start on his journey, and he saw his mistress lying at the entrance of the house with her hands on the threshold.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">&amp;apos;Get up,&amp;apos; he said to her, &amp;apos;it&amp;quot;s time to go.&amp;apos; But there was no response, for she was dead. The man placed her body on the donkey and set out for home.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">When he arrived home, he took a sword, cut the corpse of his mistress limb by limb into twelve pieces, and sent them, one for each tribe , throughout Israel.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">And everyone who saw this horrible display, cried out, &amp;apos;Never have we seen such brutality take place from the day we came up from the land of Egypt to this day. We need to decide what we should do about this!&amp;apos;</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="20">
			<VERS vnumber="1">The Israelites were united as one man from Dan in the north to Beersheba in the south, including those living in Gilead on the other side of the Jordan. Everyone assembled together before Yahweh at Mizpah.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">All the leaders of all the people from the tribes of Israel presented themselves in the assembly of God&amp;quot;s people, four hundred thousand fighting men armed with swords.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">The Benjamites heard that the Israelites had assembled at Mizpah. The Israelites said to them, &amp;apos;Tell us, how did this evil rape and murder happen?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">The Levite, whose mistress had been murdered, replied, &amp;apos;My mistress and I stopped in Gibeah in the territory of Benjamin to spend the night.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">That night, the depraved men of Gibeah came after me to harm me, gathering around the house in the night where I was staying. They intended to kill me, but instead, they raped my mistress, and she died.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">This deliberate, outrageous act of depravity was committed in Israel! Therefore, I took her body and cut it in pieces and sent the pieces throughout every part of Israel.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Now you Israelites must decide on a response! Let&amp;quot;s do something about it here and now!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Then all the people stood in unison and declared, &amp;apos;None of us will go back to our cities or return to our homes.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">This is what we&amp;quot;re going to do to Gibeah: We&amp;quot;ll cast lots to choose who will fight against it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">And we&amp;quot;ll take a tenth of the men of our tribes of Israel to carry supplies for our forces. When our army arrives at Gibeah in the territory of Benjamin, we&amp;quot;ll give them what they deserve for the outrageous, disgraceful act they committed in Israel.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">So all the men of Israel united as one man to come against Gibeah.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">The Israelite tribes sent couriers throughout the tribe of Benjamin, saying, &amp;apos;What is this brutal crime that you have done?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">We demand that you surrender the depraved perverts from Gibeah who took part in this evil act . We&amp;quot;ll put them to death and purge the evil out of Israel.&amp;apos; But the Benjamites refused to yield to the demands of their brothers the Israelites. Yahweh answered, &amp;apos;Judah will go first.&amp;apos; Yahweh answered, &amp;apos;Attack! For tomorrow I will give you the victory!&amp;apos; But when the Benjamites had taken the bait , the Israelites said, &amp;apos;Retreat, and draw them away from the city to the main roads.&amp;apos; The fighting was fierce. And the Benjamites had no clue that disaster was at their doorstep. When the Benjamites had inflicted about thirty casualties on the men of Israel, they said, &amp;apos;Look, we are defeating them as we did in the first battle!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Instead, the Benjamites gathered warriors from all their towns to come to Gibeah and fight their brothers , the Israelites.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">On that day, the Benjamites gathered a force from their towns of twenty-six thousand armed men, not including the seven hundred elite soldiers of Gibeah.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Among Benjamin&amp;quot;s elite troops, seven hundred were left-handed, and each of them could sling a rock and hit a target within a hairbreadth without missing.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">The tribes of Israel had four hundred thousand experienced soldiers armed with swords, not counting Benjamin&amp;quot;s warriors.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Before the battle , the armies of Israel went to the house of God to seek counsel from God. The Israelites inquired, &amp;apos;Which tribe gets to go first to battle the Benjamites?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">The Israelites got up the next morning and encamped near Gibeah.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">The men of Israel took up battle positions against the Benjamites at Gibeah,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">but the Benjamites rushed out of the city, and slaughtered twenty-two thousand Israelites.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">The men of Israel encouraged one another and resumed their battle positions where they had lined up the first day.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">The Israelites wept before Yahweh until evening, and they inquired of Yahweh , &amp;apos;Should we go out again to battle with our brothers the Benjamites?&amp;apos; And Yahweh answered, &amp;apos;Yes, go back into the battle!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">The next day, the Israelites advanced toward the Benjamites.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">When Benjamin marched out from Gibeah to engage them, they struck down another eighteen thousand Israelite swordsmen.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">After losing again, the entire Israelite army went up to the house of God, and they sat there fasting and weeping before Yahweh all day until evening and presented burnt offerings and peace offerings before Yahweh .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">The Israelites inquired of Yahweh at Shiloh , for the ark of God&amp;quot;s covenant was there in those days.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">Phineas son of Eleazer, son of Aaron, ministered there before the ark . He inquired of Yahweh , saying, &amp;apos;Should we resume our battle with our brothers, the Benjamites? Or should we quit?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">So Israel set ambushes all around Gibeah.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">On the third day, one company of Israelites advanced against the Benjamites, deploying against Gibeah as they had before.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">This tactic drew the Benjamites out of the city to attack the advancing Israelite army, leaving the city unguarded. They began to inflict casualties on the Israelites as before. There they killed about thirty men of Israel.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">The Benjamites boasted, &amp;apos;We are defeating them just as we did before!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">Every Israelite rose from his position and took their assumed positions at Baal-Tamar. Then the Israelites who were hiding in ambush jumped up from their positions west of Gibeah.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">Ten thousand elite soldiers from all over Israel made their direct assault on Gibeah.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">On that day, Yahweh struck down the Benjamites before Israel. The Israelites slaughtered 25,100 swordsmen of Benjamin.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">Then the Benjamites realized that they were defeated. The Israelites had moved back because they were depending on the surprise attack they had set up near Gibeah.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">The men of Israel who had been waiting in ambush made a mad dash for Gibeah, attacked the city, and killed its inhabitants.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">The Israelites&amp;quot; strategy was to send up a smoke signal from the city once they had sacked it,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">and when the men of Israel saw the smoke signal, they would turn and rejoin the battle.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">But when the smoke signal began to go up from the city, the Benjamites looked behind them and saw the whole city going up in smoke!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">When the men of Israel turned back, the men of Benjamin saw that disaster had come upon them, and they panicked.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">So they fled toward the wilderness, retreating from the Israelites, but the Israelites overtook them and killed them there.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43">Surrounding the Benjamites, the Israelites chased them and easily overran them in the area east of Gibeah.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44">Eighteen thousand Benjamites died, all of them valiant fighters.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45">As they turned and fled in the wilderness to Rimmon Rock, the Israelites picked off another five thousand Benjamites on the main roads. They chased them as far as Gidom, killing two thousand more there.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46">That day, a total of twenty-five thousand sword-bearing Benjamites fell, all of them valiant fighters.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="47">But six hundred men who had fled to the wilderness camped at Rimmon Rock and remained there for four months.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="48">The men of Israel went back to the Benjamites and slaughtered every living thing in every town&amp;ndash;men and beasts and all that were found, and they burned down every town they came across.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="4">When the next day dawned, the people got up early, built an altar there, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Then the Israelites asked one another, &amp;apos;Which tribe of Israel failed to appear in our assembly before Yahweh ?&amp;apos; Under the terms of their solemn oath, whoever did not come before Yahweh at Mizpah should be put to death.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Even so, the Israelites had compassion for their brothers of the tribe of Benjamin and were grieved deeply over their loss . They lamented, &amp;apos;One of our tribes has been eliminated from Israel this day.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">How can we provide wives for the few survivors since we have sworn by Yahweh that we will not give any of our daughters as wives for them?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Then they inquired, &amp;apos;Were there any from the tribes of Israel who did not come up before Yahweh at Mizpah?&amp;apos; They found out that no one from Jabesh-Gilead had come to the assembly.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">When the roll was called among the people, not one of the inhabitants of Jabesh-Gilead was there.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">So the people sent twelve thousand soldiers with the command: &amp;apos;Go to the inhabitants of Jabesh-Gilead and kill them with the sword, including the women and children.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">This is what you are to do: exterminate every man and every woman who is not a virgin.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">And they found four hundred unmarried young virgins among those living in Jabesh-Gilead. They seized them and brought them to the camp at Shiloh in the land of Canaan.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Then the whole congregation sent word to the Benjamites at Rimmon Rock and offered them peace.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">The Benjamites returned, and the Israelites presented the young women they had spared at Jabesh-Gilead. But they were not a sufficient number of wives for them all.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">The people were remorseful and had compassion on the tribe of Benjamin because Yahweh had taken out a tribe of Israel.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">The elders of the tribes said, &amp;apos;Where are we to find wives for the survivors of Benjamin since there are no more women left in their tribe?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">And they said, &amp;apos;There must be heirs for the survivors of Benjamin to prevent the tribe from being wiped out from Israel.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Yet we cannot give them any of our daughters as wives.&amp;apos; For the Israelites had sworn, &amp;apos;A curse will rest on anyone who gives a wife to a Benjamite.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">So they said, &amp;apos;Look, Yahweh &amp;quot;s yearly festival is taking place at Shiloh, just north of Bethel, and east of the main road that goes up from Bethel to Shechem, and a little south of Lebonah.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">And they instructed the Benjamites, &amp;apos;Go and hide in the vineyards.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Watch for the young women of Shiloh to come out for their dances. When they come out of the vineyards, grab one of the young women of Shiloh to be your wife. Then go and live in your tribal land of Benjamin.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">If their fathers or their brothers come to complain to us, we&amp;quot;ll tell them, &amp;quot;Do us this favor, please. Grant us permission for the Benjamites to keep them as wives because in battle we didn&amp;quot;t seize them from you. And since you didn&amp;quot;t give them to us, you&amp;quot;re not guilty of breaking your oath.&amp;quot; &amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">So the Benjamites took as many wives as there were men from among the dancers, and they carried them away. Then they returned to their own territory and rebuilt towns to live in.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">The Israelites dispersed by tribes and families, and they went out from there to their own territories.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">In those days, Israel had no king, and everyone did whatever they wanted to do.</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="1">
			<VERS vnumber="3">Elimelech died and left his widow Naomi alone with her two sons.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">The two sons both married Moabite women, Orpah and Ruth. About ten years later,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Mahlon and Chilion also died and left Naomi all alone without husband or sons.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Sometime later, Naomi heard that Yahweh had visited his people and blessed them with an abundant harvest; so she decided to leave Moab with her daughters-in-law.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">With Orpah and Ruth at her side, Naomi began her journey to return to the land of Judah.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">But soon Naomi said to them, &amp;apos;Each of you, go back to your mother&amp;quot;s home. May Yahweh show his loyal love and kindness to you&amp;ndash;the same loyal love and kindness you&amp;quot;ve shown to me and to those who have died.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">And may Yahweh give you another husband and cause you to find rest in a happy home.&amp;apos; Then Naomi tenderly embraced Orpah and Ruth and kissed them goodbye, but they wailed and sobbed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Through their tears , they said to her, &amp;apos;No! We want to be with you and go with you to your people.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">&amp;apos;My daughters, you must go back,&amp;apos; Naomi answered. &amp;apos;Why do you want to come with me? Do you think I could have sons again to give you new husbands?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Turn around my daughters and go back home, for I&amp;quot;m too old to marry again. Even if I thought there was still hope for me, and married today and gave birth to sons,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">would you wait until they had grown up? Should you live for so many years without husbands? No, my daughters, you must not return with me . My life is too bitter for you to share it with me because Yahweh has brought calamity to my life!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">When they heard Naomi&amp;quot;s words, Orpah and Ruth wailed and sobbed again. Then Orpah embraced and kissed her mother-in-law goodbye and went back home , but Ruth clung tightly to Naomi and refused to let go of her.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Naomi said, &amp;apos;Ruth, listen. Your sister-in-law is going back to Moab to her people and to her gods. Now go with her.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">But tearfully , Ruth insisted, &amp;apos;Please don&amp;quot;t ask me again to leave you! I want to go with you and stay with you. Wherever you go, I will go; wherever you live, I will live. Your people will now be my people, and your God will now be my God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Wherever you die, I will die there, too; that&amp;quot;s where your people will bury me&amp;ndash; next to you . Nothing but death itself will separate me from you, so help me God!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">When Naomi realized that Ruth&amp;quot;s heart was set on going with her, she said nothing more.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Naomi and Ruth traveled together from Moab until they came to Bethlehem. The entire town was buzzing when they heard they had arrived! Astounded, the women of the town said to one another, &amp;apos;Is this really Naomi, who left us so long ago ?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">&amp;apos;Please don&amp;quot;t call me Naomi anymore,&amp;apos; she insisted. &amp;apos;Instead, call me Marah, because Almighty God has dealt me a bitter blow.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">When I left here, my heart was full and content with my family , but Yahweh has brought me back empty and destitute. Why call me by my name, &amp;quot;Pleasant,&amp;quot; when Yahweh has opposed me, and Almighty God has brought me so much trouble?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">So Naomi returned to her village with Ruth, her Moabite daughter-in-law. They arrived in Bethlehem just as the barley harvest had begun.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="2">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Naomi&amp;quot;s deceased husband, Elimelech, had a very wealthy relative, an honorable and prominent man in Bethlehem named Boaz.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">One day Ruth the Moabite said to Naomi, &amp;apos;Let me go to the fields and pick up the leftover grain. Maybe someone will be kind enough to let me gather the grain he leaves behind.&amp;apos; Naomi said to her, &amp;apos;Go, my daughter.&amp;apos; She told her mother-in-law about all that happened that day, and said, &amp;apos;The man in whose field I gathered grain today is Boaz.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">So Ruth went to the fields to gather the grain the reapers left behind. It just so happened that she found herself working at the edges of a field belonging to Boaz of the family of Elimelech.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">At that moment, Boaz came from Bethlehem to survey his harvest . He greeted the harvesters, &amp;apos;May Yahweh be with you.&amp;apos; They replied, &amp;apos;May Yahweh bless you.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Noticing Ruth , Boaz asked his foreman in charge of the harvesters, &amp;apos;Who is that young woman over there?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">The foreman answered, &amp;apos;She&amp;quot;s a Moabite girl who came back with Naomi from the country of Moab.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">She asked for permission to gather the grain left behind by the reapers. Except for one short break, she&amp;quot;s been on her feet working in the field since early this morning.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Boaz walked over to Ruth and said, &amp;apos;Listen, my daughter, don&amp;quot;t leave this field to glean somewhere else. Stay here in my field and follow the young women who work for me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Watch my harvesters to see into which fields they go to cut grain, and follow them. When you&amp;quot;re thirsty, go and drink from the water jugs that the young men have filled. I&amp;quot;ve warned the young men not to bother you.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Astounded , Ruth bowed low with her face to the ground, and said to him, &amp;apos;I&amp;quot;m a foreigner. Why have you been so kind and taken notice of me?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Boaz answered, &amp;apos;I&amp;quot;ve heard all about what you&amp;quot;ve done for your mother-in-law since the death of your husband. I know your story&amp;ndash;how you left your father and mother and your native land and came to a people and a culture that must seem strange to you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">May Yahweh reward you for your sacrifices, and because of what you&amp;quot;ve done, may you have a full and rich reward from Yahweh , the God of Israel, under whose wings you have come to find shelter!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Ruth replied, &amp;apos;May I continue to find favor in your sight, kind sir. You have spoken to my heart kind and reassuring words that comfort me, even though I am not as worthy as one of your servant girls.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">At mealtime, Boaz said to her, &amp;apos;Come here and eat with us. Here is bread, and wine to dip it in.&amp;apos; Ruth immediately sat down with the workers. Boaz handed her some roasted grain, and she ate all she wanted until she was satisfied&amp;ndash;she even had some left over.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">After she had returned to gather grain, Boaz instructed his young men, &amp;apos;Let her glean even among the standing sheaves, and don&amp;quot;t disgrace her.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Pull out from the bundles some handfuls of grain and drop them on purpose for her to gather, and don&amp;quot;t bother her.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">So Ruth gathered grain in Boaz&amp;quot;s field until evening. When she threshed out what she had gathered, it came to more than half a bushel of barley.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">She carried it back to town and showed her mother-in-law how much she had gleaned. Then Ruth also took out the roasted grain she had saved from mealtime and shared it with Naomi.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Her mother-in-law asked Ruth, &amp;apos;Where did you gather all this from ? In whose field did you work? May Yahweh bless the man who showed you special attention.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Naomi said to Ruth, &amp;apos; Yahweh &amp;quot;s loving-kindness has not left us either through life or through death! Boaz is closely related to us. He is a kinsman-redeemer of our family. May Yahweh greatly bless Boaz !&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Ruth the Moabite responded, &amp;apos;He even said to me, &amp;quot;Stay close by my servants until they have finished all my harvest.&amp;quot; &amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Naomi replied, &amp;apos;It is best, my daughter, that you stay near his young women, otherwise you&amp;quot;ll be alone and might be bothered in someone else&amp;quot;s field.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">So Ruth worked alongside the young women who served Boaz. She lived with her mother-in-law and gleaned in Boaz&amp;quot;s fields until the end of the barley and wheat harvests.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="3">
			<VERS vnumber="1">One day, Naomi said to Ruth: &amp;apos;I want to see you marry so that you&amp;quot;ll be happy and secure.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Now listen, a man named Boaz is our relative. You worked with his servant girls in his fields. This evening, he&amp;quot;ll be winnowing barley on the threshing floor.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Now, take a bath and put on some nice perfume. Dress in your best clothes and go to the threshing floor, but don&amp;quot;t let him know you&amp;quot;re there until he&amp;quot;s had plenty to eat and drink.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Watch closely to see where he lies down. Then go, uncover his feet, and lie down there. He will tell you what to do.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Ruth answered, &amp;apos;I&amp;quot;ll do everything you&amp;quot;ve told me.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">That evening, Ruth went down to the threshing floor and did all her mother-in-law had told her to do.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">After his evening meal, Boaz was in a good mood. He went to lie down at the far end of the grain pile and fell fast asleep. Ruth quietly tiptoed over to him, uncovered his feet, and lay down.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Around midnight, Boaz was startled, and he awoke. He was surprised to find a woman lying at his feet.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">&amp;apos;Who are you?&amp;apos; Boaz asked. &amp;apos;I am Ruth, your servant girl,&amp;apos; she answered. &amp;apos;Spread the corner of your garment over me because you are a close relative by marriage, one who is my kinsman-redeemer.&amp;apos; As she held it open, Boaz poured six measures of barley into it. He then helped place it on her head to carry, and she went back to Bethlehem.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Boaz said: &amp;apos;Dear woman, may Yahweh bless you, for this act of kindness you are showing me exceeds the kindness you have shown to Naomi . You didn&amp;quot;t search for a young man to marry, either rich or poor.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">My daughter, don&amp;quot;t worry. I promise to do everything you ask, because everyone knows you&amp;quot;re a brave woman of noble character.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">It&amp;quot;s true that I am a kinsman-redeemer, but you have a closer kinsman-redeemer than I.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Stay here tonight, and I will protect you . In the morning, we&amp;quot;ll see if he&amp;quot;s willing to redeem you. If he does, good; let him. But if he refuses to redeem you, then I promise, as surely as Yahweh lives, I will. Sleep here until morning.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">So Ruth stayed near Boaz&amp;quot;s feet that night. She awoke before it was light enough for anyone to recognize her. Boaz thought, &amp;apos;No one must know that a woman visited me at the threshing floor.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">As Ruth was about to leave , Boaz said to her, &amp;apos;Here, bring me the cloak you&amp;quot;re wearing and hold it open.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">When Ruth returned to her mother-in-law, Naomi asked her, &amp;apos;How did it go, my dear daughter? How did Boaz receive you? &amp;apos; Ruth told Naomi everything that he did for her.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">She added, &amp;apos;Boaz gave me all this barley, saying, &amp;quot;You must not go home empty-handed without a gift for your mother in law.&amp;quot; &amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Naomi answered, &amp;apos;My daughter, wait here until you see what happens. Boaz will not rest until he has finished doing what he promised he would do today.&amp;apos;</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="4">
			<VERS vnumber="1">No sooner had Boaz gone up to the city gate and sat down when the kinsman-redeemer of whom Boaz had spoken came passing by. Boaz called to him, &amp;apos;Come over here, friend; sit down with me. We have some business to attend to .&amp;apos; So the man went over and sat down.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Then Boaz invited ten men of the city council and said, &amp;apos; Please , sit down here with us.&amp;apos; After they were seated,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Boaz turned to the kinsman-redeemer and said, &amp;apos; Sir , Naomi has returned from the country of Moab, and she&amp;quot;s selling the piece of property that belonged to our relative Elimelech.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">So I thought you ought to know about it. Buy it if you want. We can make it official in the presence of those here and in the presence of the elders of our people. As the kinsman-redeemer, you have the first right of refusal. Redeem it if you choose to, but if not, tell me so I will know, as I am next in line .&amp;apos; The man replied, &amp;apos;I&amp;quot;ll redeem it.&amp;apos; Perez became the father of Hezron, Ram the father of Amminadab, Nahshon the father of Salmon, Boaz the father of Obed,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Then Boaz added, &amp;apos;The day you buy the field from the hand of Naomi, you also acquire Ruth the Moabite, the widow of the dead. Therefore, it will be your responsibility to father a child in order to maintain the dead man&amp;quot;s name on his inheritance.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">At this, the kinsman-redeemer balked and said, &amp;apos;In that case, I&amp;quot;m not able to redeem it for myself without risking my own inheritance. Take my purchase option of redemption yourself, for I can&amp;quot;t do it.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">(At that time in Israel, in order to finalize a transaction concerning redeeming and transferring property, a man would customarily remove a sandal and give it to the other party, making the contract legally binding.)</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">So when the kinsman-redeemer said to Boaz, &amp;apos;Take my purchase option of redemption for yourself,&amp;apos; he took off his sandal and gave it to Boaz .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Then Boaz turned to the elders and announced publicly, &amp;apos;Today, you are witnesses that I have purchased from the hand of Naomi all that belonged to Elimelech and all that belonged to Chilion and Mahlon.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">I have also acquired Ruth the Moabite, Mahlon&amp;quot;s widow, to be my wife. I will raise children with her who will maintain the dead man&amp;quot;s name on his inheritance so that the name of the dead may not be cut off from his village and from his family line. Today, you are witnesses of this transaction.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Then all the elders and all the people who were at the gate said: &amp;apos;We are witnesses. May Yahweh make the woman who is coming into your house like Rachel and Leah, both of whom built up the house of Israel. May you become famous in Bethlehem! May you become very prosperous!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">And may Yahweh give you children by this young woman, and through them, may your family be like the family of Perez, whom Tamar bore to Judah!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">So Boaz and Ruth married, and they became one as husband and wife. Yahweh opened Ruth&amp;quot;s womb, and she bore a son.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Then the women of Bethlehem blessed Naomi: &amp;apos;Praise Yahweh , who never abandoned you nor withheld from you a kinsman-redeemer! And may his name be famous in Israel!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">May this child renew your life and sustain you in your old age! May your daughter-in-law, who loves you dearly, be more to you than seven sons could ever be, for she has given you a wonderful grandchild!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Then Naomi took her grandson and cuddled him in her arms and cared for him as if he were her own.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">The women of the neighborhood gave him a name, saying, &amp;apos;At last, Naomi has a son!&amp;apos; They named him Obed, and he became the father of Jesse, the father of David.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Now these are the descendants of Perez:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Hezron the father of Ram,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Amminadab the father of Nahshon,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Salmon the father of Boaz,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Obed the father of Jesse, who had a famous son, King David.</VERS>

We will continue to tell our children and not hide from the rising generation the great marvels of our God&amp;ndash; his miracles and power that have brought us all this far. He established decrees for Jacob and established the law in Israel, and he commanded our forefathers to teach them to their children. from one generation to the next, even to those not yet born. and not forget his wonderful works but keep his commandments. of their fickle fathers, who were a stubborn, rebellious generation and whose spirits strayed from the eternal God. They refused to love him with all their hearts. Though they were all equipped warriors, each with weapons, when the battle began they retreated and ran away in fear. they refused to trust him and move forward in faith. the waters stood at attention on either side as the people passed on through! And all through the night the fire-cloud stood as a sentry of light. and the waters flowed like a river before their very eyes. He gave them all they wanted to drink from his living springs. and their sins against God continued to be counted. asking for the food their hearts craved. demanding he prove his love by saying, &amp;apos;Can&amp;quot;t God provide for us in this barren wilderness? Will he give us food, or will he only give us water? Where&amp;quot;s our meal?&amp;apos; His anger flared up against his people. the windows of heaven poured out food, the mercy bread-manna. The grain of grace fell from the clouds. His grace gave them more than enough! and food rained down upon them; succulent quail quieted their hunger as they ate all they wanted. their provision floated down right in front of their eyes! even with their food still in their mouths, God&amp;quot;s fiery anger arose against them, killing the finest of their mighty men. Even when they saw God&amp;quot;s marvels, they refused to believe God could care for them. with nothing to show for their lives but fear and failure. but when he began to kill them, ending their lives in a moment, they came running back to God, pleading for mercy. was their strong protector, the Hero-God who would come to their rescue. they lied through their teeth to the true God of the Covenant. So quickly they wandered away from his promises, following God with their words and not their hearts! Their worship was only flattery. He covered over their sins with his love, refusing to destroy them all. Over and over he held back his anger, restraining wrath to show them mercy. frail, fragile, and short-lived, here today and gone tomorrow. How they grieved him with their grumblings. Continually they turned back from him and with redemption&amp;quot;s kiss he delivered them from their enemies. when they escaped from Egypt&amp;quot;s bondage. They forgot the judgment of the plagues that set them free. He sent hordes of frogs, ruining their lives. was flattened with blasts of hailstones, their fruit trees ruined by a killing frost. their livestock were struck with bolts of lightning. Such fury! He sent them sorrow and devastating trouble by his mighty band of destroying angels; messengers of death were dispatched against them. and did not spare their lives. He released the judgment-plagues to rage through their land. God struck down in death all the firstborn sons of Egypt&amp;ndash; the pride and joy of each family. out of tyranny, guiding them through the wilderness like a flock. But their enemies he led into the sea. He took care of them there once and for all! staking out an inheritance, a portion for each of Israel&amp;quot;s tribes. provoking to anger the God Most High. They were even worse than their fathers! They became treacherous deceivers, crooked and corrupt, and worshiped false gods in the high places, bringing low the name of God with every idol they erected. No wonder he was filled with jealousy and furious with anger! and he rejected his people with disgust. abandoning the place where he had lived among them, Enemies stole the very source of Israel&amp;quot;s power. when they went out to battle, for his anger was intense against his very own. Their daughters never heard their wedding songs, since there was no one left to marry! before they had time to weep. as though he had been asleep. Like a mighty man he arose, roaring into action! defeating them and disgracing them for time and eternity. and Mount Zion, which he loves. strong and enduring as the earth itself. He promoted him from caring for sheep and made him his prophetic servant. and presented him before the people as the one who would love and care for them with integrity, a pure heart, and the anointing to lead Israel, his holy inheritance.</VERS>

You give us daily bread to sustain life, Lebanon&amp;quot;s lofty trees stand tall right where you planted them. a place to build their nests; even herons find a home in the cypress trees. and the rocky crag where the rock badgers burrow. and the sun to measure the days. and all the beasts of the forest come out to prowl. but it&amp;quot;s you, God, who feeds them all. to crouch down in the shadows. working from dawn to dusk. Wild and wonderful is this world you have made, while wisdom was there at your side. This world is full of so many creatures, yet each belongs to you! swarming with countless forms of sea life, both small and great. And look! There are the massive whales bounding upon the waves. to give them their food as you determine. feasting from your open hands, and each is satisfied from your abundant supply. they all would panic. And when you choose to take away their breath, each one dies and returns to the dust. ready to replenish life upon the earth. May the Lord take joy and pleasure in all that he has made. just a touch of his finger and volcanoes erupt as the earth shakes and melts. Every day I will sing my praises to God. for you are the source of my joy and gladness. But I will keep on praising you, my Lord, with all that is within me. My joyous, blissful shouts of &amp;apos;Hallelujah&amp;apos; are all because of you! overwhelming me by your majesty, beauty, and splendor! men and beasts have their thirst quenched because of you.

Make a joke of my advice, will you? Then I&amp;quot;ll make a joke out of you! when dread and distress consume you and your catastrophe comes like a hurricane, Then it will be too late to expect my help. When desperation drives you to search for me, I will be nowhere to be found. and closed your eyes to the facts and laughed at my correction&amp;ndash; You&amp;quot;ve made your own bed; now lie in it!

			<VERS vnumber="1">During the reign of Ahaz, the son of Jotham and grandson of Uzziah, two kings launched an attack against Jerusalem: Rezin, the king of Syria, and Pekah, the son of Remaliah, the king of Israel. But they failed to conquer it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">When the royal court was told that Syria had formed an alliance with the northern kingdom of Israel, the heart of King Ahaz and all his people trembled with fear, like trees swaying in the wind.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Then Yahweh spoke to Isaiah and said, &amp;apos;Go and meet with King Ahaz. You&amp;quot;ll find him on the road to the Washerman&amp;quot;s Field at the end of the aqueduct where it empties into the upper pool. Take with you your son, whom you named a Remnant Will Return.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Give him this message: &amp;quot;Stay calm! Be quiet and guard your heart! Don&amp;quot;t panic or be discouraged over these two smoldering stubs of firewood, because of the rage of Rezin and Aram, the son of Remaliah.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Syria has plotted with the northern kingdom of Israel and the son of Remaliah to come against you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">They are saying, &amp;apos;We will attack Judah and cut off Jerusalem&amp;ndash;we will terrorize and conquer it for ourselves and install the son of Tabeel as king!&amp;apos; &amp;quot; &amp;apos;</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="12">Ahaz answered, &amp;apos;I will not ask. I won&amp;quot;t attempt to test the Lord Yahweh .&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">So Isaiah said, &amp;apos;Pay attention, family of David. It&amp;quot;s bad enough to try the patience of a prophet but even worse when you try the patience of my God as well!</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="22">they will give so much milk that he will have more than he needs. And everyone left in the land will have all the milk and honey they desire .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">In that day, the fine vineyards, each with a thousand vines and worth a thousand pieces of silver, will be a wilderness overgrown with weeds, briars, and thorn bushes.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">People will hunt there with bow and arrow but will find nothing except thorn bushes and briars!</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="36">
			<VERS vnumber="1">In the fourteenth year of King Hezekiah&amp;quot;s reign, Sennacherib, king of Assyria, attacked all the fortified cities of Judah and conquered them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">After defeating Lachish , Sennacherib sent his chief commander with his massive army from there to King Hezekiah in Jerusalem. He took up a position on the road to the Washerman&amp;quot;s Field, at the end of the aqueduct where it empties into the upper pool.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">And coming out to meet him were three officials of the king : Eliakim, son of Hilkiah, the palace administrator; Shebna, the scribe; and Joah, son of Asaph, the secretary.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Sennacherib&amp;quot;s commander said to them, &amp;apos;Tell Hezekiah, this is what the exalted king, the king of Assyria, says: &amp;quot;What makes you so confident?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">You think you have a strategy and defensive might, but mere words are no match for my army ! In whom are you trusting for help that you rebel against me?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">I know&amp;ndash;you are relying on Egypt, that broken staff full of splinters. If anyone leans on it, it will pierce his hand. Pharaoh himself, king of Egypt, is like that splintered staff to those who put their trust in him! But you tell me that you are trusting in Yahweh , your God. For Hezekiah went around destroying every sacred altar from the land. Didn&amp;quot;t he insist that Judah and Jerusalem had to worship only at this altar in your temple ?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Now it&amp;quot;s time to make a deal with my master, the king of Assyria. I will give you two thousand horses if you&amp;quot;re able to come up with as many men to ride them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">You&amp;quot;re no match against even one officer of the least of my master&amp;quot;s officials! Why put your confidence in Egypt&amp;quot;s chariots and horsemen?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">What&amp;quot;s more, do you really think I&amp;quot;ve marched against this land to destroy it on my own without Yahweh &amp;quot;s approval?&amp;quot; &amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Then Eliakim, Shebna, and Joah replied, &amp;apos;Please speak to us, your servants, in Aramaic, for we understand it. Don&amp;quot;t speak to us in Hebrew, for the people on the wall are listening to us, and they will overhear our conversation.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">But the commander answered them, &amp;apos;Do you think I came to deliver this message from my master only to you and your king? It is also meant for the men sitting there on the wall to hear! They are the ones who will eat their own excrement and drink their own urine!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">So the commander stood and shouted out in a loud voice in Hebrew to the men listening on the wall , &amp;apos;Hear the words of the great King Sennacherib , the king of Assyria,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">for he has sent me with these words: &amp;quot;Don&amp;quot;t let Hezekiah mislead you, for there is nothing he can do to save you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Don&amp;quot;t be deceived when he tries to persuade you to trust in Yahweh , saying to you, &amp;apos; Yahweh will come to our rescue and our city will not be handed over to the king of Assyria.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Don&amp;quot;t listen to Hezekiah, for the king of Assyria says to you, &amp;apos;Make your peace with me and surrender so that you may continue to eat from your own grapes and figs and drink the water from your own cisterns</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">until I come and take you away to a land like your own. It is a good land of grain and wine, bread and vineyards.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Don&amp;quot;t be deceived by Hezekiah&amp;quot;s empty words when he says to you, &amp;apos; Yahweh will save us.&amp;apos; Has any god ever saved a nation from the mighty hand of the king of Assyria?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Where were the gods of Hamath and Arphad? Where were the gods of Sepharvaim? Did any god save your northern kingdom of Samaria from me?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Where is there a god that could save its people from my mighty hand?&amp;quot; &amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">But they were silent, and no one answered him a word, for King Hezekiah had ordered them, &amp;apos;Do not answer him.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">So the three officials of Hezekiah&amp;ndash;Eliakim, son of Hilkiah, the palace administrator; Shebna, the scribe; and Joah, son of Asaph the secretary&amp;ndash;came to Hezekiah with their clothes torn as a sign of despair and reported what the Assyrian commander had said.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="37">
			<VERS vnumber="1">When Hezekiah heard what the commander had said, he tore his robe, put on sackcloth, and went to the temple of Yahweh .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">And he sent Eliakim, the palace administrator; Shebna, the royal scribe; and the leading priests&amp;ndash;all clothed in sackcloth&amp;ndash;to the prophet Isaiah, son of Amoz.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">They told him, &amp;apos;Here is Hezekiah&amp;quot;s message: &amp;quot;This is a day of great anguish, rebuke, and humiliation. We are desperate , as in the day a woman is in heavy labor but has no strength left to give birth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Perhaps Lord Yahweh , your God, will take note of all the blasphemous words of the Assyrian commander who was sent by his master, the king of Assyria, to ridicule the living God. And may Lord Yahweh , your God, rebuke him for the words he heard him speak. So therefore, we come to ask you to pray for us, the remnant that still survives.&amp;quot; &amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">I will put in him a mindset that will cause him, when he hears a certain rumor, to flee back to his own country. And when he returns I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land.&amp;apos; &amp;quot; &amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Meanwhile, the Assyrian commander returned to the king, for he had heard that the king had left Lachish to lay siege against the city of Libnah.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Now, King Sennacherib had heard a report that the king of Ethiopia, Tirhakah, had allied with Hezekiah and was coming to fight against him. So when he heard it he sent messengers to Hezekiah with this message:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">&amp;apos;Don&amp;quot;t let this God in whom you trust mislead you into thinking that Jerusalem will not fall and be delivered into the hand of the mighty king of Assyria.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Certainly you have heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all the lands, destroying them all. Do you really think you&amp;quot;ll be delivered?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Did any of their gods come to their rescue? Where were the gods of Gozan, Haran, Rezeph, and the people of Eden, who were in Tel Azzar when my predecessors destroyed their lands?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Tell me , where is the king of Hamath, the king of Arphad, the king of the city of Sepharvaim, or of Hena or Ivva?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">When the messengers delivered Sennacherib&amp;quot;s message to Hezekiah, he read it and immediately went into the temple of Yahweh and spread it out before the Lord.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">And he prayed:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">&amp;apos;O Yahweh , Commander of Angel Armies, the God of Israel, you are enthroned between the wings of the cherubim and you reign supreme as God over all the kingdoms of the world, for you alone are Creator of heaven and earth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Please lean down to hear my prayer. Yahweh , open your eyes and see me here calling out to you. Listen carefully to every blasphemous word Sennacherib has sent to ridicule and insult you, the living God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">&amp;apos;Lord Yahweh , truly the Assyrian kings have annihilated all these nations and conquered their lands.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">They smashed and burned their gods, for they&amp;quot;re not truly gods but mere idols made by human hands shaped from wood and stone. That&amp;quot;s why they could be destroyed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">So now, our loving God, Yahweh , save us from the Assyrians so that the whole world will know that you alone are Yahweh , Lord God Almighty.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Then Isaiah, son of Amoz, sent this message to Hezekiah: &amp;apos;Hear the words of Yahweh , the God of Israel: &amp;quot;Because you prayed to me about the taunts of Sennacherib, king of Assyria, &amp;apos; &amp;quot;The virgin daughter of Zion despises you and ridicules you. My daughter, Jerusalem, tosses her head back and makes fun of you! Against whom do you raise your voice? And whom have you looked down upon in your arrogance? None other than me, the Holy One of Israel! You boast, &amp;apos;My vast number of chariots has taken me up the highest mountains, to the heights of Lebanon&amp;quot;s forests. I cut down its loftiest cedars, its choicest cypresses. I ascended its highest peak and claimed its great forests. The feet of my armies trampled the Nile delta dry.&amp;apos; Yes, from ages past I planned it, and now I fulfill it, that you would conquer fortified cities and turn them into piles of stones. They became as fragile as weeds and tender grass, as short-lived as the grass that grows on the rooftop all that you do, and your rage against me. and because you rage against me, I will put my hook in your nose and my bit in your mouth, and I will make you return by the way you came.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">this is what I, Yahweh , decree concerning him:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">Whom do you think you&amp;quot;re mocking and blaspheming?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">You sent your messengers to mock the Lord.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">I dug wells and drank foreign water.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">&amp;apos; &amp;quot;Have you not learned that I planned all this long ago?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">The inhabitants were frightened and ashamed. and is scorched before the east wind.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">I know where you live, every movement you make,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">I have heard your arrogant words,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">&amp;apos; &amp;quot;Hezekiah, this will be a sign for you: This year you will eat only grain that grows of itself. Next year you will eat what comes of that. Then, in the third year, life will be normal again . You will sow and reap, plant vineyards and eat their fruit.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">Judah&amp;quot;s remnant will flourish again, sending deep roots into the ground and bearing luscious fruit above,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">for a remnant will go out from Mount Zion and Jerusalem. The fiery passion of Yahweh , Commander of Angel Armies, will accomplish this!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">&amp;apos; &amp;quot;Therefore, here is what I, Yahweh , have to say about the king of Assyria: He will neither enter this city, nor shoot even one arrow here, nor raise a warrior&amp;quot;s shield, nor build a siege ramp against Jerusalem.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">I declare that by the way he came, by that same way he will leave. He will not set foot in the city.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">I promise to defend this city and protect it, for the sake of my own honor and for the sake of David, my loving servant.&amp;quot; &amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">That night the angel of Yahweh came into the Assyrian camp and slaughtered 185,000 soldiers. When morning dawned, there were only dead bodies in the enemy&amp;quot;s camp!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">Sennacherib, the great king of Assyria, left, returning the same way he came , and retreated to Nineveh, the Assyrian capital .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">Then one day , as he was worshiping in the temple of his god, Nisroch, his sons, Adrammelech and Sharezer, entered the temple and killed him with swords. They escaped into the land of Ararat and the king&amp;quot;s son Esar-haddon succeeded him.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="38">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Now, Hezekiah became sick and was at the point of death. The prophet Isaiah, son of Amoz, came and prophesied to him, saying, &amp;apos;This is what Yahweh has to say to you: Set your affairs in order, for you will not recover from this illness. You are going to die.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Then Hezekiah broke down and wept , turned his face to the wall, and prayed, &amp;apos;O please, Yahweh , please. I beg you, let me live .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Remember how I have walked faithfully before your face. With all my heart, I have sought to do only what is good in your eyes.&amp;apos; Bitter tears streamed down his face.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Then Isaiah received another prophetic word for Hezekiah. Yahweh said to him,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">&amp;apos;Go deliver this message to Hezekiah: &amp;quot;This is what Yahweh , the God of your ancestor David, has to say to you: I have heard your heartfelt prayer and I have seen you cry tear after bitter tear. I will give you another fifteen years.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">I will defend Jerusalem, and I will deliver you and this city from the hand of the king of Assyria.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">This will be a sign to you from Yahweh as a confirmation that I will do for you what I have promised.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">I will cause the sun&amp;quot;s shadow to retreat ten steps on the stairway of Ahaz.&amp;quot; &amp;apos; Then the sunlight went back up the ten steps it had gone down.

It is in you that my spirit lives.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Here is the poem of Hezekiah, king of Judah, which he wrote when he was healed from his illness:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">I was dying in the prime of life. I thought, &amp;apos;Must I leave this world now? Must I go through the gates of death and miss out on the rest of my years?&amp;apos; in the land of the living. No longer will I see my friends or family nor enjoy the company of anyone living on earth. taken down like a shepherd&amp;quot;s tent. He cuts my life short, as a weaver cuts his cloth from the loom and rolls it up. From day to night, you bring my life to an end. as I cried out for help until morning. From day to night, you bring my life to an end. I could only moan like a dove. My eyes are weary from looking up into heaven. For he has spoken to me and told me Now restore my health and give me life again ! that I had this bitter experience. For you loved my soul out of the pit of oblivion. You cast all my sins behind your back. Neither the realm of death nor those who enter it can give you thanks or hope for your faithfulness. One generation makes your faithfulness known to the next. We will sing to the music of stringed instruments every day of our lives in Yahweh &amp;quot;s house.&amp;apos;</VERS>

He let them see all of his gold, silver, spices, and costly fragrant oils, as well as his entire armory. All of the king&amp;quot;s royal treasures, all that was in the king&amp;quot;s palace, and all the wealth of his whole kingdom was shown to them.</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="1">
			<VERS vnumber="4">As I looked into the spirit realm , I saw a fierce whirlwind and a massive cloud coming toward me from the north. Within the approaching cloud I saw raging flames of fire&amp;ndash;flames enfolding themselves in flames! And outlining the glory cloud was a radiant light. And in the center of the flashing fire, I saw a substance of blinding brilliance with the appearance of electrum.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">And I also saw standing in the middle of the storm what seemed to be four creatures, each with the appearance of a man. They looked like this:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Each had four faces, and each had four wings.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Their legs were straight, but they had hooves like calves. Their hooves were bright and glistening like polished brass.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">All four of them had faces and wings, and each of the supernatural beings had a pair of human hands under its wings. There were hands on all four sides of the living creatures.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">They joined one another with their wings, forming a square . When they moved forward in whatever direction, they went together as a group, without turning their bodies.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">And all four beings had four faces: a human face in front , a lion&amp;quot;s face to the right, an ox&amp;quot;s face to the left, and an eagle&amp;quot;s face in the back .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Their wings were divided into two pairs; one pair was extended upward so that each one touched the wingtips of the one next to it, and the other pair covered its body.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">And each one moved straight forward, moving where the Spirit directed them, and they did not turn as they moved.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">These living creatures looked like burning coals of fire, like blazing torches. Flames flashed back and forth between the creatures. The light was blinding, and lightning was flashing out of it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">And the living creatures kept disappearing and reappearing like shooting stars.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">As I observed the four-faced creatures, I saw four shining wheels standing on the ground beside each of them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">All four wheels looked entirely alike, glittering like sparkling jewels. Each appeared to have another wheel inside it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">And the wheels were able to go in any direction the living creatures faced without turning to change direction.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">The circumference of the rims seemed enormous, breathtaking in size, and all four rims were full of eyes all the way around.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Regardless of the direction the living creatures moved, the wheels moved with them, and when the living creatures levitated off the ground, the wheels levitated also.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">And the spirit in the living creatures was also in the wheels, and wherever the spirit went, the creatures went. Wherever the spirit wanted to go, the creatures went there, and the wheels also rose and went with them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">So every time the creatures moved, or halted, or levitated, the wheels did also because the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Suspended above the living creatures I saw something that looked like a platform spread out above them. The platform was fearsome, transparent , and shining like sparkling glass.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">And under the platform were the four living creatures with wings outstretched and touching one another and each with a pair of wings covering its body.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">When they moved, I heard the awesome sound of their wings. It was like the noise of roaring rapids, like the voice of Shaddai, and like the sound of an army advancing! And when the creatures stopped moving, they lowered their wings.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">Then, as they stood still, I heard someone speaking from above the platform over their heads.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">High on the platform over their heads, I saw something that looked like a beautiful throne made of sapphire. And high above on the throne was one who had the form of a man.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">I saw what appeared to be his waist upward, and it was bright and dazzling metal; and from what appeared to be his waist downward, I saw what looked like flames of fire, giving off a brilliant light all around.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">The radiance of the light encircling the throne had in it every color of the rainbow like on the day of a downpour. This was the appearance of the glory of Yahweh ! And when I saw this, I fell on my face. Then, I heard the voice of someone speaking to me.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="2">
			<VERS vnumber="1">He said to me, &amp;apos;Son of man, rise to your feet; I want to talk to you.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">The moment I heard these words, the Spirit flowed into me and set me upright on my feet.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">And I heard him speaking to me, saying, &amp;apos;Son of man, I am sending you to the rebellious sons of Israel who have refused allegiance to me. They and their ancestors have been in revolt against me up to the present day.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">I am sending you to a stubborn and hard-hearted people. Tell them, &amp;quot;Lord Yahweh says this.&amp;quot;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">And whether they listen or not, this tribe of defiant rebels will know that a true prophet is among them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">And you, son of man, do not be afraid of them or of anything they say, even though you may feel like you are stepping on thorns and sitting on scorpions. Do not be afraid of their angry words or intimidated by their glaring stares, for they are rebellion personified!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">You are to speak my words to them whether they listen to you or rebelliously refuse.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">But you, son of man, listen to what I am saying to you: do not be like them, for they are a tribe of rebels. Now, open your mouth and eat what I am about to give you.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Just then, I saw a hand holding a scroll reaching out to me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">He unrolled it in front of me with writing on both sides. On it was written &amp;apos;Lament, Mourning, and Cries of Doom.&amp;apos;</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="3">
			<VERS vnumber="1">He said to me, &amp;apos;Son of man, eat what you see in front of you; eat this scroll, then go and speak to the people of Israel.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">So I opened my mouth, and he fed me the scroll,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">saying, &amp;apos;Son of man, eat this scroll I am giving to you and fill your belly with it.&amp;apos; So I began to chew it, and it tasted as sweet as honey.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Then he said, &amp;apos;Son of man, now go to the people of Israel and speak my words to them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">I am not sending you to a nation that speaks a difficult foreign language but to the people of Israel&amp;ndash;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">not to nations whose complex languages you could not understand and who speak words you cannot even pronounce. Surely, if I sent you to them, they would listen to you,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">but the people of Israel will refuse to listen to you because they refuse to listen to me. The whole family of Israel has a hard heart and is stubbornly defiant.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">But now, I will make you as stubborn and defiant as they are!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">I will make your resolve as hard as the hardest stone, even harder than flint. So do not fear them or be afraid because of their angry stares, for they are a tribe of rebels.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Then he said, &amp;apos;Son of man, listen carefully and take to heart everything I say to you,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">then go to the Jews in exile and say to them, &amp;quot;Listen to what Lord Yahweh says,&amp;quot; whether they listen or not.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Then the Spirit lifted me up, and behind me I heard a loud, thunderous voice: &amp;apos;Blessed be the glory of Yahweh in his sanctuary!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">I heard the sound of the living creatures as their wings kissed each other and the sound of the rumbling wheels beside them, like the sound of a great earthquake.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">The Spirit lifted me up and took me away. I went in the heat of my spirit, and the hand of Yahweh rested powerfully upon me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">The Spirit took me to Tel Abib, the very place where the Jewish exiles were living beside the River Chebar. I remained there with them for a week, dumbfounded and overwhelmed by what I had seen and heard .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Afterward, Yahweh spoke the following words to me:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">&amp;apos;Son of man, I am appointing you as a watchman for the people of Israel. When you hear me speak to you, give them my warning.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">If I say to wicked people, &amp;quot;You are headed toward certain death,&amp;quot; and you fail to give them warning by not speaking up to warn the evil ones against their evil courses so as to keep them alive, then the wicked ones will die for their sinful deeds. But I will hold you responsible for their deaths.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">But if you do warn the wicked and they keep sinning anyway, they&amp;quot;ll most certainly die for their sin, but you won&amp;quot;t die. You&amp;quot;ll have saved your life.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">And if righteous people turn away from righteous living and pursue a life of sin, I will set calamities before them, and they will die. Because you did not give them warning, they will die for their sinful deeds, and all the righteous deeds done earlier in life will not be remembered. But I will hold you responsible for their deaths.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">If, however, you do warn a righteous person not to sin and he responds to your warning, that person will live, and you will have also saved your life.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">While I was there, Yahweh seized me with his power, and he said to me, &amp;apos;Stand up, go out into the valley, and I will speak with you there.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">So I got up and went down into the valley and behold, the awesome glory of Yahweh manifested in front of me ! It was like the vision of glory I had seen by the River Chebar, and I fell facedown.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1">Yahweh said , &amp;apos;Son of man, take a clay tile and lay it in front of you. Sketch the city of Jerusalem on the tile.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Build a wall around it and, to represent a siege, pile up a dirt ramp against the wall. Then prepare to attack it as if it were a real city . Surround it with armed soldiers and station battering rams on all sides.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Then take an iron frying pan and place it on edge as though it were an iron wall between you and the city. Then direct your gaze toward the city, for it is under siege and you are besieging it. This is to be a sign, an object lesson for the people of Israel.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">After that, lie down a second time but turn over on your right side and stay like that for forty days, one day for each year of the guilt of the people of Judah.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Then direct your gaze on the model of the siege of Jerusalem, shake your fist at the city and prophesy against her.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Behold, I am going to tie you up, and you will not be able to turn from one side to the other until the period of your seclusion is over.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">&amp;apos;Now take some wheat, barley, beans, lentils, and other grains; store them all together and make bread for yourself. This will be your food for the 390 days you are lying on your side.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="11">And you are to ration the water you drink to two cups at a set time each day.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Eat the food as you would a barley cake. While everyone can see you, build a fire with dried human excrement, then bake the bread on the coals.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">And Yahweh said, &amp;apos;In this same way the Israelites will have to eat defiled food among the nations where I will disperse them.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Then I replied, &amp;apos;Oh no! Lord Yahweh , I have never defiled myself, from childhood until now. I have never eaten meat from any animal that died a natural death or was killed by wild animals. Nothing unclean has ever entered my mouth.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">&amp;apos;Very well,&amp;apos; he said, &amp;apos;I will let you use dried cow manure instead of human excrement as fuel to bake your bread.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Then he added, &amp;apos;Son of man, I am going to cut off Jerusalem&amp;quot;s food supply. In their horrible distress, the food they eat and the water they drink will be rationed.</VERS>

Take another third and chop it up with the sword around the perimeter of the tile-city. Then scatter the last third to the wind. I will pursue those who escape the city with my sword.</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="8">
			<VERS vnumber="1">In the sixth year of our exile , on the fifth day of the sixth month, the elders of Judah and I were sitting in my home. Suddenly, I felt the mighty power of the Lord Yahweh come over me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Behold, I saw a fiery human figure. His body looked like fire! Below the waist were flames of fire; above the waist he glistened as bright as glowing bronze.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">He reached out with what seemed like a hand and grabbed me by my hair. Then, in a great and wonderful vision from God, the Spirit lifted me up high in the air and transported me to Jerusalem. He took me to the entrance of the north gate of the inner court where the disgusting idol that provokes Yahweh &amp;quot;s jealousy was standing.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">And all at once, the dazzling glory of the God of Israel appeared! It looked like what I had seen in the Euphrates Valley.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Then God said, &amp;apos;Son of man, look now to the north.&amp;apos; So, I raised my eyes to the north, and standing there, north of the pathway entrance of the altar gate was this vile statue that infuriates God .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">And he said to me, &amp;apos;Son of man, do you see what they are doing? Look at all the repulsive, loathsome things that the people of Israel are practicing here! Their disgusting deeds drive me farther and farther from my sanctuary. And you will see even more shocking things than these.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">He next transported me to the entrance to the outer courtyard. I looked carefully and noticed there was a hole in the wall.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">He said, &amp;apos;Son of man, dig through the wall.&amp;apos; When I dug into the wall, I discovered a doorway.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">He said, &amp;apos;Now, go in and look at the shocking, despicable things they are doing inside.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">So I went through the door, and I noticed the walls were covered with drawings of every kind of snake, bugs , creeping things, repulsive animals, and all the disgusting idols of the people of Israel.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Worshiping these animals were seventy leaders of Israel, and standing among them was Jaazaniah son of Shaphan. Each one had an incense burner in his hand, from which rose a fragrant cloud of incense.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">God said to me, &amp;apos;Son of man, have you seen what these leaders of Israel are doing in secret, each one worshiping in his own personal shrine? They say, &amp;quot;Oh, Yahweh cannot see us; he has left the land.&amp;quot; &amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Then God said, &amp;apos; This is not even the worst of the practices. You will see things more terrible than this.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Next he took me to the entrance of the north gate of the temple of Yahweh where women were weeping over the death of the god Tammuz.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">He said, &amp;apos;Son of man, do you see their worship of Tammuz ? You will see even more terrible things than that.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Next he transported me to the north gate to the inner court of his temple. And there, at the entrance to Yahweh &amp;quot;s sanctuary, between the porch and the altar, were about twenty-five men standing with their faces to the east worshiping the sun with their backs to Yahweh &amp;quot;s sanctuary. They bowed down to the east, before the rising sun.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">God said to me, &amp;apos;Son of man, do you see this? It is bad enough that the people of Judah are doing these despicable things, but they also spread violence throughout the land and provoke my anger further! Look at how they insult me in every possible way they can.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Therefore, with wrath I will deal with them. I will show neither pity nor mercy. They can cry to me as loudly as they want, but I will not listen to them.&amp;apos;</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="9">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Then I heard the Lord shout loudly for me to hear, &amp;apos;Executioners, draw near! Each bring your weapon of destruction!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Immediately six men advanced from the upper north gate, each one holding a deadly weapon. Also, I saw with them a man clothed in white linen, with a scribe&amp;quot;s case tied to his belt. They came and stood in front of the bronze altar.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Then the dazzling glory of the God of Israel rose from above the cherubim where it had been resting and moved toward the threshold of the temple. Then he called to the man dressed in white linen with a scribe&amp;quot;s case at his side,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">and Yahweh said to him, &amp;apos;Go throughout Jerusalem, and place a mark on the foreheads of all who grieve and are greatly distressed over all the disgusting things done in the city.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">He said to the executioners, &amp;apos;Go make my temple unfit for worship. Fill its courtyard with corpses. Now get to work.&amp;apos; They departed and began to strike the people throughout the city.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">While they were slaying, I was left alone in the temple . I threw myself facedown on the ground and cried out, &amp;apos;Oh, Lord Yahweh , are you really going to wipe out the remnant of Israel by venting your fury on Jerusalem?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">He answered me, &amp;apos;The guilt of the people of Israel and Judah is enormous. The land is full of bloodshed, and Jerusalem full of perverted justice. They say, &amp;quot; Yahweh can&amp;quot;t see us! He has abandoned the nation.&amp;quot;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">So, I no longer will show them any mercy nor give them one glance of pity. They hereby suffer the consequences of their own behavior.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Just then, the man dressed in white linen with the scribe&amp;quot;s case came back and made his report: &amp;apos; It is finished ; I have carried out your orders.&amp;apos;</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="10">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Then I saw a vision . On top of the dome over the heads of the cherubim, I saw something that looked like a sapphire throne.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Yahweh said to the man dressed in white linen, &amp;apos;Go among the whirling wheels below the cherubim and take a handful of burning coals from between the living creatures and scatter them over the city.&amp;apos; While I was watching, he went in among the whirling wheels .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">The cherubim were on the south side of the temple as the man went in, and the billowing glory cloud filled the inner courtyard.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">The dazzling glory of Yahweh rose from between the cherubim and rested over the entrance of the temple. The temple was filled with the cloud, and the court was full of the radiance of the glory of Yahweh .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">The noise of the living creatures&amp;quot; wings was as loud as the voice of God Almighty! The people could even hear it in the outer courtyard!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Afterward, Yahweh commanded the man dressed in white linen to go among the wheels and take fire that was burning among the cherubim. So, the man went among them and stood beside one of the wheels.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">One of the living creatures then reached his hand into the fire between the cherubim and took some fire and placed it into the hands of the man dressed in white linen, who took it and left.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">It seemed that the living creatures had what looked like a human hand under their wings.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">I saw the four wheels by the living creatures, one wheel beside each living creature. And the wheels sparkled like precious gemstones.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Each wheel appeared to be identical with another wheel inside it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">As the wheels moved, they would go in any one of the four directions the living creatures faced, without having to turn around. They went in whatever direction their head faced without turning as they went.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Their entire bodies, their backs, their hands, their wings&amp;ndash;along with all four of their wheels&amp;ndash;were covered with eyes all around.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">I heard a voice refer to the wheels as &amp;apos;whirling wheels.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Each living creature had four faces; the first was a cherub&amp;quot;s face, the second a human face, the third a lion&amp;quot;s face, and the fourth an eagle&amp;quot;s face.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Then the cherubim rose to the sky. They were the same living creatures I had seen by the River Chebar.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">When the living creatures moved as a group in any direction , the wheels followed them, and when the living creatures levitated off the ground by spreading their wings, the wheels did not leave their place beside them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">When the living creatures stopped, the wheels stopped; when the former rose, the wheels rose with them, since they shared the same living Spirit.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Then the dazzling glory of Yahweh departed from the entrance of the temple and hovered over the living creatures.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">They spread their wings, and before my eyes, I saw them levitate from the ground, with the wheels spinning beside them. Then they paused at the entrance to the eastern gate of Yahweh &amp;quot;s temple, with the dazzling glory of the God of Israel shining over them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">These were the same living creatures I had seen beneath the throne of the God of Israel by the River Chebar; I knew that they were cherubim.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Each had four faces, four wings, and what appeared to be human hands under their wings.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Each one moved straight ahead. Their faces were identical to those I had seen by the River Chebar.</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="11">
			<VERS vnumber="1">God&amp;quot;s Spirit swept me off my feet and transported me to the eastern gate of the temple of Yahweh . And behold, there at the entrance to the gate facing east stood twenty-five men, including the two officials Jaazaniah son of Azzur and Pelatiah son of Benaiah.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Then Yahweh said to me, &amp;apos;Son of man, these men are making evil plans to spread their wicked counsel throughout this city.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="5">Then the Spirit of Yahweh fell on me, and said to me, &amp;apos;Tell the people: &amp;quot;I, Yahweh , say to the people of Israel, I know what you think, your every secret thought.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="16">Now give this message to your fellow exiles: &amp;quot;The Lord Yahweh says to you: Although I have sent you far away among the nations and I have scattered you to foreign countries, yet I have been your sanctuary for the time being wherever you have gone.&amp;quot;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">And tell them, &amp;quot;The Lord Yahweh says this: I will gather you back from the peoples, and draw you together from the countries where you have been scattered and give you the land of Israel.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">When you return, you will purge the land of all its filthy idols and detestable practices.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="7">So, I did as I had been told. I packed my bag like an exile&amp;quot;s bundle, by daylight. And that evening, I dug a hole through the wall with my hands. Then while everyone watched, I shouldered my pack and went out into the dark.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">The next morning Yahweh spoke to me, saying,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">&amp;apos;Son of man, did not the rebellious Israelites ask you, &amp;quot;What are you doing?&amp;quot;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Answer them with these words: &amp;quot;Lord Yahweh says to you that this prophetic oracle from God concerns the ruler in Jerusalem and all the people who live there.&amp;quot;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">&amp;apos;Tell them, &amp;quot;I am a sign for you, for what I did is what is going to happen to them.&amp;quot; They will be deported into exile.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Their ruler will shoulder his pack, and they will dig a hole in the wall to let him out at night. He will cover his face so that he cannot see the land he is leaving.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">I will throw my net over him and trap him in it. I will take him to Babylon, to the land of the Chaldeans, where he will die without having seen it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">And I will scatter in every direction all his attendants, officials, and his armies, and I will chase after them with the sword.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">When I scatter them among different nations and peoples, they will recognize that I am Yahweh .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">But I will let a few of them escape the sword, plague, and food shortages. I will let them live so that they can describe all their terrible actions to the people in the lands where they will go. And they will recognize that I am Yahweh .&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Then Yahweh spoke to me, saying:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">&amp;apos;Son of man, eat your food with quaking and trembling. Shudder with fear as you drink your water.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Tell the people, &amp;quot;Lord Yahweh says this to the inhabitants of Jerusalem who remain in the land of Israel. They will tremble as they eat their food, and shake with fear when they drink their water because their enemies will strip the land bare on account of the violence of those who live there.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">When your populous cities have been destroyed and the countryside has been deserted, then you will recognize that I am Yahweh .&amp;quot; &amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Yahweh spoke to me, saying,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">&amp;apos;Son of man, what do you understand of the proverb you say among yourselves in the land of Israel, &amp;quot;Time goes by, and these visions never happen&amp;quot;?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">Very well, tell them, &amp;quot;Lord Yahweh says this: I will put an end to this proverb, and it will never be repeated in Israel again.&amp;quot; Tell them instead: &amp;quot;The time has arrived for every vision to come true,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">for there will be no more false visions or deceptive prophecy among the people of Israel.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">I, Yahweh , will speak the word, and what I say will come true without delay. For what I speak, I will accomplish in your own lifetime, you tribe of rebels. For I, Lord Yahweh , have spoken!&amp;quot; &amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">Yahweh spoke to me again, saying,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">&amp;apos;Son of man, behold, the people of Israel are saying that your visions and prophecies are about the distant future, not today . They say, &amp;quot;He is prophesying of times in the distant future.&amp;quot;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">So tell them, &amp;quot;Lord Yahweh says to you: There will be no more delay. My words will be fulfilled now! What I have prophesied will be done. Lord Yahweh has spoken!&amp;quot; &amp;apos;</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1">One day, some leaders of Israel came to me to consult about what God was saying . While they were sitting there with me,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Yahweh spoke to me, saying,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">&amp;apos;Son of man, these men have set up idols deep within their hearts. And they have set idols before their eyes, so why should I let them ask me anything?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">So tell them this, &amp;quot;Lord Yahweh says: If any Israelite comes to consult with the prophet despite a heart that worships idols and eyes looking on that which leads into wickedness, I, Yahweh , will answer that person directly. I will give the answer that is deserved because of the great extent of the idolatry.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">And in this way I hope to capture the hearts of the people of Israel who have all been estranged because of all their idols.&amp;quot;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">&amp;apos;Therefore, prophesy to the people of Israel, &amp;quot;Lord Yahweh says to you: Repent! Come back to me and forsake your idols. Once and for all, turn your backs on all your detestable practices.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="8">I will oppose that person! I will cut the idolator off from my people as an example and a warning to others. And then you will know that I am Yahweh .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">And if the prophet is tricked into speaking a prophetic word, it is I, Yahweh , who allowed this to happen, for I have decided to punish him with death.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Both the prophet and the one who consults him will be equally punished for their guilt.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">I will do this so that they will never stray from me again or defile themselves with their rebellion. Then they will be my faithful people, and I will be their faithful God. For I, Lord Yahweh , have spoken.&amp;quot; &amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Yahweh spoke to me, saying:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">&amp;apos;Son of man, suppose all the people living in a certain country wander from me in pursuit of their sin, then I decide to come against them. I would punish them by destroying their food supply, inflicting famine on them, and causing people and animals to starve to death.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Even if the three godly men, Noah, Daniel, and Job, all lived there, their righteous lives could only save themselves&amp;ndash;no one else. I, Lord Yahweh , have spoken.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="16">Even if these three godly men lived there, as surely as I, Lord Yahweh , am the living God, they would not be able to save even their own children. They alone would be spared, and the country would become a desert.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="18">Even if these three godly men lived there, as surely as I, Lord Yahweh , am the living God, they would not be able to save either son or daughter; they alone would be saved.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="21">Lord Yahweh spoke to me, saying, &amp;apos;How much worse it will be for Jerusalem when I send my four dreadful scourges&amp;ndash;sword, famine, wild animals, and pandemic&amp;ndash;to destroy both people and animals.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Even so, there will be a remnant left, a few who survive. Enemy soldiers will bring your wicked sons and daughters out of the city, and they will be brought here to Babylon .

			<VERS vnumber="1">Yahweh spoke to me, saying:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">&amp;apos;Son of man, how is the wood of the grapevine different than that of other tree branches of the forest?</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="4">Look, it is good only for building a fire. When fire burns off both ends and the middle is charred, is it useful for anything?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Even while it was intact, you could make nothing with it. When it&amp;quot;s burned and charred, it&amp;quot;s even more worthless.&amp;apos;</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="16">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Yahweh spoke again to me, saying,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">&amp;apos;Son of man, confront Jerusalem concerning all the despicable things they have done.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Tell them, &amp;quot;Lord Yahweh says to you: Your ancestral origins were in the land where the Canaanites lived. Your father was an Amorite and your mother a Hittite.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">On the day you were born, there was no one there to cut your umbilical cord or wash you clean in water. There was no one there to rub you with salt and oil or wrap you in a baby blanket.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">No one did anything to help you. No one felt sorry for you or showed sympathy for you. Instead, you were dumped into an open field and forgotten. From the day you were born you were rejected and unloved.&amp;quot; &amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">&amp;apos; &amp;quot;Then I passed by, and I saw you there squirming in your blood. And as you lay there covered with blood, I spoke over you: &amp;apos;Live!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">And I made you grow and flourish like the grass of the fields. You grew up and developed until you produced the most beautiful of features. You developed the breasts and hair of a young woman, but you were still quite naked and exposed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Then later, I passed by again and looked upon you. And behold, I saw that your time had come&amp;ndash;you were now old enough for love. So, I spread the edge of my robe over you and covered your nakedness. I gave you my sacred oath. I, Lord Yahweh , made a divine covenant with you, saying, &amp;apos;You will be mine,&amp;apos; and I took you as my own and promised to care for you .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Then I washed the blood off you and anointed you with fragrant oil.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">I dressed you in beautiful, embroidered gowns, fine leather shoes, a fine linen headband , and wrapped you in rich fabric.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">I adorned you with jewels, beautiful bracelets, and necklaces.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">I gave you a nose ring and earrings and placed a sparkling crown on your head.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">You were decked with gold and silver jewelry and dressed in luxurious linen and rich embroidered cloth. Your meals were feasts , made with the best bread, honey, and oil. You grew more and more beautiful, and you rose to be queen.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">And you became famous throughout the world because the splendor I lavished on you made your beauty perfect, declares Lord Yahweh .&amp;quot; &amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">&amp;apos; &amp;quot;But you became confident in your own beauty and used your fame to act like a prostitute. You offered your sexual favors to each one who came along&amp;ndash;and you became his!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">You took some of your fine clothes to decorate the tents on the high places where you worked as a prostitute.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">You also took your gold and silver jewelry, which I had given you, and made yourself male images and acted like a prostitute with them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">You took your embroidered clothes and used these to dress them up, and you offered them my sacred oil and my sacred incense.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">I gave you food made with the best flour, olive oil, and honey. But you offered it as a fragrant incense to these idols. I, Lord Yahweh , declare: that is exactly what you did!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">You even took the sons and daughters I had given you and sacrificed them as food for the idols. As if your prostitution was not bad enough,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">you slaughtered my children and burned them as offerings to idols!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">While you were doing the things I hate and behaving like a prostitute, you entirely forgot how you were when you were young. I found you naked and exposed, squirming in your own blood.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">&amp;apos; &amp;quot;Now I, Lord Yahweh , say you are doomed! Not only did you do these evil things,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">in every city square you built an elevated shrine for the worship of idols .</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="27">So listen, I have taken action to punish you and remove your portion of my blessing . I have put you at the mercy of your enemies, the Philistine women, who blushed over your lewd behavior.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">Still unsatisfied, you prostituted yourself to the Assyrians and played the harlot with them. But even then, you were not satisfied.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">You committed further acts of fornication with the Babylonians, that nation of merchants, but that still did not satisfy you.&amp;quot; &amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">&amp;apos; &amp;quot;I, Lord Yahweh , say: You make me extremely angry because of all these things that you have done. You have acted like a brazen prostitute who has no shame .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">You built an elevated shrine on every street to worship idols, put up your pavilion in every public square. But you are not like a common prostitute just out for the money.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">You are an adulterous wife who would rather have sex with strangers than her husband.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">Men will pay a prostitute, but you give presents to all your lovers! You bribe them to come from everywhere just to sleep with you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">You are so different from other prostitutes. No one came to ask you for sex. The men you slept with did not pay you, but you paid them. Therefore, you are worse than a prostitute!&amp;quot; &amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">&amp;apos; &amp;quot;Very well, Jerusalem , you whore! Hear the word of Yahweh !</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">Lord Yahweh says to you: You poured out your lust and are ready for sex. As a prostitute, you uncovered your genitals for your lovers and for all those disgusting idols. You killed your children to honor those false gods.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">&amp;apos; &amp;quot;Behold, I will bring together all your lovers to whom you gave pleasure&amp;ndash;all those you loved and all those you hated. Yes, I will bring them from everywhere, and I will strip you naked in front of them and let them see your genitals.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">&amp;apos; &amp;quot;I will judge you with the same death sentence of an adulterer or murderer and bring upon you the fury of my burning rage.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">I will hand you over to your &amp;apos;lovers,&amp;apos; and they will destroy your elevated chamber and pull down your sacred shrines. They will strip you of your clothes, take away your lovely jewels, and leave you stark naked.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">Then they will gather an angry mob against you who will stone you to death and hack you to pieces with their swords.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">They will burn down your homes and execute justice on you while many other women look on. I will once and for all put an end to your wicked harlotry&amp;ndash;no more paid lovers for you!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">&amp;apos; &amp;quot;Once my fury is exhausted with you, I will calm down and let my anger die away. Then I will not be angry anymore.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43">You have entirely forgotten how I treated you when you were young. And you have done nothing but provoke me, so now I, in turn, will cause you to suffer the consequences for your own behavior. And haven&amp;quot;t you committed such gross lewdness in addition to all your other shocking sins? I, Lord Yahweh , have spoken.&amp;quot; &amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44">Yahweh says , &amp;apos;Behold, all who quote proverbs will surely apply this proverb to you, Jerusalem : Like mother, like daughter.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45">Yes; you are a daughter exactly like your pagan mother, who hated her husband and her children. And you have become exactly like your sisters, who hated their husbands and their children. You and your sister cities had a Hittite mother and an Amorite father.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46">Your big sister is Samaria with her daughter- villages to the north of you. Your little sister is Sodom with her daughter- villages to the south of you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="47">Yet you were not satisfied to live as the people of Samaria and Sodom lived, copying all their wicked ways and imitating their loathsome practices. In very little time, you became more wicked than they were in all your ways.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="48">As surely as I, Lord Yahweh , live, your sister Sodom and her daughters never did the evil that you and your daughters have done.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="49">Behold, the guilt of your sister Sodom! She and her daughters were arrogant, gluttonous, and lived in carefree complacency. They never thought to help the poor and needy.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="50">They were proud, stubborn, and defiantly evil before me, and so I swept them away as you have seen.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="51">And yet Samaria never committed half the sins that you have. You have done more detestable things than they. When compared to all your gross practices, you have made your sisters seem innocent!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="52">So now you will bear the shame of your deeds, which provides a measure of justification for your sisters, since your sins are viler than theirs. They now appear more upright than you are. So, suffer the utter disgrace and humiliation of having made your sisters appear more righteous than you!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="53">&amp;apos;I will restore their fortunes; I will restore Sodom and her daughters. I will restore Samaria and her daughters, and then I will also restore your fortunes along with them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="54">You will be totally ashamed of yourself and bear disgrace for all you have done in giving them comfort.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="55">When your sisters, Sodom and her daughter-villages and Samaria and her daughter-villages, are restored to what they were, then you, too, and your surrounding villages will be restored to what you were.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="56">Jerusalem , did you not gloat in your pride over your sister Sodom</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="57">before your wickedness was uncovered? Now you are just like her! You have become the laughingstock of the Philistines, the Syrians, and all your neighbors who hate you and heap scorn on you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="58">You have brought this on yourself with your lewdness and your disgusting deeds. I, Lord Yahweh , have spoken.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="59">&amp;apos;For I, Lord Yahweh say to you: I will treat you as you deserve, for you have broken your marriage covenant and despised your promises to me .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="60">But I will remember my covenant that I made with you in the days of your youth. I will renew that covenant with you, and it will last forever.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="61">When you get back your older and younger sisters, then you will remember your ways and feel ashamed. I will make them like daughters to you, but not on the basis of my new covenant with you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="62">Yes, I will graciously renew my covenant with you, and then you will know me as Yahweh -God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="63">You may remember your wretched past and feel deep remorse, yet you will be reduced to silence when you realize that I have forgiven you for everything you have done. I, Lord Yahweh , have spoken.&amp;apos;</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1">Yahweh spoke to me again, saying,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">&amp;apos;Son of man, propose this riddle to Israel, and speak this parable to the people.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Tell them to guess the meaning of what I, Yahweh , have to say to them: &amp;apos;There once was this great eagle with huge wings, whose wingspan was very wide, with many beautiful colored feathers around its head. One day he came to the Lebanon Mountains, and taking a new branch of a cedar tree, He planted it there in a city of merchants. and planted it in a fertile field. He placed it like a willow tree by the side of a flowing stream. and its roots grew down deep into the soil. So, it became a vine, branching out and sprouting new shoots. with huge wings and many feathers around its head. And soon the vine bent its roots toward him and stretched its branches toward this eagle from the place where it was planted, expecting this eagle to nourish it. so that the vine could branch out, bear fruit, and become a wonderful vine. Will the vine thrive? Will not the first eagle come and tear out its roots? Will it not strip off its grapes so that all its foliage withers? Then, even weak ones could easily uproot it! Will it not wither in the fertile soil where it had grown?&amp;apos; &amp;apos;I will take the highest branch from a cedar tree. I will break off from the very top a tender shoot and plant it myself on a high and lofty mountain. Yes, in the shade of its branches the birds will make their nests. who brings the tall tree low and raises the low tree high, I, Yahweh , have spoken and have done it!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">he broke it off and carried it off to a land of traders.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Next, he took a young seedling from the land</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">The young plant sprouted until it became a low spreading vine. Its branches grew up toward the great eagle, by the side of a generous stream Will it not shrivel up when the east wind blows? where it will put out branches and bear fruit and grow into a stately cedar tree. Every kind of bird will find a home in it. who withers the green tree and makes the withered tree sprout again.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">But another great eagle appeared</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">The vine was planted in good soil,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">So I, Lord Yahweh , ask you:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Yes, it is planted&amp;ndash;but will it thrive?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Then Yahweh spoke to me again, saying,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">&amp;apos;Ask that tribe of rebels if they know the meaning of my parable. Tell them: &amp;quot;Listen, the king of Babylon swooped into Jerusalem. Then he carried away the king and top officials and took them off to Babylon.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">He took one from the royal family and made a treaty with him, forcing him to swear an oath of allegiance to him. He also carried off to Babylon the leading men of Israel</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1">Yahweh spoke to me again, saying,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">&amp;apos;Why do you keep repeating this proverb in the land of Israel: &amp;apos;The parents have eaten sour grapes, but the children are the ones with the sour taste in their mouths?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">&amp;apos;As I, Lord Yahweh , live, you will have no reason to repeat this proverb in Israel.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Listen, every human life belongs to me; both the parent and the child are mine. The one who sins is held responsible and will die.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">&amp;apos;Suppose a man is morally good, and his actions are righteous and honest.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">He does not take part in the heathen feasts on the mountains nor worship the false gods of the people of Israel. He does not commit adultery nor have sex with a woman during her period.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">He exploits and defrauds no one. He does not steal but generously feeds the hungry and clothes the needy.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">He does not lend at interest or take any profit. He refuses to do anything evil and gives honest judgment between one person and another.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">He keeps my laws and is honest in all that he does. A person like this is righteous, and he will certainly live. I, Lord Yahweh , have decreed it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">&amp;apos;But suppose he has a son who is prone to violence and bloodshed,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">doing what his father never did. He takes part in the heathen feasts on the mountains, commits adultery,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">exploits the poor and needy, robs, and defrauds others. He worships the false gods and engages in despicable practices</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">and charges exorbitant interest for profit when lending money&amp;ndash;such a person will by no means live. Because he committed all these appalling deeds, he will surely be put to death, and he alone will be responsible for his own death.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">&amp;apos;But suppose this evil man has a son who sees all the sins his father practiced, yet chooses not to follow his poor example</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">and refuses to take part in the heathen feasts on the mountains or worship the false gods of the people of Israel. He does not seduce another man&amp;quot;s wife,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">nor exploit nor defraud anyone. He does not steal but feeds the hungry and clothes the needy.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">He refuses to do anything evil and does not lend for profit or charge exorbitant interest. He faithfully keeps my laws and teachings&amp;ndash;such a person will certainly live and not die for his father&amp;quot;s sins.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">As for his father, because he practiced fraud, cheated, and robbed others, doing what is wrong among his people, he will most certainly die in his guilt.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">&amp;apos;Yet you ask, &amp;quot;Why doesn&amp;quot;t the child bear his father&amp;quot;s guilt?&amp;quot; If a person lives an honest and upright life and keeps my laws and faithfully follows my teachings, he will most certainly live.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">It is the one who sins who will die. A child is not to bear his father&amp;quot;s guilt nor a father his child&amp;quot;s guilt. Good people will be credited for their own righteousness and the wicked with his own wickedness.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">&amp;apos;However, if the wicked man renounces all the sins he has committed, obeys my laws, and does what is fair and upright, he will most certainly live and will not die.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="23">I, Lord Yahweh , say: Do you think I enjoy seeing the wicked die? I would much rather see him renounce his sins and live!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">&amp;apos;However, if the righteous man abandons his righteous ways and acts wickedly, and follows all the despicable practices of the wicked, should he be allowed to live? None of his righteous deeds will be remembered from then on, for he is guilty of being unfaithful to me, and he will most certainly die.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">&amp;apos;But you complain, &amp;quot;The Lord is being unfair. That&amp;quot;s not right.&amp;quot; Now people of Israel, listen to me: Do you think my way of doing things is unjust? Aren&amp;quot;t you the ones who are acting unjustly?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">When the righteous man abandons his righteous ways, does what is evil, and dies, he dies responsible for the wrong that he himself committed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">Similarly, when the wicked man abandons his wicked ways to do what is good and right, he saves his own life.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">Having considered his ways and having chosen to renounce all his former sins, he will most certainly live and not die.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">And yet the people of Israel say, &amp;quot;What the Lord does is not just.&amp;quot; Really? What I do is not just, people of Israel? Aren&amp;quot;t you the ones who are acting unjustly?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">So from here on, you people of Israel, I, Lord Yahweh , say to you: I will judge each of you by what he does. Repent, turn away from all your sins, or your own wickedness will be your downfall.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">You must get rid of all the guilty sins you have committed and clothe yourselves with a new heart and a new spirit. People of Israel, choose life!</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1">It was the seventh year, the fifth month, and the tenth day after our deportation to Babylon . Some of the elders of Israel came to request that I ask Yahweh for his message to them. As we sat together,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Yahweh spoke to me, saying,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">&amp;apos;Son of man, give the elders of Israel this message: &amp;quot;Lord Yahweh says to you: Are you really coming to consult with me? As surely as I live, I will tell you nothing. I, Lord Yahweh , have spoken.&amp;quot; &amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Then he said to me, &amp;apos;Judge them, Ezekiel! Bring a charge against them, son of man! Confront them over the disgusting practices of their ancestors!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Tell them what I, Lord Yahweh , say: &amp;quot;On the day when I chose Israel to be my people , I pledged my word to the tribes of Jacob, and I revealed myself to them in Egypt. I pledged my word to them and said: I am Yahweh your God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">That day I promised that I would bring them out of Egypt to a land I had searched out especially for them&amp;ndash;a land flowing with milk and honey, the most splendid land of all.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">And I said to them, &amp;apos;Every one of you, get rid of the things you love that I hate. Don&amp;quot;t make yourselves unfit for my presence by worshiping the idols of Egypt. For I am Yahweh your God.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">But they rebelled against me and refused to listen to me. Not one of them rejected the detestable things their eyes feasted on, nor did they give up the idols of Egypt. So in my anger, I decided to pour out my wrath on them and vent my anger against them in the midst of Egypt.&amp;quot;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">I acted to protect the honor of my name, so that I would not be profaned in the eyes of the surrounding nations who saw me reveal myself by bringing the Israelites out of Egypt.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">&amp;apos;So I brought them out of Egypt and led them into the desert.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">I gave them my laws and taught them my commands, so that they would follow them and live by them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">And I also gave them my Sabbaths as a sign between me and them so that they might know that I, Yahweh , am the one who sets them apart as my own.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">But the Israelites rebelled against me in the wilderness and refused to keep my laws and rejected my commands (the one who obeys my laws will live by them), and they completely dishonored my Sabbaths. I was about to vent my fury on them in the desert and destroy them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">But I chose to withhold my punishment for the sake of my holy name, that it not be profaned in the eyes of the nations who had seen my power in bringing the Israelites out of Egypt.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">So, I made a vow in the desert that I would not bring that generation into the most splendid land that I had given them, a land flowing with milk and honey.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">For they had scorned my commands, refused to keep my laws, dishonored my Sabbaths, and their hearts were attached to idols.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">In spite of this, I took pity on them, so I spared them from destruction and did not make an end of them in the desert.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">&amp;apos;I warned their children in the wilderness: &amp;quot;Do not follow the ways of your ancestors, do not practice their standard of justice, and do not defile yourselves with their foul idols.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">I am Yahweh your God. Keep my laws, obey my commands, and follow them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Keep my Sabbaths as holy days. Let them be a covenant -sign between me and you, to remind you that I am Yahweh your God.&amp;quot;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">&amp;apos;However, like their parents , the next generation rebelled against me; they refused to keep my laws and did not respect or practice my standard of justice so that they would follow my laws and live by them. They also dishonored my Sabbaths. So, in my fury I decided to punish them and pour out my anger on them in the desert.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">But I restrained myself to protect the honor of my name so that I would not be profaned in the eyes of the surrounding nations who saw me reveal myself by bringing the Israelites out of Egypt.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">Moreover, I made a vow to them in the wilderness that I would scatter them throughout the nations and disperse them into foreign countries.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">I did this because they had broken my laws, refused to obey my commands, dishonored my Sabbaths, and their hearts chased after the idols of their ancestors.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">And for this reason I gave them laws and regulations that resulted in punishment, not life.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">And because they sacrificed their firstborn children in the fire, I declared them defiled and unfit to worship me . I did this to fill them with revulsion so that they would know that I am Yahweh .&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">&amp;apos;Therefore, son of man, speak to the people of Israel in exile and say to them, &amp;quot;Lord Yahweh says to you: Here is another instance of your ancestors blaspheming me by their infidelity.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">When I had brought them into the promised land, they discovered all sorts of high hills and all kinds of spreading trees. That is where they offered sacrifices and made offerings to false gods that provoked my anger. That is where they burned incense and poured out drink offerings to false gods .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">So I asked them: What is this high place where you go?&amp;quot; &amp;apos; (So its name is called High Place to this day.)</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">&amp;apos;Say to the Israelites in exile , &amp;quot;Lord Yahweh says to you: Will you defile yourselves in the same way your ancestors did and act like a prostitute with your idol worship?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">For when you offer your gifts and sacrifice your children as sacrifices by fire, you defile yourselves with all your idol worship to this very day. Do you think you can come and consult with me? As surely as I live, I will not answer you. I, Lord Yahweh , have spoken!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">&amp;apos; &amp;quot;You are saying that you want to worship idols of wood and stone and be like the nations around you. But what you have in mind will never happen.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">As surely as I, Lord Yahweh , live, I warn you: I will continue to rule over you with a strong hand and with all my power and my wrath poured out!&amp;quot; &amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">&amp;apos; &amp;quot;You have been scattered into many different nations and lands. But with a strong hand and my mighty power and outpoured wrath, I will bring you back.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">I will bring you into the desert of many nations, and there I will enter into judgment with you face-to-face!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">Just as I entered into judgment with your ancestors in the wilderness of Sinai, so I now judge you. I am Lord Yahweh , and I declare this to you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">I will make you pass under the shepherd&amp;quot;s rod and take note of you, as a shepherd sorts his sheep . And I will bring you into the bond of the covenant.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">I will purge out the rebels from among you, those who sin against me. I will remove them from the land where they are exiled, but they will not enter the land of Israel. Then you will know that I am Yahweh .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">And now, you people of Israel, Lord Yahweh says: Go ahead, all of you, worship your foul idols, if that&amp;quot;s what you want to do. But later you will have to listen and obey me! Then you will no longer dishonor my holy name by worshiping your foul idols and bringing your offerings to them.&amp;quot; &amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">&amp;apos; &amp;quot;Lord Yahweh says: On the high mountain of Israel set apart for me, all the people of Israel&amp;ndash;everyone in the land&amp;ndash;will worship me. I will be pleased with you and accept your sacrifices to me. And there I will require your best offerings, all your best gifts dedicated to me, and your holy sacrifices.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">I will take you out from among the nations and lands where you have been scattered and gather you together. Then I will be pleased with you just as I am pleased with the sweet aroma of burning sacrifices. And I will put my holiness on display through you before the nations.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">And when I bring you back to the soil of Israel, the land that I pledged my word to give to your ancestors, you will know that I am Yahweh .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43">You will remember your ways and all the vile actions by which you have defiled yourselves, and you will be disgusted with yourselves for all the evil things you did.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44">And when I deal with you, not as you deserve because of your wickedness, but in a way that brings honor to my name, then you, the people of Israel, will recognize that I am God. I, Yahweh , have spoken.&amp;quot; &amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45">Then Yahweh spoke to me again, saying,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46">&amp;apos;Son of man, look toward the south and prophesy against the forests of the southern land.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="47">Prophesy to the southern forest, &amp;quot;Hear the word of Yahweh : Behold, I, Lord Yahweh , say to you that I am about to light a fire in you that will consume every green tree and every dry tree of your land! This blazing fire will not be extinguished as it spreads to the north and consumes everything in its path.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="48">Everyone will know that it was I, Yahweh , who started that fire, and no one will ever be able to put it out.&amp;quot; &amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="49">But I protested and said, &amp;apos;But Lord Yahweh , everyone is already complaining that I only speak in riddles.&amp;apos;</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="21">

			<VERS vnumber="8">Yahweh spoke to me again, saying,</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="25">Your prophets plot conspiracies as lions stalk their prey. They have devoured the people, enriched themselves by seizing their wealth and jewels, and left behind many widows.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">Her priests have violated my law and have no respect for what is holy. They have made no distinction between what is holy and what is common. They have not taught people the difference between clean and unclean; they ignore my Sabbaths, and I have been defiled among them.</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="23">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Yahweh spoke to me, saying,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">&amp;apos;Son of man, there once were two women, daughters of the same mother.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">While they were still girls, they became prostitutes in Egypt. Men caressed their breasts; their virgin breasts were first fondled there.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Oholah (Samaria) was the older and Oholibah (Jerusalem) her younger sister. I married them both, and they bore me sons and daughters.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">&amp;apos;Although Oholah was mine, she continued her prostitution. She lusted after her lovers, the Assyrians&amp;ndash;warriors</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">wearing uniforms of purple, governors, and officials. All of them were young and handsome and skilled horsemen.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">She was a prostitute for all the most important men of Assyria. She made herself unfit for my presence by worshiping all the idols of every man she had sex with.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">When she was a girl in Egypt, men fondled her breasts and made love to her often, pouring their lust upon her repeatedly. She did not give up her prostitution.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">&amp;apos;So I handed her over to the power of her lovers, to the Assyrians whom she lusted after.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">They stripped her naked, seized her sons and daughters, and killed her with the sword. She became notorious among women because of her punishment for her sins .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">&amp;apos;Her sister Oholibah saw all this, but she was even more depraved and a wilder prostitute than her sister.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">She lusted after the Assyrians&amp;ndash;warriors dressed to perfection, governors, and officials. All of them were young and handsome and skilled horsemen.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Then I saw that she was completely immoral; both sisters were equally corrupt.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">As soon as she saw them, she went wild with lust and sent messengers to them in Babylon to come and have sex with her .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">The Babylonians came to her, shared her love-bed, and defiled her with their lust. Once they had defiled her, she withdrew her affection and turned her back on them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">She exposed her naked body to everyone and showed them openly that she was a prostitute. Therefore, I turned my back on her just as I had done with her sister.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Yet she began sinking even deeper into her depraved sexual immorality, acting the way she did when she was a young prostitute in Egypt.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">She was driven by insatiable lust for Egyptian men, with genitals as large as donkeys&amp;quot;, ejaculating as forcefully as stallions.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">In that way, you were longing to repeat the debauchery of your youth, when men used to fondle your nipples in Egypt and played with your young breasts.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">&amp;apos;And so, Oholibah, Lord Yahweh says to you: &amp;quot;Behold, I will stir up all your former lovers against you, from whom you have withdrawn your affection. I will bring them against you from every side:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">the Babylonians and all the Chaldeans, men of Pekod, Shoa, and Koa, and all the Assyrians with them, young and handsome men, all governors, officials, and warriors&amp;ndash;all of them skillful horsemen.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">They will attack you from the north and advance on you with chariots, wagons, and troops, setting themselves against you on all sides with shields and helmets. I will commit to them the right to judge you, and they will pass sentence on you as they see fit.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">I will direct my fiery indignation against you and let them treat you with fury. They will slice off your nose and ears, and what is left of your people will fall by the sword. They will capture your surviving sons and daughters and burn them alive.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">They will strip off your clothes and rob you of your fine jewels.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">&amp;apos; &amp;quot;So I will put a stop to your debauchery and the habitual prostitution you began in Egypt. You will not view the Egyptians as your lovers anymore. You will never think of them again.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">For Lord Yahweh says: Now, I will hand you over to those you hate, those for whom you no longer feel affection.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">They will treat you with hatred, strip you of all that you have worked hard for, and leave you stark naked. Just as you were naked in your prostitution, so you will be naked when everyone discovers your debauchery and habitual prostitution!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">You have brought all this on yourself because you have played the whore with the nations and have made yourself unfit for my presence by worshiping their idols.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">Since you have followed your sister&amp;quot;s footsteps, I will put her cup of punishment in your hands to drink .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">The Lord Yahweh says to you: &amp;apos; &amp;quot;You will drink of the same cup as your sister, a large cup both deep and wide that contains much sorrow ! Drink it all , for it will lead to mockery and insults! It is a cup of horror and devastation, the cup of your sister Samaria. Then, in despair , you will smash the cup in pieces, gnaw on the shattered shards, and cut off your own breasts, once fondled by others . For I, Lord Yahweh , have spoken.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">You will be drunk with misery and sorrow.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">You will drain it dry.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">&amp;apos; &amp;quot;And so, Lord Yahweh says: Because you have forgotten me and have turned your back on me, you too will have to bear the consequences of your outrageous, depraved sexual immorality.&amp;quot; &amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">And Yahweh said to me, &amp;apos;Son of man, are you ready to render judgment upon Oholah and Oholibah and charge them with their detestable practices?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">They have been wicked adulteresses. Their hands are dripping with blood, and they have committed gross adultery with their vile images. They have even committed murder by offering up their children, who are mine, as burnt sacrifices to feed their false gods!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">Moreover, they have sinned against me by defiling my sanctuary and dishonoring my Sabbaths.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">The same day they sacrificed their children to their idols, they came into my sanctuary and made it unfit for worship. Yes, this is what they have done in my own house!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">&amp;apos;Worse still, they sent messengers to summon men from far away to come have sex with them , and they came. To meet your lovers you bathed yourselves, painted your eyes, put on your provocative clothes with your finest jewelry.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">You reclined on your sumptuous couch with a table spread before you with my aromatic incense and oils.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">The noise of your party, a carefree crowd, echoed all around&amp;ndash; a noisy crowd of drunk nomads ! They put bracelets on the women&amp;quot;s arms and magnificent headpieces on their heads.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43">I thought, &amp;quot;Isn&amp;quot;t that woman worn out with her adultery? Let them use her as a prostitute&amp;ndash;she&amp;quot;s a professional.&amp;quot;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44">&amp;apos;Yet the men continued to have sex with her as one does with a prostitute, just as they slept with Oholah and Oholibah&amp;ndash;those lewd women!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45">But there are righteous men who will declare them guilty of adultery and murder. For they are, indeed, adulteresses and their hands are stained with blood.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46">Lord Yahweh says: &amp;apos;Gather a mob to deal with them, to rob and terrorize them!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="47">Let the mob stone them and attack them with their swords. Let their sons and daughters be slaughtered and their houses set on fire.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="48">This is how I shall purge the land of lewdness so that all women will be warned not to commit prostitution as you have done.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="49">And you two sisters, you will be punished as your sins deserve. You will bear the price for your immorality and your vile idolatry. Then you will know that I am Lord Yahweh .&amp;apos;</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="24">
			<VERS vnumber="3">Pronounce this parable for these rebels: &amp;quot;Lord Yahweh says to you: &amp;apos; &amp;quot;Put a cooking pot on the fire ; put it on and fill it with water. kill it, cut it in pieces, Fill the pot with the most tender cuts, pile firewood underneath it and boil it until the bones are thoroughly cooked. for you are like a scum-filled cooking pot that no amount of scrubbing can make clean! Your people have poured the blood You didn&amp;quot;t bother to pour it on the ground I have put the blood of those you murdered on a bare rock where it will not be hidden! Doom is in store for the city of bloodshed. I, too, will pile up wood for the fire. until the bones are burned up! until it gets hot and the metal glows red-hot. The scum will become soft enough to scrub , and what is left will be burned off.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">&amp;apos; &amp;quot;For the Lord Yahweh says this:</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="12">But it still can&amp;quot;t be cleaned and its scum can&amp;quot;t be removed, so into the fire you go!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">&amp;apos; &amp;quot; Jerusalem , the filth of your sexual immorality is infamous. Although I have tried to purify you, you were not cleansed of your filth, so now you will never be purged of your filth until I have emptied out my fury upon you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">I, Yahweh , have decreed it. The time has come, and I will do it! I will not hold back or relent. I will show you no pity. I will judge you according to the way you have lived and acted. I, Lord Yahweh , have spoken.&amp;quot; &amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Yahweh spoke to me and said,</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="17">Let no one hear your sobbing; don&amp;quot;t show that you are grieving. Wrap a turban around your head, put sandals on your feet, and dress normally . Don&amp;quot;t cover your face, and don&amp;quot;t eat the customary food of mourners.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">So, I preached to the people the next day as usual , and by evening, my wife had died. And I did as I had been instructed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">The people then said to me, &amp;apos;What&amp;quot;s the meaning of this? Why are you acting this way?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Then Yahweh spoke to me and I replied, &amp;apos; Yahweh told me</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">to prophesy to the people of Israel the words of Lord Yahweh : &amp;quot;Behold! I am about to make my sanctuary ritually unclean. My temple has become your boast, the pride of your strength, the delight of your eyes, the joy of your hearts, and you believe it will keep you safe . But your children whom you left behind in Jerusalem will be killed by the sword.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Then you will do as I have done; you will not cover your faces nor eat the customary food of mourners.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">You will keep turbans on your heads and your sandals on your feet. You will not mourn nor weep but will waste away for your sins and groan among yourselves.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="26">And on that day a survivor from Jerusalem will bring you the report.</VERS>

For its roots were planted in plentiful waters. No cypress compares to such lovely branches as these; No tree in the garden of God could match its beauty.

			<VERS vnumber="3">Yet you eat the fat, you shear the sheep to make your clothes, you slaughter the fattest sheep for your feasts , but you never feed the flock.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">You haven&amp;quot;t cared for the weak ones, brought healing to the sick, nor bandaged those who are injured. You haven&amp;quot;t looked for the strays nor brought the lost back to the fold . Instead, you have ruled over them cruelly and treated them harshly.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Because there was no shepherd to care for the sheep , they were scattered and were eaten by every wild beast.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">My flock has wandered aimlessly over every hill and mountain over the face of the earth, and no one went to look for them or tried to find them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">&amp;apos; &amp;quot;Therefore, you shepherds, hear the word of Yahweh :</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">As surely as I live, declares Lord Yahweh &amp;ndash;my sheep have become the prey of every wild beast. Since there was no shepherd to protect my sheep, they have been devoured. My shepherds have not searched for my sheep; they have cared for themselves and not the flock.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Therefore, you shepherds, hear the word of Yahweh :</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Lord Yahweh says: Behold, I am against you selfish shepherds! I will hold you accountable for my flock, and I will demand that you return my flock to me. No longer will you feed only yourselves because I will rescue my sheep from your mouths. You will help yourselves to my sheep no longer.&amp;quot; &amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">&amp;apos;For Lord Yahweh says: &amp;quot;From now on, I will personally search for my sheep and look after them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">As a good shepherd searches after his scattered sheep, so I will look after my sheep and rescue them from wherever they have been scattered on the day of disaster.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">I will bring them back from foreign countries and gather them together as my flock and return them to their own land. I will feed them on the mountains of Israel, in the valley streams and in all the fertile places.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">I will feed them in fair meadows and on the slopes of the mountains of Israel. There they will lie down in good grazing grounds and graze in green pastures on the mountains of Israel.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">&amp;apos; &amp;quot;As for you, my sheep, Lord Yahweh says to you: I am the one who judges between one sheep and the other, between rams and billy goats.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Since you&amp;quot;re not satisfied with feeding from the best pastures, you also trample down the rest of the grass. You&amp;quot;re not satisfied to drink the clean water; must you also muddy up the rest of the water with your feet?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Is it right that my sheep have to eat what you have walked all over? Is it right that they must drink muddy water because of your trampling feet?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Therefore, Lord Yahweh says this: I am the one who judges between the strong sheep and the weak.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Because you shove with your side and your shoulder and thrust your horns at all the weak sheep until you scatter them, therefore,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">I will come and save my sheep and rescue them from being victimized. I will judge between one sheep and another.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">&amp;apos; &amp;quot;I will raise up one shepherd over them, like my servant David, and put him in charge of my flock to feed them. He will care for them and be their shepherd.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">I, Yahweh , will be their God, and my servant, like David, will be their prince taken from among them. I, Yahweh , have spoken.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">I will make a covenant of peace with them and rid the land of its wild beasts. Then they will be able to live securely in the wilderness and sleep soundly in the forest.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">And I will make them and the places all around my sacred hill a blessing. And I will send showers of blessing &amp;ndash;showers will come down in their season.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">And the tree of the field will yield its luscious fruit, the earth will yield its harvest, and they will live safely in their own land. When I set them free from slavery and rescue them from the hands of those who enslaved them, then they will acknowledge that I am Yahweh .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">Foreign powers will no longer plunder them; the wild beasts of the land will no longer feast on them. They will live safe and secure, with no one to frighten them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">I will establish for them a planting of renown so that they will no longer suffer from famine. And they will no longer have to endure the insults of other nations.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">So they will know that I, Yahweh , am with them as their God. And they, the people of Israel, will know that they are my people&amp;ndash;declares the Lord Yahweh .</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1">Yahweh &amp;quot;s powerful presence was upon me, and his Spirit lifted me up and carried me away. He set me down in the middle of a valley floor that was covered with countless bones.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">He made me walk all around the valley among all the vast piles of bones. There in the valley there were very many, very dry bones.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Yahweh asked me, &amp;apos;Son of man, can these bones come back to life again?&amp;apos; And I replied, &amp;apos;Lord Yahweh , you are the only one who knows.&amp;apos; &amp;apos; &amp;quot;I am now going to breathe into you, and you will live again! I will make flesh grow on you. I will cover you with skin. I am going to breathe into you, and you will live again. And you will know that I am Yahweh .&amp;quot; &amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Then he said to me, &amp;apos;Prophesy over these dry bones these words, &amp;quot;Dry bones, hear what Yahweh says.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="22">The people of Israel will know that I am Yahweh their God from that day forward and forever.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">The nations will also realize that the people of Israel went into captivity because of their guilt, for they were unfaithful to me. So, I hid my face from them and gave them over to the power of their enemies, whereby they were all killed in war.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">I treated them as their despicable deeds of infidelity deserved and hid my face from them.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">So, Lord Yahweh says this: &amp;apos;Now I will be merciful and bring Jacob&amp;quot;s captives back and show pity on all the people of Israel. I will be zealous to not let them dishonor my holy name.</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="40">
			<VERS vnumber="1">In the first month of the twenty-fifth year of our captivity, on the tenth day of the month, and nearly fourteen years after the Babylonians captured Jerusalem, on that day Yahweh overpowered me and carried me away to Jerusalem .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">In an ecstatic vision from God, he carried me away to the land of Israel and put me down on a very high mountain. As I looked toward the south, there was a group of buildings that seemed to be a city.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">And when he brought me closer to the buildings, behold, I saw a man standing in the gateway. His appearance was shining and glistening like polished bronze. He held a linen cord and a measuring rod in his hand.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">The shining man said to me, &amp;apos;Son of man, look closely and listen carefully. Pay close attention to everything I show you, for I have brought you here to reveal these things to you. You must tell the people of Israel everything you see.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Behold, I saw an outer wall surrounding the whole area where the temple stood. And the shining man was holding a measuring reed, and its length was six long cubits, each cubit a forearm and a handbreadth. He measured the wall with the reed, and it was one reed high and one reed thick.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">He went into the opening of the gateway facing east, climbed the steps, and measured its threshold as one reed deep.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Beyond the threshold was a corridor, which had rooms on each side for the guards . Each of the side rooms was square and measured one reed on each side. The space between the side rooms was five cubits. And the inside threshold of the gate leading to the portico facing the temple was one reed deep.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Then he measured the porch of the gate on the inside.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">It was eight cubits deep, flanked by pillars two cubits thick. The porch opened onto the temple courtyard.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">On each side of the east gate there were three guardrooms, all three the same size, and the walls that separated them were the same size.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">He measured the width of the entrance as ten cubits and its length, thirteen cubits.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">And there was a low wall one cubit high in front of the guardrooms. Each of the guardrooms was six cubits square.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Then he measured the width of the gate from the top back wall of one guardroom to the top back wall of the opposite one. It was twenty-five cubits straight across.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">He calculated the height of the porch, which led out to a courtyard, as sixty cubits high.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">From the outside wall of the gate to the far side of the porch, he measured as fifty cubits.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">On all the inside walls of the gateway were windows with narrow recesses all around. The walls of the guardrooms, the walls between them, and the walls of the porch likewise had windows all around. And there were palm trees carved on the inner walls of the corridor and on the doorways.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Then the shining man brought me into the outer court, and behold, there was a spacious terrace paved with stones, and thirty chambers were built against the outer wall.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">This paved terrace, or Lower Terrace, was as wide as the gateways were long and extended throughout the courtyard.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Then he measured the width of the courtyard, from the inside of the lower gateway to the outside of the inner court; it was one hundred cubits on the east side. Then he went to measure the north side.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Behold, there was a gate in the outer courtyard that faced to the north. He measured its length and width.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">The length of the gateway was fifty cubits, and its width was twenty-five cubits. Its pillars and porch were of the same size as those of the first gate. It also had three guardrooms on each side.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Its windows, its porch, and its palm trees were of the same measurement as those of the east gate. There were also seven steps leading up to it, and its porch was at the end facing the courtyard.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">In the inner court across from the north gate there was another gateway leading into the inner courtyard, just as there was opposite the east gate. He measured the distance from one gate to the other, and it was one hundred cubits.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">Next, the shining man took me to the south side, and behold, there was another gate. He measured its pillars and porch; they were of the same dimensions as the others.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">The gateway, as well as its porch, had narrow windows all around, like the windows of the others; it was fifty cubits long and twenty-five wide</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">and had seven steps leading up to it. Its porch was at the inner end and had palm trees carved on its pillars, one on either side.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">There was also a lower gate on the south side of the inner court. He measured the distance southward from one gate to the other as one hundred cubits.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">He then took me into the inner court by the south gate. He measured the south gate, and its dimensions were the same as the others.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">Its guardrooms, pillars, and porch were also the same size as the others.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">There were porches all around the gateway and each porch was fifty cubits long and five cubits wide.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">The porches all faced the outer court with eight steps leading up to them. And palm trees were carved on the pillars of the corridor.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">Then he took me into the inner court on the east side and measured the gateway. It was identical in size to the others.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">Its guardrooms, pillars, and porches were of the same dimensions as the others. The gateway, as well as its porch, had windows all around. It was fifty cubits long and twenty-five cubits wide.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">Its porch faced the outer court with eight steps leading up to it, and there were palm trees carved on its pillars.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">Then the shining man brought me to the north gate and measured it, and it had the same dimensions as the others.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">Its guardrooms, pillars, and porches were of the same dimension as the others. The gateway had narrow windows all around. It was fifty cubits long and twenty-five cubits wide.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">Its porch faced the outer court, and there were eight steps leading up to it, and there were palm trees carved on its pillars on either side.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">In each of the inner gateways there was a chamber with a doorway by the porch, where they washed the burnt offerings.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">And inside the porches of the gates there were two tables placed on each side, on which the burnt offerings, sin offerings, and guilt offerings were slaughtered.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">Outside the north gate, near the steps to the entrance, two tables were placed against both outside walls of the porches&amp;ndash;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">four tables inside and four tables outside, eight tables in all for slaughtering the animals for sacrifice.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">There were also four slabs of hewn stone used for the burnt offerings that were each a cubit and a half long, a cubit and a half wide, and one cubit high. The instruments used for slaughtering the burnt offerings and sacrificial animals were placed on these slabs.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43">And four-inch-long double-pronged hooks were fastened to the wall all around the stone tables . And the carcasses of the sacrificial animals were prepared on the tables.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44">Then he brought me into the inner courtyard just outside the north gate . Behold, I saw chambers for the singers of the inner court, one on the side of the north gate, facing south, the other on the side of the south gate, facing north.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45">The shining man told me, &amp;apos;The chamber facing south is for the priests responsible for the service of the temple.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46">And the chamber facing north is for the priests responsible for the sacrifices of the altar. These are the sons of Zadok, for only the sons of Levi are permitted to go into Yahweh &amp;quot;s presence to serve him.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="47">Then he measured the inner courtyard. It was one hundred cubits long and one hundred cubits wide, a square with the altar standing in front of the temple.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="48">Then he brought me to the entrance porch of the temple building, and he measured the gateposts of the porch. They were five cubits thick on either side, and the width of the gate was fourteen cubits. The sidewalls of the gate were three cubits on either side.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="49">The entrance porch itself was twenty cubits long and twelve cubits wide. There were ten steps leading up to it, and there were pillars by the gateposts, one on either side.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="41">
			<VERS vnumber="1">The shining man brought me to the Holy Place and measured its doorframes; each was six cubits wide.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">The width of the entrance was ten cubits, and the sides of the entrance were five cubits on each side, its length was forty cubits, and its width twenty cubits.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Then he went inside the innermost chamber and measured the doorframes at the entrance as two cubits, then the entrance as six cubits, and the width of the entrance as seven cubits.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">He measured its length and width as twenty cubits, at the end of the outer sanctuary. Then he said to me, &amp;apos;This is the Holy of Holies.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">He then measured the wall of the temple as six cubits thick. There were side rooms all around the temple that were each four cubits wide.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">And there were three levels of the side rooms, with thirty rooms on each floor. All around the wall of the temple were ledges that served as supports for the side rooms so that they did not have to be attached to the temple wall for support.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">The rooms were right up to the temple walls. The width of the side rooms increased, floor by floor, because the width of the temple increased as it got higher, from the lowest level through the middle level to the top level.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Then I looked down and saw that the temple stood on a raised platform that surrounded it. The platform was a full measuring reed high (six cubits) and provided a foundation for the side rooms.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">And the doors of the side rooms faced an open area, one door toward the north and one door toward the south. The width of the open area was five cubits wide all around.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">The building on the west side of the courtyard was seventy cubits wide. The wall of the building was five cubits thick all around, and its length was ninety cubits.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Then the shining man measured the length of the temple as one hundred cubits. The length of the courtyard plus the building and its walls was also one hundred cubits.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">The width of the courtyard on the east, including the front of the temple, was likewise one hundred cubits.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Then he measured the length of the building west of the courtyard, including its balconies on either side, which was also one hundred cubits. The entire inside of the Holy Place, the porches of the courtyard,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">the thresholds, the windows, and the galleries on three sides that faced the threshold were paneled with wood all around, from the floor up to the windows. And the windows were screened with latticework.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">On the door to the inner part of the temple and on all the walls all around, both inside and outside,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">were carved alternating cherubim and palm trees. Each of the cherubim had two faces,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">a human face that gazed toward the palm tree on one side and the face of a young lion turned toward the palm tree on the other side. They were carved throughout the temple everywhere.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">The Holy Place had the same pattern of cherubim and palm trees carved on the wall from the floor to the space above the doors.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">The columns of the doorway to the Holy Place were square, and the columns at the entrance to the Holy of Holies were similar.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">A wooden altar was there, three cubits high, two cubits long, and two cubits wide. Its corners, base, and sides were of wood. The shining man said to me, &amp;apos;This is the table that always stands in the presence of Yahweh .&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">The Holy Place and the Holy of Holies had double doors.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">Each of the doors had two hinged leaves that swung open in the middle.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">On the doors of the Holy Place were carved cherubim and palm trees just like those carved on the walls. There was a wooden roof over the outside of the doorway to the Holy Place.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">And there were niches with palm trees on either side in the front walls of the temple porch. And the side rooms of the temple also had canopies.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="42">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Then the shining man brought me northward into the outer court and brought me to the rooms opposite the temple courtyard and opposite the outer wall on the north side.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Along the front, the building was one hundred cubits long on the north side and fifty cubits wide.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">On one side of the building was the twenty-cubit-wide plaza of the inner courtyard. On the other side was the paved walkway of the outer courtyard. The building itself was three stories high and had balconies.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">And in front of the rooms was an inner passageway, ten cubits wide and one hundred cubits long, and all their doors faced north.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">The top-floor rooms were narrower than those on the middle and bottom stories of the building because the balconies took up some of the space of the lower stories.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">The rooms on the third floor had no columns like the pillars of the outer courtyard. That is why the top story was narrower than the middle and bottom stories. The rooms became smaller the higher they went.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">There was a wall in the outer courtyard, parallel to the rooms, that was fifty cubits long.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">The wall was like this because the row of rooms along the outer courtyard was fifty cubits long, while the row of rooms that faced the temple was one hundred cubits long.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">The shining man said to me, &amp;apos;The northern and southern rooms facing the courtyard are holy chambers, the place where the priests who approach Yahweh will eat the most holy offerings. Because this is a holy place, the most holy offerings will be stored there: the grain offering, the sacrifice for sin, and the guilt offering.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">When the priests have served inside the temple, they must first take off their priestly garments and leave them in the rooms before going out into the courtyard. Their priestly garments are holy, so they must change their clothes before going near other people.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">When the shining man had finished measuring the inner temple area, he took me out through the east gate and measured the outside wall of the temple compound.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Using his measuring rod, he measured all the east side as five hundred cubits total.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">He measured all the north side as five hundred cubits by the measuring rod.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">He measured all the south side as five hundred cubits by the measuring rod.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Then he turned to the west side and measured it as five hundred cubits by the measuring rod.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">And so he measured the temple compound on all four sides. The wall of the temple compound was five hundred cubits square, to mark the boundary between what was holy and what was common.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="43">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Afterward, the shining man led me to the gate facing east.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">And behold, I saw the glory of the God of Israel storming from the east with a roar ! A thunderous sound came with him like the sound of a great waterfall. All the ground was glowing brightly, illuminated by his glorious presence.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">This vision was like the one I had seen when he came to destroy the city and like those visions I had experienced by the River Chebar. Then I fell facedown to the ground.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">The awesome glory of Yahweh entered the temple through the eastern gate.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Then Yahweh &amp;quot;s Spirit lifted me into the air and set me down in the inner courtyard; and behold, I watched the glory of Yahweh like a cloud fill the temple.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">While the shining man stood beside me, I heard the voice of one speaking to me from inside the temple.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">And he said to me, &amp;apos;Son of man, this is the place of my throne, the place on which I will rest my feet, where I will live among the Israelites forever. And the people of Israel and their kings will never again drag my holy name through the mud. They will never disgrace me again by their spiritual prostitution or memorials to their dead kings</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">or by putting their threshold beside my threshold and their doorposts beside my doorposts, with only a wall between us. They have defiled my holy name by their despicable practices, so in my anger I put an end to them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Now they must put away their unfaithfulness of worshiping other gods and put away the corpses of their kings from my presence, and I will make my home with them forever.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">&amp;apos;Son of man, describe this temple in detail to the people of Israel so that they will be ashamed of their despicable deeds. Let them carefully study the perfect structure of the temple.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Then, if they truly express sorrow over their sins, explain to them the design and plan of the temple&amp;ndash;its exits and entrances, its shape, its arrangement, the entire design, and all its rules for operation. Sketch it out for them so that they can observe and understand the entire plan and follow all its rules.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">&amp;apos;This is the law of the temple: the mountaintop radiates his glory , therefore, all around the Temple Mount will be a most holy area. Behold, this is the most important law of the temple.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">&amp;apos;This is the measurement of the altar using the same unit of measurement as the rest of the temple: The base is one cubit high and one cubit wide, with a rim of one span around its edge. The altar itself is to be this high:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">from the base on the ground to the lower ledge, two cubits, with a width of one cubit. And from the smaller ledge to the larger ledge, four cubits high and one cubit wide.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">The altar hearth is to be four cubits high, with four horns projecting upward from the hearth,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">and the hearth a perfect square: twelve cubits long by twelve cubits wide.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">The ledge is also to be a square: fourteen cubits long and fourteen cubits wide on four sides with a rim around it of half a cubit, and its surrounding base one cubit. Its steps are on the east side of the altar.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Lord Yahweh said to me, &amp;apos;Son of man, here are the rules you must follow when the altar is built to offer burnt offerings and to splash on it the blood of the animals they sacrifice.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">You must give a young bull to the Levitical priests, the descendants of Zadok. They are the ones who may come before me to serve me and offer the bull as a sacrifice for sin, declares Lord Yahweh .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">You must take some of its blood and smear it on the four horns, on the four corners of the ledge, and on its surrounding rim. In this way you will purify it and make atonement for it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Then take the bull offered as the sacrifice for sin and burn its carcass in the appointed place outside the sacred area.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">On the second day, you must offer an unblemished male goat as the sin offering, and the priests must purify the altar again as they did on the first day with the bull.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">When you have finished purifying the altar, you must offer a young, unblemished bull and a young, unblemished ram.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">You must present them before me, and the Zadokite priests will sprinkle salt on them and offer them as burnt offerings to me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">Each day for seven days you must sacrifice to me a young male goat, a young bull, and a young ram as a sin offering. All of them must be unblemished animals.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">In this way the altar will be purified, cleansed, and consecrated for seven days.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">When the seven days of consecration are over, on the eighth day and each day afterward, the priest will offer burnt offerings and communion sacrifices on the altar on behalf of the people. And I will accept you and be pleased with you. I, Lord Yahweh , have spoken.&amp;apos;</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="44">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Then the shining man brought me back to the outer gate of the sanctuary, which faces east, but it was shut.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Yahweh said to me, &amp;apos;This gate must be kept shut. No one may open it or enter through it, since Yahweh , the God of Israel, has passed through it. Therefore, it must remain shut.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">The prince, and only the prince, may sit inside the gateway to eat his sacred meal in the presence of Yahweh . He must enter and leave through the porch of the gate of the outer courtyard .&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Then the shining man led me through the north gate to the front of the temple. And I looked and behold, I saw Yahweh &amp;quot;s glory cloud filling the temple. And I was awestruck and fell facedown to the ground.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">And Yahweh said to me, &amp;apos;Son of man, set your heart on what I am about to tell you. Look closely and listen carefully to everything I explain regarding all the laws and instructions about my temple. Pay careful attention to the entrance to the temple and all the exits from the sanctuary.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">And tell the rebels among the people of Israel, &amp;quot;Lord Yahweh says to you: Enough of all your despicable deeds, you people of Israel!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">You have desecrated my temple by admitting gentiles into my sanctuary who are uncircumcised in heart and body, allowing them into my presence while you offer the fat and blood of sacrifices to me. You have broken my covenant in addition to all the wicked things you have done.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Instead of keeping charge of my holy things yourselves, you have placed these gentiles in charge of my sanctuary.&amp;quot; &amp;apos;</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="1">
			<VERS vnumber="1">It was the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah when Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, marched on Jerusalem and besieged the city.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">My Lord gave Nebuchadnezzar victory over King Jehoiakim and permitted the Babylonian ruler to remove some of the sacred vessels belonging to the temple of the true God. Nebuchadnezzar carried them away to the land of Babylon and placed the sacred vessels into the temple treasury of his own gods.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Later, the king ordered Ashpenaz, his chief officer, to select a certain number of youths from royal or noble families of the Israelites</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">who would be suitable for service in the king&amp;quot;s palace. They were to be handsome young men without defect, well-versed in every branch of wisdom. They were to be intelligent, discerning, and qualified for royal service. Ashpenaz was instructed to teach them the culture , the literature, and the language of the Babylonians.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">The king provided them a daily allowance of the best food and wine from the king&amp;quot;s table. For three years they were to receive a thorough education, after which they would enter the king&amp;quot;s service.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Among these men of Judah were Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">But the chief official of the palace gave them Babylonian names: Daniel he called Belteshazzar, Hananiah he called Shadrach, Mishael he called Meshach, and Azariah he called Abednego.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">However, Daniel determined in his heart not to contaminate himself with the food and wine from the royal table, so he begged the chief official to exempt him from the royal diet.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Then God moved on the heart of the chief official to show Daniel favor and compassion.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">But he warned Daniel, &amp;apos;My lord the king has ordered your meat and drink, and I fear that he will notice if your face starts looking worse than the other men your age. You could put my life in jeopardy with the king.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Daniel then appealed to the overseer whom the chief officer put in charge over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah. Daniel said to him,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">&amp;apos;Test us, your servants, for ten days. Give us only seeds to eat and water to drink.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Then afterward, compare our appearance with those of the young men who eat the king&amp;quot;s food. Then you can decide what to do with us.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">So the overseer agreed to do what they requested and tested them for ten days.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">And when the ten days were completed, they looked healthier and had even gained weight. The four Hebrew young men were in better physical condition compared to any of the others who had eaten their food from the royal table.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">So the guard replaced their diet of royal food and wine with vegetables and water .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">God imparted insight and skill in every aspect of literature and science to the four Hebrew men. Daniel also had the unique gift of interpreting every kind of supernatural vision and dream.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">At the end of the period that the king had assigned for their training, the chief of the palace servants brought them to Nebuchadnezzar&amp;quot;s court.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">The king interviewed them all, and among all the young men, he found none to equal Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah. So, the king chose them to serve as his advisers.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">And when the king questioned them on any point of wisdom or understanding, he found them ten times superior to all the magicians and enchanters in his entire kingdom.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">And Daniel continued there in Babylon as a royal adviser until the time Cyrus became king.</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="2">
			<VERS vnumber="1">In the second year of his reign, Nebuchadnezzar had an ominous dream. It left him so disturbed that he could not sleep.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">So the king called for his magicians, enchanters, wizards, and wise men to tell him what he had dreamed. And they all came and stood before the unsettled king.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">He told them, &amp;apos;I&amp;quot;ve had a dream, and my heart is troubled. I want to know what my dream means.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">The wise men answered him in Aramaic: &amp;apos;May you live forever, O king! Tell your servants the dream you had, and we will gladly reveal its meaning for you.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">&amp;apos;My decision is final,&amp;apos; the king answered. &amp;apos;If you cannot tell me what I dreamed and what it means, I will have you torn limb from limb and turn your homes into garbage dumps.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">But if you can tell me what I dreamed and its interpretation, I will reward you with wonderful gifts and high honor in my kingdom . So now, tell me my dream and what it means.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">They again replied, &amp;apos;Let the king tell his dream to us his servants, and we will gladly reveal its meaning.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">But the king retorted, &amp;apos;I know what you&amp;quot;re doing; you&amp;quot;re just stalling for time! My decision is firm.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">If you do not interpret my dream for me, you will all receive the same punishment. You have conspired to continue deceiving me with your lies, hoping something will change. So, tell me now what I dreamed so that I can be assured that you are able to interpret it for me.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">The wise men answered the king, &amp;apos;There is no one on earth who could do what Your Majesty commands. Furthermore, no king great or small has ever requested such a thing of any magician, enchanter, or astrologer.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Your Majesty , what you ask is difficult, and it is impossible for anyone to reveal it except the gods, and they do not live with mortals.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">At this the king flew into a violent rage and ordered all the wise men of Babylon to be executed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">When the king&amp;quot;s decree was issued to have all the wise men killed, a search was also made for Daniel and his companions to have them put to death.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">As Arioch, captain of the royal bodyguard, set out to execute the wise men of Babylon, Daniel cautiously and tactfully approached</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">this royal official and asked him, &amp;apos;Why has the king issued such a harsh decree?&amp;apos; When Arioch explained all that had transpired,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Daniel immediately went off to plead with the king for more time so that he could seek the interpretation of the king&amp;quot;s dream.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Daniel then went home and explained everything to his friends Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">He urged them to beg the God of heaven for mercy to help them unravel the mysterious secret of the king&amp;quot;s dream so that Daniel and his friends would not be executed with the other Babylonian wise men.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">That night , God clearly revealed to Daniel in a night vision the mystery of the dream. Then Daniel praised the God of heaven,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">saying, &amp;apos;May the blessed name of God He enthrones and dethrones kings, I give you thanks and praise, for you have given me wisdom and power! You have revealed to us the king&amp;quot;s dream be praised forever and ever, for wisdom and might are his alone. he imparts wisdom to the wise, and he pours out revelation-knowledge to those with understanding. and knows what lies in darkness, for he radiates glory-light all around him. and unraveled to me its meaning.&amp;apos; And then a third kingdom will arise to rule the land, a kingdom of bronze.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">He alone controls the changes of times and seasons.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">He alone reveals deep secrets and mysteries</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">You are the God worshiped by all my ancestors;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">Then Daniel went back to see Arioch, whom the king had appointed to execute the wise men of Babylon, and said to him, &amp;apos;Do not kill the wise men. Take me into the king&amp;quot;s presence, and I will reveal the dream&amp;quot;s meaning to the king.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">Without wasting a moment, Arioch escorted Daniel to see the king. Arioch said to Nebuchadnezzar, &amp;apos;Your Majesty, I have found one of the Jewish exiles who can reveal the meaning of your troublesome dream.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">The king said to Daniel (whose Babylonian name was Belteshazzar), &amp;apos; Is this true? Can you tell me what I dreamed and what it means?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">Daniel replied, &amp;apos;None of the wise men, enchanters, magicians, or astrologers are able to unveil the mystery you have asked about,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">but there is an all-knowing God in heaven who reveals the deepest mysteries. Your Majesty, he is the one who has revealed to you what is to take place in the last days. Here is your dream, the vision that filled your mind as you lay in your bed:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">&amp;apos;Your Majesty, as you were going to sleep, your thoughts turned to what would happen in the future. The Revealer of Mysteries has disclosed future events to you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">This mystery has been revealed to me not because I am wiser than anyone else but for one divine purpose: so that you, the king, should learn what it means and that you would understand your innermost thoughts.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">&amp;apos;Your Majesty, you saw standing before you a huge statue of a man. It was both dazzling and terrifying to behold!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">The head of this statue was of purest gold, its chest and arms were of gleaming silver, its belly and hips of polished bronze,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">its legs of iron, and its feet were partly iron and partly clay.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">While you were staring at this statue, a boulder broke off from a mountain but not by the instrument of human hands. The boulder struck the statue at its base and shattered its feet of iron and clay into pieces.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">Then, all at once, the entire statue collapsed into a heap of rubble. The iron and clay, bronze, silver, and gold were all pulverized as fine as chaff on the summer threshing-floor. The wind blew the shattered pieces away, leaving not a trace behind. But the boulder that hit the statue grew into a massive mountain that covered the whole earth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">This was your dream. And now, we will explain to the king what it means.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">&amp;apos;Your Majesty, you are the greatest of kings. The God of heaven has bestowed upon you royal authority, power, might, and honor.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">He has handed over to you people, beasts, and birds, wherever they live, making you king of them all. You, O king, are the golden head.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">&amp;apos;And after you are gone , another kingdom will arise, a kingdom not as great as yours.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">&amp;apos;And there will be a fourth kingdom, strong and hard as iron. It will shatter all things in its way. Like iron that breaks everything to pieces, it will crush and break all the other kingdoms .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">&amp;apos;The feet and toes you saw, partly of iron and partly of clay, represent a divided kingdom that will retain some of the iron&amp;quot;s strength, just as you saw the iron and the clay mixed together.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">That its feet and toes were partly iron and partly clay means that this kingdom will be both strong and fragile.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43">And just as you saw the iron and the clay mingled together, so the people of this kingdom will seek to be united, but they will not bond any more than iron will permanently bond with clay.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44">&amp;apos;In the days of those kings of iron and clay , the God of heaven will set up an eternal kingdom that will never be destroyed nor ruled by other people. It will shatter and bring all other kingdoms to an end, and it will stand forever!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45">This is the meaning of what you saw in your vision: a rock cut out of a mountain&amp;ndash;but not by human hands&amp;ndash;a rock that shattered the iron, the bronze, the clay, the silver, and the gold to pieces is his eternal kingdom . The Great God has revealed to you , the king, what will take place after this. The dream is true, and its interpretation trustworthy.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46">Then King Nebuchadnezzar bowed low to the ground in awe of Daniel. Then he gave orders for incense to be burned and a sacrifice of grain to be offered in Daniel&amp;quot;s honor.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="47">The king said to Daniel, &amp;apos;Your god is without question the God of all gods, the Master of all kings, and the Revealer of all mysteries since he has given you the revelation of this mystery.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="48">Then the king promoted Daniel and made him great in the kingdom and gave him many wonderful gifts. He also made him ruler over the whole province of Babylon and the chief of all the wise men of Babylon.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="49">At Daniel&amp;quot;s request, the king delegated the affairs of the province of Babylon to his friends Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. Daniel remained in the king&amp;quot;s palace.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="3">
			<VERS vnumber="1">King Nebuchadnezzar had a golden statue made that was sixty cubits high and six cubits wide. He erected the statue on the plain of Dura in the province of Babylon.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">He then ordered an assembly of his princes, magistrates, and governors, as well as the counselors, treasurers, judges, sheriffs, and all the other provincial authorities, that they should be present at the dedication of the statue he had erected.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">So all these officials gathered in front of the golden statue that the king had made.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Then a herald made the loud proclamation: &amp;apos; Attention everyone! Listen to what the king commands of you&amp;ndash;you of every nation and language.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">When you hear the ram&amp;quot;s horn, and the music of the flute, the lyre, the ten-stringed harp, the triangular harp, the drums, and all the other instruments, you will bow down to the ground and worship the golden statue that King Nebuchadnezzar has made.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Whoever does not bow down to worship it will immediately be thrown into a white-hot fiery furnace.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Therefore, at the set time, as soon as they heard the musical instruments, those present from all nations and languages bowed down and worshiped the golden image that King Nebuchadnezzar had set up.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">At that point, certain Babylonian astrologers approached the king and maliciously denounced the Jews.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">They said to King Nebuchadnezzar: &amp;apos;O king, live forever!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">You issued a royal decree, O king, that when everyone hears the ram&amp;quot;s horn and the music begins they must bow down to the ground and worship the golden image.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">And whoever does not bow down and worship it will be thrown inside a white-hot fiery furnace.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Yet, the prominent Jews, whom you have appointed administrators of the province of Babylon, have greatly disrespected you, Your Majesty. Their names are Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. They do not serve your gods nor worship the golden image you have set up.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Upon hearing this, King Nebuchadnezzar flew into a furious rage and ordered Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego to be brought before him. When these men came before the king,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">he asked them, &amp;apos;Is it true, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, that you do not serve my gods or worship the golden statue that I erected?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">I now give you one more chance . When you hear the ram&amp;quot;s horn and the music of the flute, the lyre, the ten-stringed harp, the triangular harp, the drums, and all the other instruments, you will bow down to the ground and worship the golden statue I have made. But if you refuse to worship it, you will be thrown immediately into a white-hot fiery furnace. So now, who is the god that can save you from my power?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego answered King Nebuchadnezzar: &amp;apos;We have no need to offer you a defense in this matter.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">If the God we serve truly exists, then he will save us from death at your hand, O king. So, if you throw us into the fiery furnace, our God is able to save us.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">But even if he does not save us, you can be sure, O king, that we would not serve your gods or worship the golden statue you have erected.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Upon hearing this, Nebuchadnezzar was filled with anger, and his face was distorted with rage against Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. He ordered his men to heat the fiery furnace seven times hotter than it usually was.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">He also commanded some of his mighty men to bind Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego and throw them into the white-hot furnace.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Immediately, they tied up the three men while they still had on all their clothes&amp;ndash;their trousers, shirts, and turbans&amp;ndash;and then threw them into the white-hot furnace.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">But because the king&amp;quot;s command was so urgent and the furnace so overheated, the raging flames burned up the men who carried Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego into the fire.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">And the three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, tied and bound, fell inside the blazing, white-hot furnace.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">Suddenly King Nebuchadnezzar jumped up in amazement and asked his officials, &amp;apos;Didn&amp;quot;t we throw three men, bound in fetters, into the fire?&amp;apos; &amp;apos;That is correct, Your Majesty,&amp;apos; they answered him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">&amp;apos;But look,&amp;apos; he shouted , &amp;apos;I see four men walking about freely in the fire. They&amp;quot;re all unharmed! And the fourth man has the appearance of a son of the gods!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">Then Nebuchadnezzar cautiously approached the opening of the white-hot blazing furnace and shouted , &amp;apos;Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, servants of the Great God, come out here now!&amp;apos; So out of the midst of the fire walked Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego completely unharmed .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">When all the kings&amp;quot; officials had assembled, along with the princes, magistrates, and governors, they discovered that the fire had not harmed these three men. Their hair was not singed, their clothes were not scorched, and they didn&amp;quot;t even smell like smoke.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">King Nebuchadnezzar said, &amp;apos;Praise be to the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego! For he sent his divine messenger to rescue his servants who trusted in him. They disobeyed my orders and laid their lives on the line rather than serve or worship any god but their own.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">So I hereby make this decree: Any person from any nation or language who says anything against the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego will be torn limb from limb, and his house will be destroyed, because there is no other god who is able to rescue so miraculously !&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">Then the king promoted Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego in the province of Babylon.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="4">
			<VERS vnumber="1">King Nebuchadnezzar, to all peoples, nations, and language groups in the land: &amp;apos;I wish you perfect peace and prosperity! How overwhelming are his wonders! His kingdom will last forever, and his dominion endures from one generation to the next.&amp;apos; Belteshazzar answered, &amp;apos;My lord, if only the dream applied to those who hate you and its interpretation were for your enemies! &amp;apos;Here is my verdict concerning you, King Nebuchadnezzar: I have now taken your kingdom from you! &amp;apos;His kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and his dominion endures from one generation to the next. He does whatever he pleases with the armies of heaven and with those who dwell on earth. No one can restrain his mighty hand or dare ask him, &amp;quot;What are you doing?&amp;quot; I was restored to my right mind. The Most High gave me back the majesty and splendor of my kingdom. My advisers and noblemen came looking for me. I was restored to my throne, and still more greatness was added to me. praise, extol, and glorify God , the King of heaven! All his works are right and true, and all his ways are right.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">It is my royal pleasure to inform you of the mighty signs and wonders that the Most High God has performed for me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">&amp;apos;How great are his signs!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">&amp;apos;I, Nebuchadnezzar, was content and at peace in my house&amp;ndash;thoroughly enjoying a life of luxury in my palace.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">One night , I had a terrifying dream. While I was lying on my bed, frightening visions passed through my head, and I was tormented by what I saw.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">So I issued a decree that all the sages of Babylon must come and explain to me what my dream meant.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Magicians, enchanters, wizards, and wise men came, and I explained my dream to them, but they were unable to interpret it for me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Finally, Daniel came before me. (I had renamed him Belteshazzar, after my own god.) The spirit of the holy gods resides in him. I then told Daniel my dream:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">&amp;apos;Belteshazzar, chief of all my wise men, I know that the spirit of the holy gods resides in you and that there is no mystery that you cannot solve. So, listen to my dream and tell me what it means.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">&amp;apos;While I slept, these visions passed through my mind: I saw a huge tree in the midst of the earth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">And the tree grew taller and stronger until its top reached into the heavens, and it could be seen from the far reaches of the land.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Its branches and foliage were beautiful, its fruit abundant, providing enough food for all. Animals rested under its shade, and birds found shelter in its sturdy branches. All living creatures were nourished from it.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">&amp;apos;While I was still asleep, I saw another vision: I saw a watcher, a holy one, come down from heaven.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">At the top of his voice, he announced: &amp;quot;Cut down the tree, lop off its branches, strip off its leaves, and scatter its fruit. Drive away the animals from beneath its shelter and the birds from its branches.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">But leave the stump with its roots in the ground. Encircle it with chains of iron and bronze, surrounded by the grass of the field. Night after night , let him be damp with heaven&amp;quot;s dew. Let him live with the animals among the plants of the earth as his appointed lot. Let him eat the grass of the field.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">For seven years, let his mind be altered into the mind of a beast.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Such is the sentence decreed by the watchers, the decision by the word of the holy ones, so that everyone living may learn that the Most High God is sovereign over the kingdoms of men. He can give them to whomever he pleases and raises up over them the lowliest of all people.&amp;quot; &amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Then King Nebuchadnezzar concluded, &amp;apos;That was my dream. Now it is for you, Belteshazzar, to interpret its meaning, since not one of the wise men in my kingdom has been able to interpret it for me, but I know that you can, since the spirit of the holy gods resides in you.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Upon hearing this, Daniel (known as Belteshazzar) was visibly shaken for a while and troubled in his thoughts. The king noticed this and said to him, &amp;apos;Belteshazzar, do not be alarmed by the dream and its meaning.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">The huge tree you saw, so large and tall that it reached into the heavens and could be seen from anywhere in the land,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">the tree with beautiful branches and foliage and abundant fruit, providing food for all and shade for the wild animals, and birds with nests in its branches:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">that tree, Your Majesty, is you! You are now so great and strong that it reaches into heaven, and your authority reaches over the entire land.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">&amp;apos;Now you, O king, saw a watcher&amp;ndash;a holy messenger&amp;ndash;come down from heaven, saying, &amp;quot;Cut the tree down and destroy it, but leave the stump and roots in the ground. Encircle it with chains of iron and bronze in the midst of the grass of the field. Let him be damp with the dew every night. Let him live with the animals among the plants of the earth as his appointed lot until seven years have passed by for him.&amp;quot;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">So, the meaning of what you saw, Your Majesty, and the decree the Most High has decreed over you, my lord the king, is this:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">&amp;apos;You will be driven far from human society and will make your home with the wild beasts for seven years. Like cattle, you will eat grass, and you will be damp with the dew of heaven, until you have learned that the Most High is sovereign over the kingdoms of men and can give them to whomever he pleases.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">&amp;apos;And the watcher&amp;quot;s order, &amp;quot;Leave the stump with its roots in the ground,&amp;quot; means this: God will restore your kingdom to you once you come to your senses and understand that Heaven rules over all.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">&amp;apos;Your Majesty, please be willing to do what I say and accept my advice. Renounce your sins by doing what is right. Turn from your wickedness by showing mercy to the poor and unfortunate, and perhaps your prosperity will continue.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">All that was predicted happened to King Nebuchadnezzar.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">A year later, while strolling on the roof of his royal palace in Babylon,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">the king began to boast: &amp;apos; Look at you! Is not this Babylon the great? By my brilliant wisdom, I built all this as my royal residence to display the glory of my majesty.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">The words were no sooner out of his mouth than a voice spoke from out of heaven:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">You will be driven far from human society for seven years. You will make your home with the wild beasts, and you will eat grass like cattle until you have learned that I , the Most High, am sovereign over the kingdoms of men and can give them to whomever I please.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">It was no sooner said than done: Nebuchadnezzar was forced to live like a wild animal and was driven far from human society and ate grass as cattle do. Night after night he was damp with the dew of heaven, his hair grew remarkably long like eagle&amp;quot;s feathers , and his nails became like a bird&amp;quot;s talons .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">&amp;apos;When the appointed time had come, I, Nebuchadnezzar, raised my eyes to heaven, and my sanity returned to me. And I blessed the Most High, praising and glorifying him who lives forever:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">All who dwell on earth are regarded as nothing compared to him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">At the moment I began to praise him,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">And now I, Nebuchadnezzar, He knows how to humble those who strut around in pride.&amp;apos;</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="5">
			<VERS vnumber="1">When Belshazzar was king, he invited a thousand of his nobles to a state banquet, where the wine flowed freely among all his guests.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">While Belshazzar was drinking his wine, he gave orders to bring in the gold and silver vessels that his predecessor Nebuchadnezzar had taken from the temple of Jerusalem. He was wanting to drink from them along with all his guests&amp;ndash;his nobles, his wives, and his concubines.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">So they brought in the sacred gold vessels that were seized from the house of God in Jerusalem, and the king, his nobles, his wives, and his concubines all drank from them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">As they all drank their wine, they praised their man-made gods of gold and silver, bronze and iron, wood and stone.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Then all at once, a human hand appeared out of thin air , and its finger began writing on the white-washed wall of the palace, illuminated by the lampstand nearby. When the king witnessed this strange hand as it was writing,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">terror gripped him! The color drained from his face, his knees began to knock together, and he wet himself.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">The king shouted out, &amp;apos;Bring in the astrologers, wise men, and enchanters.&amp;apos; And when they came before him, he said to all the wise ones of Babylon, &amp;apos;I will make rich and famous anyone who can read this handwriting on the wall and tell me its interpretation. He will wear the purple robes of royalty and wear a golden collar on his neck, and I will make him the third highest ruler in my kingdom.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">All the king&amp;quot;s wise men came forward to examine the wall , but not one could read the writing or tell the king what it meant.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">King Belshazzar grew more and more terrified, his face turned ashen, and all his nobles were dumbfounded.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">When the queen mother heard the uproar among the king and his nobles, she entered the banquet hall and said, &amp;apos;Long live the king! Do not be so alarmed. Why are you so pale?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">There is a mighty man in your kingdom who has the spirit of the holy gods in him. During your predecessor&amp;quot;s reign, he was found to have light, brilliant insight, and godlike wisdom. It was, in fact, your predecessor King Nebuchadnezzar, who made him chief of the wise men, enchanters, astrologers, and diviners.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">This man Daniel, whom the king named Belteshazzar, has an extraordinary spirit and is full of revelation and understanding. He possesses a rare ability to interpret dreams, unravel mysteries, and find solutions to impossible problems. So send for Daniel, and he will reveal to you what this handwriting means.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Then Daniel was brought into the presence of King Belshazzar, and the king asked him, &amp;apos;So, you are the Daniel of the Jewish exiles my predecessor brought here from Judah?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">I have heard so much about you. I&amp;quot;ve been told that you have the Spirit of God and that you possess divine illumination, brilliant insight, and extraordinary wisdom.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Now, I have already brought in my wise men and astrologers before me, that they might read this inscription and give me its interpretation, but they were unable to show me what the words mean.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">However, I have heard that you are able to interpret dreams and that you have solutions for impossible problems. If you, then, can read the handwriting and tell me what it means, you will wear purple robes of royalty and a golden collar on your neck, and you will become the third most powerful ruler in the kingdom.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Then Daniel answered the king, &amp;apos;You may keep your rewards or give your gifts to someone else. But I will clear up for you the mystery of this handwriting on the wall .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">As for you, O king, the Most High God gave your predecessor Nebuchadnezzar kingship, greatness, honor, and majesty.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">God made him so great that people everywhere&amp;ndash;people from every nation, tribe, and language group&amp;ndash;trembled with fear and dread of him. He killed or spared whomever he pleased, and he exalted or humbled whomever he wished.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">But when his heart was inflated with pride and his spirit hardened into stubbornness, God deposed him from his royal throne and stripped him of his glory.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">He was driven away from civilization, for his mind became like that of a beast. He lived with the wild donkeys and ate grass like an ox. His body was bathed with the dew of heaven until finally he acknowledged that the Most High God has dominion over the kingdoms of men and sets over them anyone he wishes.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">&amp;apos;Yet you, his successor Belshazzar, you have not humbled your heart even though you knew all this.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">Instead, you lifted yourself up above the sovereign Lord of the heavens. And you brought into your banquet hall the vessels of his temple so that you and your nobles, your wives, and your concubines might drink wine from them. You lifted praises to your gods of gold and silver, of bronze and iron, of wood and stone, who do not see or hear or know anything; but the God who controls your very life breath and every move you make you did not glorify.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">This is why God sent the hand that wrote the inscription upon the wall.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">&amp;apos;The words inscribed are: Mene , Mene , Teqel , Parsin .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">And here is what they mean: &amp;apos; Mene : God has numbered the days of your reign and brought it to an end.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">&amp;apos; Teqel : God has weighed you in the balance, and you have been found lacking.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">&amp;apos; Peres : God has divided up your kingdom and given it to the Medes and the Persians.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">Immediately Belshazzar ordered Daniel to be clothed in a royal purple robe, to have a golden collar placed around his neck, and to be proclaimed the third highest ruler in the kingdom.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">That very night, the Babylonian King Belshazzar was killed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">So Darius the Mede received the kingdom when he was sixty-two years old.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="6">
			<VERS vnumber="1">After he became king , Darius the Mede decided to subdivide his kingdom into 120 provinces and strategically appointed a governor for each province.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">He also appointed three chief officials to watch over the work of these governors so that the king&amp;quot;s interests might not suffer, and Daniel was one of these three.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Now Daniel had an extraordinary spirit and possessed exceptional qualities. He so distinguished himself among all the chief officials and the governors that Darius intended to set him over his entire kingdom.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">For that reason, the chief officials and the governors were stirred to seek some pretext against Daniel regarding his governmental affairs. But because he was trustworthy, no one could find any error or fault in him nor could they uncover any negligence or misconduct.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Finally, his accusers said to themselves, &amp;apos;We will never find grounds for accusation against this Daniel unless it is related to his obedience to the law of his God.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">So these 122 powerful politicians consulted together as a group to entrap Daniel . And they went to speak to the king and said to him, &amp;apos;King Darius, live forever!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">All the officials of your kingdom&amp;ndash;your high officials, administrators, advisers, and governors&amp;ndash;we are all agreed that by royal decree the following prohibition should be enforced strictly: for thirty days, no one is to pray to any god or man except to you, O king; otherwise, he must be thrown into the lions&amp;quot; den.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Now therefore, let the king issue this written, irrevocable decree that cannot be altered according to the unchanging law of the Medes and the Persians.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">So King Darius signed the written decree.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Even after Daniel learned that the king had officially signed his decree, he continued his regular custom of praying at three set times a day. He went to the upper chamber of his house and opened the windows facing toward Jerusalem. Then he got down on his knees to pray, and he offered his grateful praise to God as he always had done.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Then all those who conspired against Daniel came and spied on him. They found him praying to God and asking him for help.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">So they approached the king and reminded him of his royal decree: &amp;apos; Your Majesty , did you not sign a decree forbidding everyone for thirty days to pray to any god or man except to you, O king, under penalty of being thrown into the lions&amp;quot; den?&amp;apos; &amp;apos; Yes, I did , and my decree is final,&amp;apos; the king answered. &amp;apos;It is irrevocable according to the law of the Medes and Persians.&amp;apos; &amp;apos;May peace and prosperity be greatly multiplied to you! all people everywhere will tremble in fear before the God whom Daniel worships. He is the living God, enduring forever. His kingdom will never be destroyed, and his dominion continues without end. He performs astonishing miracles in heaven and on earth, He alone has rescued Daniel from the claws of the lions.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">They then told the king, &amp;apos; We discovered that Daniel, one of the foreign Jewish exiles, pays no heed to you, O king, and ignores the decree you have signed. For he prays to his God three times a day.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">When King Darius heard this, he was deeply grieved and sought to find a way he could rescue Daniel from his fate . For most of that day until sundown, he wrestled within himself over how Daniel could be spared.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">But these powerful politicians went back to see the king and insisted, &amp;apos;Bear in mind, Your Majesty, that according to the law of the Medes and Persians, every edict or decree of the king is irrevocable.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">So, the king gave orders to have Daniel brought in and cast into the lions&amp;quot; den. But before they threw him into the lions&amp;quot; den, the king said to Daniel, &amp;apos;Your God, whom you serve so faithfully, he will surely come to rescue you.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">A large stone was then brought and placed over the opening of the den, and the king sealed it with his own signet ring and with the signet rings of each of his nobles so that Daniel&amp;quot;s fate might not be changed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Then the king returned to his palace, where he spent the night fasting; he had no supper brought to him and could not sleep a wink.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">At the first sign of dawn, the king rose from his bed and hurried off to the lions&amp;quot; den.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">As he drew near the den of lions, he called out to Daniel with a trembling voice: &amp;apos;O Daniel, servant of the living God, has your God, whom you serve so faithfully, been able to rescue you from the lions?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Then he heard a voice; it was Daniel&amp;ndash;he was still alive! &amp;apos;O king, live forever,&amp;apos; answered Daniel.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">&amp;apos;My God sent his angel, who sealed the mouths of the lions. I am unharmed and without a scratch . For I have been found innocent before my God and before you, too, O king. I have committed no wrong.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">The king was beside himself with joy! And he gave orders to have Daniel taken up out of the lions&amp;quot; den. When the servants brought him up from the den, they could find no trace of injury on his body because he had trusted in his God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">Then at the king&amp;quot;s command, those politicians who had maliciously plotted against Daniel, along with their wives and children, were arrested and flung into the lions&amp;quot; den. And before they reached the bottom, the lions pounced on them and devoured them, bones and all.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">After that, King Darius wrote the following to all the people groups of his kingdom , those of every nation, tribe, and tongue throughout the land:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">I hereby decree that throughout my royal dominion,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">He is a mighty savior and deliverer.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">From then on, Daniel prospered greatly during the reign of Darius and during the reign of Cyrus the Persian.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="7">
			<VERS vnumber="1">During the first year of the reign of King Belshazzar of Babylon, I , Daniel, had a dream filled with visions while I lay on my bed. So, I wrote down my dream, describing in full all that I had seen.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Suddenly, in my night vision, I saw the four winds of the heavens burst forth upon the great sea.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Then emerging from the tossing sea came four immense beasts, each different from the others.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">The first one was like a winged lion, with wings like an eagle. As I watched, its wings were plucked off, and it was lifted up from the earth, standing on two feet like a person, and it was given a human heart.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Then the second beast I saw resembled a bear. It was half crouching and had three ribs clenched between its fangs. It was told, &amp;apos;Stand up and devour more flesh.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">After that, as I looked on, behold, there was another one that looked like a tiger. On its back were four large wings of a bird. This beast had four heads, and it was given authority for dominion.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Then in my night vision, behold, I saw a fourth beast! It was dreadful, terrifying, and incredibly powerful. It had huge iron teeth used for crushing and devouring its victims . With its massive feet it trampled on what was left. It had ten horns and was totally different from the other beasts.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">As I was wondering about the horns, suddenly, another little horn sprouted up among them and tore out by the roots three of the previous horns to make room for it. On this little horn there were eyes like that of a man and a mouth boasting arrogantly.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">As I looked on, I observed a heavenly courtroom . Various thrones were being arranged until the Ancient of Days took his seat. His clothing was as white as snow, and his hair was white like perfectly clean wool. His throne was a tempest of fiery flames, set upon wheels of blazing fire.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">A surging stream of fire flowed from before him. Immeasurable numbers of people were serving him, and countless myriads were attending him. The court convened for judgment, and the books were opened.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">As I kept on looking, I heard boastful words being spoken by the little horn. As I watched, the verdict was issued . The fourth beast was killed, and its body was thrown into the blazing fire.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">As for the rest of the beasts, their dominion had been taken away, but they were allowed to continue living for an appointed time.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Then, as I was looking on in my night visions, suddenly I saw one like a son of man coming in the midst of the clouds of heaven. He was ushered into the presence of the Ancient of Days and presented before him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Then the Ancient of Days conferred upon him dominion, glory, and kingship. People of every nation and language group worshiped him. His dominion is everlasting and will never pass away, and his kingdom will never be destroyed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">As for me, Daniel, I was terrified by these night visions, and my spirit was deeply disturbed by all that I saw.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">I went up to one who was standing there and asked him to explain the true meaning of what I had witnessed. So he gave me the interpretation:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">&amp;apos;These four great beasts represent four empires that will rise to power over the earth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">But after them, the holy ones, the most high ones, will receive the kingdom and possess it forever. Yes , forever and ever!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">But I was curious to know more about the fourth beast. It was much different from all the others&amp;ndash;the terrifying, dreadful beast. It crushed its victims with claws of bronze and with teeth of iron and then trampled on them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Also, I wanted to know more about the ten horns on its head and the more prominent horn that sprouted up and uprooted three of the previous horns. I wanted to gain insight about this conspicuous little horn, more imposing than the others, with eyes in it and a mouth speaking arrogantly.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">As I watched, that horn fought against the holy ones and was defeating them</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">until the Everlasting One came on the scene. He handed judgment over to the saints of the Most High, and dominion was given to the holy ones of the Most High. Then the time came when the holy ones took possession of the kingdom.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">He gave me the interpretation: &amp;apos;The fourth beast means that there will be a fourth kingdom on the earth, different from all the other kingdoms. It will devour the whole earth, trample it down, and shatter it to pieces.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">And the ten horns are ten kings that will arise from that fourth kingdom, and they will succeed each other . But after them, an eleventh king will rise to power. He will be different from the previous ones and will subdue three of those kings.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">He will speak blasphemous words against the Most High and try to wear down the holy ones of the Most High. He will try to alter the set periods of time and change God&amp;quot;s decree, and the saints will be subjected to his power for a time, times, and half a time.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">But when the heavenly court convenes, his ruling power will be stripped from him . His authority will be abolished and destroyed forever.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">Then the Most High will give to his holy ones the kingdom and the dominion and the grandeur of all the kingdoms on earth. All rulers and authorities will serve and obey him, for his kingdom is everlasting.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">That is all that I saw in my dream. I, Daniel, was so greatly terrified by my thoughts that my face turned pale, but I hid the vision in my heart.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="8">
			<VERS vnumber="1">In the third year of the reign of King Belshazzar, I, Daniel, saw a second supernatural vision.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">In my vision I suddenly found myself in the fortress city of Susa, the capital of the province of Elam, standing beside the Ulai canal.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">As I looked about, behold, I saw a ram standing on the bank of the canal. It had two long horns, one behind the other, but the one behind was longer.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">I watched as the ram charged toward the west, then the north, and then the south. With each conquest, it became even more powerful. No beast could withstand it or be rescued from its power; it did whatever it pleased.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">As I considered what it all meant, I saw a male goat come rushing from the west, racing across the whole earth without touching the ground. He had a single prominent horn on his forehead.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">The goat came up to the two-horned ram that I saw standing beside the canal and rushed at it with savage force.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Then I saw him reach the ram and attack it with furious blows. He smashed it so hard that it broke off its two horns, for the ram had no power to withstand it. The goat knocked the ram to the ground and trampled it down. And there was no one to rescue the ram from his power.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Then the goat grew exceedingly arrogant. At the very peak of his power, his big horn abruptly snapped off. In its place, four prominent horns came up, each pointing to a different direction.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">From one of them, a small horn emerged. It eventually grew to be very big, and its power extended toward the south, the east, and toward the beautiful land .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">It grew so powerful that it attacked the armies of heaven and hurled some of the starry host to the ground and trampled them down.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">The horn arrogantly exalted itself against the Prince of the heavenly armies. It abolished the daily sacrifices, and the place of his sanctuary was defiled.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">God&amp;quot;s people began to turn away from him and gave themselves to the power of the horn. Sin replaced the daily sacrifices on account of the rebellion of the people. The horn was successful in all it attempted to do; truth was cast down to the ground.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Then I heard a holy one speaking. Another holy one asked the first one, the Wonderful Numberer, &amp;apos;How long will it be until this vision is fulfilled , in relation to the daily sacrifice, the rebellion that causes desolation, the handing over of the sanctuary, and the trampling underfoot of the host of God&amp;quot;s people ?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">He answered, &amp;apos;For 2,300 evenings and mornings; then the sanctuary will be purified.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">While I, Daniel, was pondering the vision I had seen, suddenly there appeared before me one who looked like a man.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Then I heard the voice of someone calling out over the waters of the Ulai canal, &amp;apos;Gabriel, help this man understand the meaning of his vision.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">As the angel Gabriel came closer to where I was standing, I was so terrified that I fell facedown on the ground. Then he said to me, &amp;apos; Daniel , son of man, you need to understand that your vision refers to the time of the end.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">When he spoke with me, I lost consciousness and passed out. But he took hold of me and raised me to my feet.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">&amp;apos;Listen,&amp;apos; he said, &amp;apos;and I will tell you what will take place in the time of wrath, for the vision pertains to the appointed time of the end:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">&amp;apos;The ram that you saw with two long horns represents the kingdoms of the Medes and the Persians.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">&amp;apos;The male goat represents the kingdoms of Greece, and the big horn on its forehead is the first king of the Greek Empire.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">&amp;apos;As for the horn that was broken off and replaced by four prominent horns, this signifies that four other kingdoms will rise from its midst, but their combined power will not be as great as the first.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">&amp;apos;When their reign comes to an end and their crimes have reached their full measure, there will arise a stern king, skilled in stubbornness and trickery.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">He will grow in might but not through any power of his own. He will cause amazing devastation, succeed in every undertaking, and destroy mighty ones, the saints of the Most High .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">By his cunning, he will make treachery succeed under his rule. In his own mind, he will highly exaggerate his own importance. When they are at ease, he will suddenly destroy many. But when he rises up against the Prince of all princes, he will be broken&amp;ndash;but not by any human power.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">&amp;apos;The explanation of the vision you had about the evening and morning sacrifices is absolutely true. And seal up the vision, for it concerns the distant future.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">I, Daniel, was dazed and lay sick for several days; then I got up and went back to serve the king. I was perplexed by the vision, for it seemed beyond understanding.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="9">
			<VERS vnumber="1">These things happened during the first year Darius son of Xerxes was king over Babylon. He was a descendant of the Medes.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">During his first year of rule, I, Daniel, was studying the Scriptures and noticed that according to the word Yahweh had revealed to the prophet Jeremiah, seventy years must pass while Jerusalem lay in ruins.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Then I turned my heart to the Lord God, seeking an answer from him, pleading for mercy with fasting, wearing sackcloth, and sitting among ashes.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">I prayed to Yahweh , my God, and made this confession: &amp;apos;My Lord, you are the great and awesome God who faithfully keeps your covenant of love with those who love you and keep your commands.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Yet we have sinned, acted wickedly, and done evil; we have rebelled and turned aside from your laws and commands.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">We have not listened to your servants the prophets, who prophesied in your name to our kings, our leaders, our fathers, and all the people of the land.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Righteousness belongs to you, Lord, but we are all covered with shame even to this day&amp;ndash;the people of Judah, the residents of Jerusalem, and all Israel, near and far. You have scattered us to many lands because of our treachery against you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Yes, Yahweh , we are all clothed with shame&amp;ndash;our kings, our princes, and our fathers, because we have sinned against you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">In spite of all that, Lord, our God, you are filled with compassion and overflow with forgiveness, even though we have openly rebelled against you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">&amp;apos; Yahweh , we have not listened to your voice, our God, nor kept your instructions that you gave us through your servants the prophets.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">All the people of Israel have ignored your voice; we have defied your instructions and gone astray. Now, the solemn curses confirmed by your promises of punishment in the law of your servant Moses have been poured out upon us because we sinned against you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">You have fulfilled the words that you spoke against us and against the rulers over us by bringing upon us such a great calamity. Your severe punishment of Jerusalem has never been equaled under all heaven!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">As the law of Moses warns, this calamity came upon us in full measure. And even now, Yahweh , we have not sought to please you, our God, by turning away from our wickedness and following your ways of truth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Yahweh , you have waited for the right moment to unleash this calamity upon us. Yahweh , our God, you are just and right in all that you have done, for we defiantly ignored your voice.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">&amp;apos;And now, Lord our God, you delivered your people out of the land of Egypt with mighty power. You have won fame and gained renown for yourself even to this day. But we acknowledge our sin and wicked ways.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Lord, you have always demonstrated your faithfulness to Israel, so now please turn your fierce anger away from Jerusalem. It belongs to you and sits on the hill where sacrifice is made. All the other nations who live around us despise your city and your people because of the sins of our ancestors and because of our sins also.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">And now, our God, I am your servant and I beg you, please&amp;ndash;answer my prayers. Make your face to shine upon your ruined temple so that everyone will know that you are Lord.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Turn your heart to hear my prayer, O my God. Listen to my cry and please look carefully and see our despair and the devastated city, which bears your name. We bring our requests to you and ask for your mercy, not because we deserve it but because of your extravagant, infinite love.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Lord, hear us and forgive us. Lord, please be attentive and act for us! Do not delay in answering us for your own sake, my God, and for your city and your people who bear your name.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">While I was absorbed in prayer, confessing my sins and the sins of my people Israel and presenting my request before Yahweh , my God, on behalf of Jerusalem , his holy hill&amp;ndash;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Gabriel, whom I had seen in a vision previously, came flying down from heaven. He touched me at the time of the evening sacrifice.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">He gave me understanding and said to me, &amp;apos;Daniel, I have come from heaven to impart insight and understanding concerning this prophecy .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">As soon as you began to pray, God gave you an answer, for you are a precious treasure to God ! Now, carefully consider the message and understand the revelation of the vision.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">&amp;apos;God has decreed for your people and for the holy city a period of seventy times seven for these reasons: to finish transgression, to put an end to sin, to cancel guilt, to bring in everlasting righteousness, to confirm the prophetic vision, and to anoint the Most Holy One.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">&amp;apos; You must know and understand this: From the issuing of God&amp;quot;s decree to restore and rebuild Jerusalem until the Anointed Ruler comes, there will be seven &amp;quot;sevens,&amp;quot; and sixty-two &amp;quot;sevens.&amp;quot; Jerusalem will be rebuilt with broad streets and a trench, but during times of great distress.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">&amp;apos;After those sixty-two weeks, the Anointed One will be cut off and left with nothing. The people of the commander will destroy both the city and the sanctuary. Then its end will come like an overwhelming flood, and until those sixty-two weeks end, there will be war. The decree of desolation has been issued!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">&amp;apos;For one week he will confirm a covenant with many people , but in the middle of that week, he will abolish sacrifices and offerings. &amp;apos;On the wing of the temple , an appalling abomination will be erected. And the abomination will remain there until God does away with the one who placed it there, just as God has determined.&amp;apos;</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="10">
			<VERS vnumber="1">In the third year of Cyrus king of Persia, I , Daniel, known as Belteshazzar, received a profound word&amp;ndash;a true revelation, but I struggled to understand it. Finally, its interpretation was disclosed to me in a vision, and I began to understand the word.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">At that time, I was in a period of mourning for three weeks.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">During the entire three weeks, I ate no delicacies &amp;ndash;no meat and no sweets. I drank no wine, nor did I groom myself.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">On the twenty-fourth day of the first month, I had a vision while I was standing on the bank of the great Tigris River.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">I opened my eyes to look about me, and I saw a man approaching who was robed in white linen and wearing a belt of pure gold.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">His body was like a glowing gemstone, his face shining as bright as lightning. His eyes were blazing like fiery torches; his arms and legs were gleaming like polished bronze; and the sound of his voice was thunderous, like the roar of a multitude.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Although others were present, I was the only one who experienced this open vision. Yet, it was so real that it terrified those who were with me, and they ran away to hide.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">I found myself alone, gazing on this astounding vision; I was left stunned and powerless. My appearance was altered beyond recognition, and what little strength I had deserted me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">As soon as the angel began to speak to me, I fell unconscious with my face to the ground, as in a coma.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Then I felt a powerful hand grip me and help me to my hands and knees. I was trembling with fear !</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">He said, &amp;apos;Daniel, you are greatly loved and a precious treasure to God. Now, stand up and understand the words that I am about to say, for God has sent me to you.&amp;apos; So, I rose to my feet, still shaking like a leaf .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">He reassured me by saying, &amp;apos;Daniel, don&amp;quot;t be afraid, for I have come to bring to you the answer to your prayer. From the first day you sought to understand the revelation and humbled yourself before God, your words were heard in heaven .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">However, for the past twenty-one days, the principality over the kingdom of Persia stood to oppose and resist me. Then Michael, one of the chief princes of heaven , came to my assistance. I was left there, confronting the king of Persia.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Now I have come to help you comprehend what will happen to your people in the final days, for the vision pertains to a time still to come.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Upon hearing these words, I bowed facedown and was left speechless.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Then suddenly, one who looked like a man touched my lips, and I was finally able to speak. So, I said to the one standing in front of me, &amp;apos;My lord, this vision has left me overcome, undone, and overwhelmed. I feel totally weak and helpless.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">My lord, how can I, your servant, even talk to you? I have no strength, and I can barely catch my breath!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Once again, the one who looked like a man gripped me and imparted strength to me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">He said to me, &amp;apos;Be strong! Be very, very strong! Do not be afraid, for you are greatly loved and a precious treasure to God. God&amp;quot;s peace is yours.&amp;apos; As he spoke those words, I felt strength pour into me, and I said, &amp;apos;Now, I&amp;quot;m ready to listen to you, my lord, for you have given me strength.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">I will unveil to you what is written in the Book of Truth: but first, I want you to know that there is none who fights alongside me against these forces of darkness except Michael, your people&amp;quot;s prince.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="11">
			<VERS vnumber="1">In the first year that Darius the Mede was king, I stood up to support Michael and fought with him against the prince of Persia.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">&amp;apos;I will now reveal the truth to you: Three more kings will rise to power in Persia; a fourth will come who will be much richer than all the others. His great wealth will cause his power to grow until his empire wages war against all the kingdoms of Greece.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Then a warrior-king will arise who will govern a vast empire and do whatever he pleases.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">But at the zenith of his power, his empire will be shattered and scattered to the four winds of heaven, though not to his descendants. It will not be as powerful as when he ruled it, for his dominion will be uprooted and will be passed on to others who are not his descendants .&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">&amp;apos;The king of Egypt will grow powerful, but one of his commanders will rise to become even more powerful and rule a kingdom greater than his.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Then, after some years have passed, an alliance will form. And in order to ensure the peace, the daughter of the king of Egypt will marry the king of Syria. However, her grip on power will not last for long, and the king, too, will lose his throne. In those days, she, her husband, her child, and those who escorted her to Syria will all be killed. Yet later,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">one of her family members will rise to become the king of Egypt. He will come against the defenses of the walled city of the king of Syria and defeat the Syrian armies.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">He will plunder their wealth and take it back to Egypt as spoils &amp;ndash;all their precious gold, silver vessels, idols, and statues. For some time, he will leave the kingdom of Syria in peace.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Eventually, the king of Syria will invade the kingdom of Egypt, but he will have to retreat to his own country.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">The king&amp;quot;s sons will prepare for war, assembling a powerful group of warriors. One of his sons will swiftly advance, sweeping over the land like a powerful flood. Their armies will press forward and fight all the way to the strong, walled fortress of the king of Egypt.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">&amp;apos;Then the king of Egypt will fly into a rage and set out to launch an offensive against the king of Syria, who will have an immense army on his side. However, the king of Egypt will conquer the Syrian forces.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">The king of Egypt will be filled with pride over his victory and of the many tens of thousands of soldiers he slaughtered, but he will not continue to be victorious.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">&amp;apos;Then the king of Syria will recruit an even larger army than before, and after some years, he will advance a second time with a massive army, fully equipped with weapons and supplies .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">&amp;apos;At that time, many will take up arms against the king of Egypt. Renegades from among your own people will rebel in the hope of realizing the vision; but they will fail.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Then the king of Syria will advance and build up siege-ramps to capture a strongly fortified city. The Egyptian forces will not stand their ground; even their elite troops will not be strong enough to resist.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">The invading king of Syria will do as he pleases, and no one will be able to resist him. He will occupy the land of splendor, and all of it will be under his control.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">&amp;apos;Then, with the might of his entire kingdom, he will resolve to conquer Egypt by cunningly making a peace treaty with the king of Egypt. The king of Syria will offer one of his daughters in marriage to the king of Egypt in order to defeat his kingdom, but his plan will fall apart and will not work to his advantage.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">The king of Syria will next turn to the coastlands and capture many cities, but a foreign commander will put a stop to his arrogance and make him suffer the consequences of his defiant insolence.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">&amp;apos;He will then retreat to the well protected fortresses of his own country. In time, he will be defeated, lose his grip on power, and disappear.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">His successor will send out a tax collector to maintain the wealth of his kingdom. In a short time, however, the king will die, though not in the heat of battle.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">The man in white linen continued : &amp;apos;In his place will rise a despised usurper of the throne, who had no claim to royal status. He will attack the kingdom when the people least suspect it, and he will seize the kingdom through deceit.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">He will totally sweep away every opposing army that stands before him and crush them. He will even kill the high priest of the covenant.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">And after he forms an alliance with him, he will act deceitfully and, despite his initial small following, he will grow ever stronger.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">Then unexpectedly, he will, by stealth, invade rich, fertile provinces and achieve what none of his ancestors did. And he will distribute the spoils and lavish them upon his followers. He will plot to defeat opposing forces protected in fortified positions and will succeed, but only for a short time.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">&amp;apos;He will stir up his might and courage, muster a large army, and wage war against the king of Egypt. However, the king of Egypt will fight back with an even greater army&amp;ndash;a massive and powerful army&amp;ndash;but he will be defeated because of secret plans devised against him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">His closest advisers, who eat at the king&amp;quot;s table, will attempt to kill him. His army will be swept away, and many will fall in the slaughter.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">&amp;apos;These two kings will sit at the same table and exchange lies with their hearts filled with evil motives. But their plans will come to nothing, for the time set by God has still not yet come.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="29">In the time God has appointed, he will go back to attack Egypt again, but this time the outcome will not be as before.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">Roman ships will oppose him, and he will lose heart. He will retreat and take out his indignation against the holy covenant and show favor to those who forsake that holy covenant.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">&amp;apos;He will then dispatch his armed forces to enter and profane the sacred temple-stronghold. They will abolish the daily sacrifice and, in its place, set the blasphemous abomination that brings desolation.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="33">&amp;apos;These who are filled with wisdom will help many understand what is happening. However, for a season, they will face severe testing. Some will go into captivity, some will be robbed, and some will be killed by the sword and by the flames.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">During this persecution, God&amp;quot;s people will receive little help, though many will join with them insincerely.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="36">&amp;apos;The king will grow more and more arrogant and do whatever he pleases. He will exalt himself above every other god, and utter horrendous blasphemies against the God of all gods. He will be successful until God&amp;quot;s wrath reaches the boiling point, for what God has decreed will certainly be fulfilled.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">The king will not respect the gods of his ancestors, the god worshiped by women, nor any other god because he will consider himself the greatest god of all.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="39">That king, with the help of his foreign god, will defend his own fortresses. He will give great honor to those who accept him as ruler, and elevate them as high officials and parcel out the land to them as their reward for their loyalty .&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">&amp;apos;At the time of the end, the king of Egypt will lock horns with the king of Syria, but the king of Syria will come storming out against him like a whirlwind&amp;ndash;with chariots, cavalry, and a great fleet of ships. He will pass through countries, overrun them, and sweep through them like a flood.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">He will even invade the glorious land, and many countries will fall, but Edom, Moab, and what remains of the Ammonites will escape.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">&amp;apos;He will use his power to attack many countries, and Egypt will not escape his onslaught.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43">He will confiscate all the Egyptian treasures, including its silver and gold. Libyans and Ethiopians will be in submission to him.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="8">I heard his answer, but it was like a riddle to me. So, I asked him, &amp;apos;Sir, how will all of this transpire?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">&amp;apos;You may go in peace, Daniel,&amp;apos; he replied. &amp;apos;The understanding of this message is to remain secret and sealed until the time of the end.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1">This is the scroll of the genealogy of Jesus, the Anointed One, the son of David and descendant of Abraham.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Abraham had a son named Isaac, who had a son named Jacob, who had a son named Judah (he and his brothers became the tribes of Israel) .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Judah and Tamar had twin sons, Perez and Zerah. Perez had a son named Hezron, who had a son named Ram,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">who had a son named Amminadab, who had a son named Nashon,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">who had a son named Salmon, who, along with Rahab, had a son named Boaz. Boaz and Ruth had a son named Obed, who was the father of Jesse,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">and Jesse had a son named David, who became the king .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Then David and Bathsheba had a son named Solomon, who had a son named Rehoboam, who had a son named Abijah, who had a son named Asa,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">who had a son named Jehoshaphat, who had a son named Joram, who had a son named Uzziah,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">who had a son named Jotham, who had a son named Ahaz, who had a son named Hezekiah,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">who had a son named Manasseh, who had a son named Amos, who had a son named Josiah,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">who was the father of Jeconiah. It was during the days of Jeconiah and his brothers that Israel was taken captive and deported to Babylon. she will give birth to a Son, and he will be known as &amp;apos;Emmanuel,&amp;apos; which means in Hebrew,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">About the time of their captivity in Babylon, Jeconiah had a son named Shealtiel, who had a son named Zerubbabel,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">who had a son named Abiud, who had a son named Eliakim,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">who had a son named Azor, who had a son named Zadok, who had a son named Achim, who had a son named Eliud,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">who had a son named Eleazar, who had a son named Matthan, who had a son named Jacob,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">who was the father of Joseph, the husband of Mary the mother of Jesus, who is called &amp;apos;the Anointed One.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">So from Abraham to David were fourteen generations, and from David to the Babylonian captivity, fourteen generations, and from the Babylonian captivity to Christ, fourteen generations.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">This is how the birth of Jesus Christ took place. His mother, Mary, had promised Joseph to be his wife, but while she was still a virgin she became pregnant through the power of the Holy Spirit. &amp;apos;God became one of us.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Her fiancÃ©, Joseph, was a righteous man full of integrity and he didn&amp;quot;t want to disgrace her, but when he learned of her pregnancy he secretly planned to break the engagement.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">While he was still debating with himself about what to do, he fell asleep and had a supernatural dream. An angel from the Lord appeared to him and said, &amp;apos;Joseph, descendant of David, don&amp;quot;t hesitate to take Mary into your home as your wife, because the power of the Holy Spirit has conceived a child in her womb.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">She will give birth to a son and you are to name him &amp;quot;Savior,&amp;quot; for he is destined to give his life to save his people from their sins.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">This happened to fulfill what the Lord had spoken through his prophet:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">Listen! A virgin will be pregnant,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">When Joseph woke from his dream, he did all that the angel of the Lord instructed him to do. He took Mary to be his wife,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">but they refrained from having sex until she gave birth to her firstborn son, whom they named &amp;apos;Jesus.&amp;apos;</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="2">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Jesus was born in Bethlehem near Jerusalem during the reign of King Herod. After Jesus&amp;quot; birth a group of spiritual priests from the East came to Jerusalem</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">and inquired of the people, &amp;apos;Where is the child who is born king of the Jewish people? We observed his star rising in the sky and we&amp;quot;ve come to bow before him in worship.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">King Herod was shaken to the core when he heard this, and not only he, but all of Jerusalem was disturbed when they heard this news.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">So he called a meeting of the Jewish ruling priests and religious scholars, demanding that they tell him where the promised Messiah was prophesied to be born.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">&amp;apos;He will be born in Bethlehem, in the land of Judah,&amp;apos; they told him. &amp;apos;Because the prophecy states:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">And you, little Bethlehem, are not insignificant among the clans of Judah, for out of you will emerge weeping, and wailing in Ramah. And she refuses to be comforted, the Shepherd-King of my people Israel!&amp;apos; I summon my Son out of Egypt. Rachel is weeping uncontrollably for her children. because they are dead and gone.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Then Herod secretly summoned the spiritual priests from the East to ascertain the exact time the star first appeared.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">And he told them, &amp;apos;Now go to Bethlehem and carefully look there for the child, and when you&amp;quot;ve found him, report to me so that I can go and bow down and worship him too.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">And on their way to Bethlehem, the same star they had seen in the East suddenly reappeared! Amazed, they watched as it went ahead of them and stopped directly over the place where the child was.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">And when they saw the star, they were so ecstatic that they shouted and celebrated with unrestrained joy.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">When they came into the house and saw the young child with Mary, his mother, they fell to the ground at his feet and worshiped him. Then they opened their treasure chests full of gifts and presented him with gold, frankincense, and myrrh.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Afterward they returned to their own country by another route because God had warned them in a dream not to go back to Herod.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">After they had gone, Joseph had another dream. An angel of the Lord appeared to him and said, &amp;apos;Get up now and flee to Egypt. Take Mary and the little child and stay there until I tell you to leave, for Herod intends to search for the child to kill him.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">So that very night he got up and took Jesus and his mother and made their escape to Egypt</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">and remained there until Herod died. All of this fulfilled what the Lord had spoken through his prophet:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">When Herod realized that he had been tricked by the wise men, he was infuriated. So he sent soldiers with orders to slaughter every baby boy two years old and younger in Bethlehem and throughout the surrounding countryside, based on the time frame he was given from interrogating the wise men.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">This fulfilled the words of the prophet Jeremiah:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">I hear the screams of anguish,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">After Herod died, an angel of the Lord appeared again to Joseph in a dream while he was still in Egypt,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">saying, &amp;apos;Go back to the land of Israel and take the child and his mother with you, for those who sought to kill the child are dead.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">So he awoke and took Jesus and Mary and returned to the land of Israel.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">But when he heard that Archelaus, Herod&amp;quot;s son, had succeeded him as ruler over all of the territory of Judah, he was afraid to go back. Then he had another dream from God, warning him to avoid that region and instructing him instead to go to the province of Galilee.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">So he settled his family in the village of Nazareth, fulfilling the prophecy that he would be known as the &amp;apos;Branch.&amp;apos;</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="3">
			<VERS vnumber="1">It was at this time that John the Baptizer began to preach in the desert of Judah. His message was this:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">&amp;apos;Heaven&amp;quot;s kingdom is about to appear&amp;ndash;so you&amp;quot;d better keep turning away from evil and turn back to God!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Isaiah was referring to John when he prophesied: A thunderous voice! One will be crying out in the wilderness, &amp;apos;Prepare yourself for the Lord&amp;quot;s coming and level a straight path inside your hearts for him.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Now, John wore clothing made from camel&amp;quot;s hair, tied at his waist with a leather strap, and his food consisted of dried locusts and wild honey.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">A steady stream of people from Jerusalem, all the surrounding countryside, and the region near the Jordan came out to the wilderness to be baptized by him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">And while they were publicly confessing their sins, he would immerse them in the Jordan River.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">But when he saw many coming from among the wealthy elite of Jewish society and many of the religious leaders known as Pharisees coming to witness the baptism, he began to denounce them, saying, &amp;apos;You offspring of vipers! Who warned you to slither away like snakes from the fire of God&amp;quot;s judgment ?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">You must prove your repentance by a changed life.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">And don&amp;quot;t presume you can get away with merely saying to yourselves, &amp;quot;But we&amp;quot;re Abraham&amp;quot;s descendants!&amp;quot; For I tell you, God can awaken these stones to become sons of Abraham!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">The axe is now ready to cut down the trees at their very roots. Every fruitless, rotten tree will be chopped down and thrown into the fire.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Those who repent I baptize with water, but there is coming a man after me who is more powerful than I. In fact, I&amp;quot;m not even worthy enough to pick up his sandals. He will submerge you into union with the Spirit of Holiness and with a raging fire!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">He comes with a winnowing fork in his hands and comes to his threshing floor to sift what is worthless from what is pure. And he is ready to sweep out his threshing floor and gather his wheat into his granary, but the straw he will burn up with a fire that can&amp;quot;t be extinguished!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Then Jesus left Galilee to come to the Jordan to be baptized by John.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">But when he waded into the water, John resisted him, saying, &amp;apos;Why are you doing this? I&amp;quot;m the one who needs to be baptized by you, and yet you come to be baptized by me?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Jesus replied, &amp;apos;It is only right to do all that God requires.&amp;apos; Then John baptized Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">And as Jesus rose up out of the water, the heavenly realm opened up over him and he saw the Holy Spirit descend out of the heavens and rest upon him in the form of a dove.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Then suddenly the voice of the Father shouted from the sky, saying, &amp;apos;This is my Son&amp;ndash;the Beloved! My greatest delight is in him.&amp;apos;</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="4">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Afterward, the Holy Spirit led Jesus into the wilderness to experience the ordeal of testing by the accuser.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">And after fasting for forty days, Jesus was extremely hungry.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Then the tempter came to him and said, &amp;apos;How can you possibly be the Son of God and go hungry? Just command these stones to be turned into loaves of bread.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">He answered, &amp;apos;The Scriptures say: Bread alone will not satisfy, that constantly goes forth from God&amp;quot;s mouth.&amp;apos; so that you won&amp;quot;t even bruise your foot on a rock.&amp;apos; You must never put the Lord your God to a test.&amp;apos; and worship only him.&amp;apos; can now say, &amp;apos;We have seen a brilliant Light.&amp;apos; but true life is found in every word He will command his angels to protect you and they will lift you up Kneel before the Lord your God and the land of Naphtali, along the road to the sea and on the other side of the Jordan, and Galilee&amp;ndash;the land of the Gentiles! And those who live in the dark shadow land of death can now say, &amp;apos;The Dawning Light arises on us.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Then the accuser transported Jesus to the holy city of Jerusalem and perched him at the highest point of the temple</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">and said to him, &amp;apos;If you&amp;quot;re really God&amp;quot;s Son, jump, and the angels will catch you. For it is written in the Scriptures:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Once again Jesus said to him, &amp;apos;The Scriptures say:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">And the third time the accuser lifted Jesus up onto a very high mountain range and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and all the splendor that goes with it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">&amp;apos;All of these kingdoms I will give to you,&amp;apos; the accuser said, &amp;apos;if only you will kneel down before me and worship me.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">But Jesus said, &amp;apos;Go away, Satan! For the Scriptures say:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">At once the accuser left him, and angels suddenly gathered around Jesus to minister to his needs.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">When Jesus heard that John the Baptizer had been thrown into prison, he went back into Galilee.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Jesus moved from Nazareth to make his home in Capernaum, which is by Lake Galilee in the land of Zebulun and Naphtali.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">He did this to make the prophecy of Isaiah come true:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Listen, you who live in the land of Zebulun</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">You who spend your days shrouded in darkness</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">From that time on Jesus began to proclaim his message with these words: &amp;apos;Keep turning away from your sins and come back to God, for heaven&amp;quot;s kingdom realm is now accessible.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">As he was walking by the shore of Lake Galilee, Jesus noticed two fishermen who were brothers. One was nicknamed Keefa (later called Peter), and the other was Andrew, his brother. Watching as they were casting their nets into the water,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Jesus called out to them and said, &amp;apos;Come and follow me, and I will transform you into men who catch people for God.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Immediately they dropped their nets and left everything behind to follow Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Leaving there, Jesus found three other men sitting in a boat, mending their nets. Two were brothers, Jacob and John, and they were with their father, Zebedee. Jesus called Jacob and John to his side and said to them , &amp;apos;Come and follow me.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">And at once they left their boat and their father, and began to follow Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">Jesus ministered from place to place throughout all of the province of Galilee. He taught in the synagogues, preaching the wonderful news of the kingdom and healing every kind of sickness and disease among the people.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">His fame spread throughout all Syria! Many people who were in pain and suffering with every kind of illness were brought to Jesus for their healing&amp;ndash;epileptics, paralytics, and those tormented by demonic powers were all set free. Everyone who was brought to Jesus was healed!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">This resulted in massive crowds of people following him, including people from Galilee, Jerusalem, the land of Judah, the region of the Ten Cities known as the Decapolis, and beyond the Jordan River.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="5">
			<VERS vnumber="1">One day Jesus saw a vast crowd of people gathering to hear him, so he went up the slope of a hill and sat down. With his followers and disciples spread over the hillside,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Jesus began to teach them:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">&amp;apos;What happiness comes to you when you feel your spiritual poverty! For yours is the realm of heaven&amp;quot;s kingdom.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">&amp;apos;What delight comes to you when you wait upon the Lord! For you will find what you long for.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">&amp;apos;What blessing comes to you when gentleness lives in you! For you will inherit the earth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">&amp;apos;How enriched you are when you crave righteousness! For you will be satisfied.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">&amp;apos;How blessed you are when you demonstrate tender mercy! For tender mercy will be demonstrated to you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">&amp;apos;What bliss you experience when your heart is pure! For then your eyes will open to see more and more of God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">&amp;apos;How joyful you are when you make peace! For then you will be recognized as a true child of God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">&amp;apos;How enriched you are when persecuted for doing what is right! For then you experience the realm of heaven&amp;quot;s kingdom.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">&amp;apos;How blessed you are when people insult and persecute you and speak all kinds of cruel lies about you because of your love for me!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">So leap for joy&amp;ndash;since your heavenly reward is great. For you are being rejected the same way the prophets were before you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">&amp;apos;Your lives are like salt among the people. But if you, like salt, become bland, how can your &amp;quot;saltiness&amp;quot; be restored? Flavorless salt is good for nothing and will be thrown out and trampled on by others.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">&amp;apos;Your lives light up the world. For how can you hide a city that stands on a hilltop?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">And who would light a lamp and then hide it in an obscure place? Instead, it&amp;quot;s placed where everyone in the house can benefit from its light.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">So don&amp;quot;t hide your light! Let it shine brightly before others, so that your commendable works will shine as light upon them, and then they will give their praise to your Father in heaven.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">&amp;apos;If you think I&amp;quot;ve come to set aside the law of Moses or the writings of the prophets, you&amp;quot;re mistaken. I have come to bring to perfection all that has been written.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Indeed, I assure you, as long as heaven and earth endure, not even the smallest detail of the Law will be done away with until its purpose is complete.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">So whoever violates even the least important of the commandments, and teaches others to do so, will be called least in heaven&amp;quot;s kingdom. But whoever obeys them and teaches their truths to others will be called great in heaven&amp;quot;s kingdom.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">For I tell you, unless your lives are more pure and full of integrity than the religious scholars and the Pharisees, you will never enter heaven&amp;quot;s kingdom.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">&amp;apos;You&amp;quot;re familiar with the commandment taught to those of old: &amp;quot;Do not murder or you will be judged.&amp;quot;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">But I&amp;quot;m telling you, if you hold anger in your heart toward a fellow believer, you are subject to judgment. And whoever demeans and insults a fellow believer is answerable to the congregation. And whoever calls down curses upon a fellow believer is in danger of being sent to a fiery hell.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">&amp;apos;So then, if you are presenting a gift before the altar and suddenly you remember a quarrel you have with a fellow believer,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">leave your gift there in front of the altar and go at once to apologize to the one who is offended. Then, after you have reconciled, come to the altar and present your gift.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">It is always better to come to terms with the one who wants to sue you before you go to trial, or you may be found guilty by the judge, and he will hand you over to the officers, who will throw you into prison.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">Believe me, you won&amp;quot;t get out of prison until you have paid the full amount!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">&amp;apos;Your ancestors have been taught, &amp;quot;Never commit adultery.&amp;quot;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">However, I say to you, if you look with lust in your eyes at a woman who is not your wife, you&amp;quot;ve already committed adultery in your heart.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">If your right eye seduces you to fall into sin, then go blind in your right eye! For you&amp;quot;re better off losing sight in one eye than to have your whole body thrown into hell.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">And if your right hand entices you to sin, let it go limp and useless! For you&amp;quot;re better off losing a part of your body than to have it all thrown into hell.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">&amp;apos;It has been said, &amp;quot;Whoever divorces his wife must give her legal divorce papers.&amp;quot;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">However, I say to you, if anyone divorces his wife for any reason, except for infidelity, he causes her to commit adultery, and whoever marries a divorced woman commits adultery.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">&amp;apos;Again, your ancestors were taught, &amp;quot;Never swear an oath that you don&amp;quot;t intend to keep, but keep your vows to the Lord God.&amp;quot;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">However, I say to you, don&amp;quot;t bind yourself by taking an oath at all. Don&amp;quot;t swear by heaven, for heaven is where God&amp;quot;s throne is placed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">Don&amp;quot;t swear an oath by the earth, because it is the rug under God&amp;quot;s feet, and not by Jerusalem, because it is the city of the Great King.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">And why would you swear by your own head, because it&amp;quot;s not in your power to turn a single hair white or black? But just let your words ring true.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">A simple &amp;quot;Yes&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;No&amp;quot; will suffice. Anything beyond this springs from a deceiver.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">&amp;apos;Your ancestors have also been taught, &amp;quot;Take an eye in exchange for an eye and a tooth in exchange for a tooth.&amp;quot;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">However, I say to you, don&amp;quot;t repay an evil act with another evil act. But whoever insults you by slapping you on the right cheek, turn the other to him as well.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">If someone is determined to sue you for your coat, give him the shirt off your back as a gift in return.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">And should people in authority take advantage of you, do more than what they demand.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">Learn to generously share what you have with those who ask for help, and don&amp;quot;t close your heart to the one who comes to borrow from you.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43">&amp;apos;Your ancestors have also been taught &amp;quot;Love your neighbors and hate the one who hates you.&amp;quot;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44">However, I say to you, love your enemy, bless the one who curses you, do something wonderful for the one who hates you, and respond to the very ones who persecute you by praying for them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45">For that will reveal your identity as children of your heavenly Father. He is kind to all by bringing the sunrise to warm and rainfall to refresh whether a person does what is good or evil.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46">What reward do you deserve if you only love the loveable? Don&amp;quot;t even the tax collectors do that?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="47">How are you any different from others if you limit your kindness only to your friends? Don&amp;quot;t even the ungodly do that?</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="25">&amp;apos;This is why I tell you to never be worried about your life, for all that you need will be provided, such as food, water, clothing&amp;ndash;everything your body needs. Isn&amp;quot;t there more to your life than a meal? Isn&amp;quot;t your body more than clothing?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">&amp;apos;Consider the birds&amp;ndash;do you think they worry about their existence? They don&amp;quot;t plant or reap or store up food, yet your heavenly Father provides them each with food. Aren&amp;quot;t you much more valuable to your Father than they?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">So, which one of you by worrying could add anything to your life?</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="30">So if God has clothed the meadow with hay, which is here for such a short time and then dried up and burned, won&amp;quot;t he provide for you the clothes you need&amp;ndash;you of little faith?</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="8">
			<VERS vnumber="1">After he came down from teaching on the hillside, massive crowds began following him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Suddenly, a leper walked up to Jesus and threw himself down before him in worship and said, &amp;apos;Lord, you have the power to heal me . . . if you really want to.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Jesus reached out his hand and touched the leper and said, &amp;apos;Of course I want to heal you&amp;ndash;be healed!&amp;apos; And instantly, all signs of leprosy disappeared!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Then Jesus said to him, &amp;apos;Don&amp;quot;t speak to anyone, but go at once and find a priest and show him what has happened to you. Make sure to take the offering Moses commanded so he can certify your healing.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">When Jesus entered the village of Capernaum, a captain in the Roman army approached him, asking for a miracle.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">&amp;apos;Lord,&amp;apos; he said, &amp;apos;I have a son who is lying in my home, paralyzed and suffering terribly.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Jesus responded, &amp;apos;I will go with you and heal him.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Jesus was astonished when he heard this and said to those who were following him, &amp;apos;He has greater faith than anyone I&amp;quot;ve encountered in Israel!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Listen to what I am about to tell you. Multitudes of Gentiles will stream from the east and the west, to enter into the heavenly kingdom with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">But many Israelites, born to be heirs of the kingdom, will be turned away and banished into the darkness where there will be bitter weeping and unbearable anguish.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Then Jesus turned to the Roman officer and said, &amp;apos;Go home. All that you have believed for will be done for you!&amp;apos; And his son was healed at that very moment.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Then Jesus entered Peter&amp;quot;s home and found Peter&amp;quot;s mother-in-law bedridden, severely ill with a fever.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">The moment Jesus touched her hand she was healed! Immediately she got up and began to make dinner for them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">That evening the people brought to him many who were demonized. And by Jesus only speaking a word of healing over them, they were totally set free from their torment, and everyone who was sick received their healing!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">In doing this, Jesus fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah: He put upon himself our weaknesses, and he carried away our diseases and made us well.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">At the sight of large crowds gathering around him, Jesus gave orders to his disciples to get ready to sail back over to the other side of the lake.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Just then, a religious scholar approached him and said, &amp;apos;Teacher, I&amp;quot;ll follow you wherever you go!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Jesus replied, &amp;apos;Foxes have dens, birds have nests, but the Son of Man has no true home in this world.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Then another man spoke up and said, &amp;apos;Lord, I&amp;quot;ll follow you, but first I must take care of my aged father and bury him when he dies.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">But Jesus said to him, &amp;apos;Now is the time to follow me, and let those who are dead bury their own dead.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">They all got into a boat and began to cross over to the other side of the lake. And Jesus, exhausted, fell asleep .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">Suddenly a violent storm developed, with waves so high the boat was about to be swamped. Yet Jesus continued to sleep soundly.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">The disciples woke him up, saying, &amp;apos;Save us, Lord! We&amp;quot;re going to die!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">But Jesus reprimanded them. &amp;apos;Why are you gripped with fear? Where is your faith?&amp;apos; Then he stood and rebuked the storm, saying, &amp;apos;Be still!&amp;apos; And instantly it became perfectly calm.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">The disciples were astonished by this miracle and said to one another, &amp;apos;Who is this Man? Even the wind and waves obey his Word.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">When they arrived on the other side of the lake, in the region of the Gadarenes, two demonized men confronted Jesus. They lived among the tombs of a cemetery and were considered so extremely violent that no one felt safe passing through that area.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">The demons screamed at Jesus, shouting, &amp;apos;Son of God, what do you want with us? Leave us alone! Have you come to torment us before the appointed time?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">There was a large herd of pigs feeding nearby.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">And the demons pleaded, &amp;apos;If you cast us out, send us into that herd of pigs.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">Jesus commanded, &amp;apos;Then go!&amp;apos; And at once the demons came out of the men and went into the pigs. Then the entire herd of crazed pigs stampeded down the steep slope and fell into the water and drowned.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">The men who were herding the pigs fled to the nearby town and informed the people of all that had happened to the demonized men.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">Then everyone from the town went out to confront Jesus and urged him to go away and leave them alone.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="9">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Jesus got into the boat and returned to what was considered his hometown, Capernaum .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Just then some people brought a paraplegic man to him, lying on a sleeping mat. When Jesus perceived the strong faith within their hearts, he said to the paralyzed man, &amp;apos;My son, be encouraged, for your sins have been forgiven.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">These words prompted some of the religious scholars to think, &amp;apos;Why, that&amp;quot;s nothing but blasphemy!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Jesus supernaturally perceived their thoughts, and said to them, &amp;apos;Why do you carry such evil in your hearts?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Which is easier to say, &amp;quot;Your sins are forgiven,&amp;quot; or, &amp;quot;Stand up and walk!&amp;quot;?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">But now, to convince you that the Son of Man has been given authority to forgive sins, I say to this man, &amp;quot;Stand up, pick up your mat, and walk home.&amp;quot; &amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Immediately the man sprang to his feet and left for home.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">When the crowds witnessed this miracle, they were awestruck. They shouted praises to God because he had given such authority to human beings.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">As Jesus left Capernaum he came upon a tax-collecting station, where a Jewish man named Matthew was collecting taxes for the Romans. &amp;apos;Come, follow me,&amp;apos; Jesus said to him. Immediately Matthew jumped up and began to follow Jesus. They replied, &amp;apos;Yes Lord, we believe!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Jesus went to Matthew&amp;quot;s house and made himself at home. Many other tax collectors and outcasts of society were invited to eat with Jesus and his disciples.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">When those known as the Pharisees saw what was happening, they were indignant, and they kept asking Jesus&amp;quot; disciples, &amp;apos;Why would your Master dine with such lowlifes?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">When Jesus overheard this, he spoke up and said, &amp;apos;Healthy people don&amp;quot;t need to see a doctor, but the sick will go for treatment.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Then he added, &amp;apos;Now you should go and study the meaning of the verse: I want you to show mercy, not just offer me a sacrifice. For I have come to invite the outcasts of society and sinners, not those who think they are already on the right path.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">The disciples of John the Baptizer approached Jesus with this question: &amp;apos;Why is it that we and the Pharisees fast regularly, but not your disciples?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Jesus replied, &amp;apos;How can the sons of the bridal chamber grieve when the Bridegroom is next to them? But the days of fasting will come when the Bridegroom is taken away from them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">And who would mend worn-out clothing with new fabric? When the new cloth shrinks it will rip, making the hole worse than before.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">And who would pour fresh, new wine into an old wineskin? Eventually the wine will ferment and make the wineskin burst, losing everything&amp;ndash;the wine is spilled and the wineskin ruined. Instead, new wine is always poured into a new wineskin so that both are preserved.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">While Jesus was still speaking, an influential Jewish leader approached and knelt before him, saying, &amp;apos;Help me! My daughter has just died. Please come and place your hand upon her so that she will live again.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">So Jesus and his disciples got up and went with him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Suddenly, a woman came from behind Jesus and touched the tassel of his prayer shawl for healing . She had been suffering from continual bleeding for twelve years, but had faith that Jesus could heal her .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">For she kept saying to herself, &amp;apos;If I could only touch his prayer shawl I would be healed.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Just then Jesus turned around and looked at her and said, &amp;apos;My daughter, be encouraged. Your faith has healed you.&amp;apos; And instantly she was healed!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">When Jesus finally entered the home of the Jewish leader, he saw a noisy crowd of mourners, wailing and playing a funeral dirge on their flutes.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">He told them, &amp;apos;You must leave, for the little girl is not dead; she&amp;quot;s only asleep.&amp;apos; Then everyone began to ridicule him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">After he made the crowd go outside, he went into the girl&amp;quot;s room and gently took hold of her hand. She immediately stood to her feet!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">And the news of this incredible miracle spread everywhere.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">As Jesus left the house, two blind men began following him, shouting out over and over, &amp;apos;Son of David, show us mercy and heal us!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">And they followed him right into the house where Jesus was staying. So Jesus asked them, &amp;apos;Do you believe that I have the power to restore sight to your eyes?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">Then Jesus put his hands over their eyes and said, &amp;apos;You will have what your faith expects!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">And instantly their eyes opened&amp;ndash;they could see! Then Jesus warned them sternly, &amp;apos;Make sure that you tell no one what just happened!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">But unable to contain themselves, they went out and spread the news everywhere!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">While they were leaving, some people brought before Jesus a demonized man who couldn&amp;quot;t speak.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">Jesus cast the demon out of him, and immediately the man began to speak plainly . The crowds marveled in astonishment, saying, &amp;apos;We&amp;quot;ve never seen miracles like this in Israel!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">But the Pharisees kept saying, &amp;apos;The chief of demons is helping him drive out demons.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">Jesus walked throughout the region with the joyful message of God&amp;quot;s kingdom realm. He taught in their meeting houses, and wherever he went he demonstrated God&amp;quot;s power by healing every kind of disease and illness.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">When he saw the vast crowds of people, Jesus&amp;quot; heart was deeply moved with compassion, because they seemed weary and helpless, like wandering sheep without a shepherd.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">He turned to his disciples and said, &amp;apos;The harvest is huge and ripe! But there are not enough harvesters to bring it all in.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">As you go, plead with the Owner of the Harvest to thrust out many more reapers to harvest his grain!&amp;apos;</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="10">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Jesus gathered his twelve disciples and imparted to them authority to cast out demons and to heal every sickness and every disease.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="6">Go instead and find the lost sheep among the people of Israel.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">And as you go, preach this message: &amp;quot;Heaven&amp;quot;s kingdom realm is accessible, close enough to touch.&amp;quot;</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="11">
			<VERS vnumber="1">After Jesus finished giving instructions to his twelve disciples, he went on to minister in different villages throughout the region.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Now, while John the Baptizer was in prison, he heard about the wonderful deeds of the Christ, so he sent his disciples to ask him this question:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">&amp;apos;Are you really the one the prophets said would come, or should we still wait for another?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Jesus answered them, &amp;apos;Give John this report:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">&amp;quot;The blind see again, the crippled walk, lepers are cured, the deaf hear, the dead are raised back to life, and the poor and broken now hear of the hope of salvation!&amp;quot;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">And tell John that the blessing of heaven comes to those who are not offended over me.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">As they were leaving, Jesus began to speak to the crowd about John. &amp;apos;What kind of man did you see when you went out into the wilderness? Did you expect to see a man who would be easily intimidated?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Who was he? Did you expect to see a man decked out in the splendid fashion of the day? Those who wear fancy clothes live like kings in palaces.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Or did you encounter a true prophet out in the lonely wilderness? Yes, John was a prophet like those of the past, but he is even more than that!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">He was the fulfillment of this Scripture: See, I am sending my prophetic messenger and prepare hearts to receive me. who will go ahead of me</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">&amp;apos;For I tell you the truth, throughout history there has never been a man who surpasses John the Baptizer. Yet the least of those who now experience heaven&amp;quot;s kingdom will become even greater than he.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">From the moment John stepped onto the scene until now, the realm of heaven&amp;quot;s kingdom is bursting forth, and passionate people have taken hold of its power.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">For all the prophets and the Torah prophesied until John appeared.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">If you can receive this truth, John is the Elijah who was destined to come.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">So listen and understand what I&amp;quot;m telling you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">&amp;apos;How could I describe the people of this generation? You&amp;quot;re like children playing games on the playground, yelling at their playmates,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">&amp;quot;You don&amp;quot;t like it when we want to play Wedding! And you don&amp;quot;t like it when we want to play Funeral! You will neither dance nor mourn.&amp;quot;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Why is it that when John came to you, neither feasting nor drinking wine, you said, &amp;quot;He has a demon in him!&amp;quot;?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Yet when the Son of Man came and went to feasts and drank wine, you said, &amp;quot;Look at this man! He is nothing but a glutton and a drunkard! He spends all his time with tax collectors and other sinners.&amp;quot; But God&amp;quot;s wisdom will become visible by those who embrace it.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Then Jesus began to openly denounce the cities where he had done most of his mighty miracles, because the people failed to turn away from sin and return to God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">He said, &amp;apos;How tragic it will be for the city of Korazin! And how horrible for the city of Bethsaida! For if the powerful miracles that I performed in Korazin and Bethsaida had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have humbled themselves and repented, and turned from their sins.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Tyre and Sidon will be better off on judgment day than you!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">And Capernaum&amp;ndash;do you really think you&amp;quot;ll be exalted because of the great miracles I have done there? No! You&amp;quot;ll be brought down to the depths of hell because of your rejection of me. For if the miracles I worked in your streets were done in Sodom, it would still be standing today!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">But I tell you, it will be more bearable for the region of Sodom in the day of judgment than it will be for you.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">Then Jesus exclaimed, &amp;apos;Father, thank you, for you are Lord, the Supreme Ruler over heaven and earth! And you have hidden the great revelation of your authority from those who are proud and think they are wise and unveiled it instead to little children.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">Yes, Father, you&amp;quot;ve chosen this gracious plan to extend your kingdom.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">You have entrusted me with all that you are and all that you have. No one fully and intimately knows the Son except the Father. And no one fully and intimately knows the Father except the Son. But the Son is able to unveil the Father to anyone he chooses.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">&amp;apos;Are you weary, carrying a heavy burden? Come to me. I will refresh your life, for I am your oasis.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">Simply join your life with mine. Learn my ways and you&amp;quot;ll discover that I&amp;quot;m gentle, humble, easy to please. You will find refreshment and rest in me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">For all that I require of you will be pleasant and easy to bear.&amp;apos;</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="12">
			<VERS vnumber="1">One Saturday, on the day of rest, Jesus and his disciples were walking through a field of wheat. The disciples were hungry, so they plucked off some heads of grain and rubbed them in their hands to eat.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">But when some of the Pharisees saw what was happening, they said to him, &amp;apos;Look! Your disciples shouldn&amp;quot;t be harvesting grain on the Sabbath!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Jesus responded, &amp;apos;Haven&amp;quot;t you ever read what King David and his men did when they were hungry?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">They entered the house of God and ate the sacred bread of God&amp;quot;s presence, violating the law by eating bread that only the priests were allowed to eat.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">&amp;apos;And haven&amp;quot;t you read in the Torah that the priests violated the rules of the Sabbath by carrying out their duties in the temple on a Saturday, and yet they are without blame?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">But I say to you, there is one here who is even greater than the temple.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">If only you could learn the meaning of the words &amp;quot;I want compassion more than a sacrifice,&amp;quot; you wouldn&amp;quot;t be condemning my innocent disciples.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">For the Son of Man exercises his lordship over the Sabbath.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Then Jesus left them and went into the synagogue where</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">he encountered a man who had an atrophied, paralyzed hand. The fault-finding Pharisees asked Jesus, &amp;apos;Is it permissible to perform a work of healing on the Sabbath?&amp;apos; They only asked him this question because they hoped to accuse him of breaking the Jewish laws.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">He answered them, &amp;apos;If any of you had a lamb that fell into a ditch on the Sabbath, wouldn&amp;quot;t you reach out your hand and lift it out?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Isn&amp;quot;t a man much more valuable than a lamb? So of course, it&amp;quot;s always proper to do miracles, even on the Sabbath.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Then he turned to the man and said, &amp;apos;Hold out your hand!&amp;apos; And as he stretched it out, it was restored, exactly like the other.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Immediately the Pharisees went out and started to scheme about how they would destroy him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Jesus knew what they were thinking, so he left by another way. Massive crowds followed him from there, and he healed all who were sick.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">However, he sternly warned them not to tell others or disclose his real identity,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">in order to fulfill the prophecy of Isaiah:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Take a careful look at my servant, my chosen one. I love him dearly I will breathe my Spirit upon him until his victory releases justice. &amp;apos;Any kingdom that fights against itself is reduced to ruins. And any family or community splintered by strife will fall apart. and I find all my delight in him. and he will decree justice to the nations. He will be gentle with the weak and feeble, will birth hope among the people.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">He will not quarrel or raise his voice in public.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">He won&amp;quot;t brush aside the bruised and broken.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">And the fame of his name</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Then a man was brought before Jesus who had a demon spirit that made him both blind and mute. Jesus healed him instantly, and he could see and talk again!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">The crowds went wild with amazement as they witnessed this miracle. And they kept saying to one another, &amp;apos;Could this man be the Messiah?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">But when the Pharisees overheard what the people were saying, they said, &amp;apos;He casts out demons by the power of Satan, the prince of demons!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">Jesus supernaturally perceived their thoughts and motives, so he told them this parable:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">So if Satan casts out Satan, he is making war on himself. How then could his kingdom stand?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">So if Satan empowers me to cast out demons, who empowers your exorcists to cast them out? Go ask them, let them be your judges.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">But, if I drive out demons by the power of the Spirit of God, then the end of Satan&amp;quot;s kingdom has come!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">Who would dare enter the house of a mighty man and steal his property? First he must be overpowered and tied up by one who is stronger than he. Then his entire house can be plundered.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">&amp;apos; So join with me, for if you&amp;quot;re not on my side you are against me. And if you refuse to help me gather the spoils, you are making things worse.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">This is why I warn you. God will forgive people for every sin and blasphemy except one. There is no forgiveness for the sin of blasphemy against the Holy Spirit.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">If anyone speaks evil of me, the Son of Man, he can be forgiven; but if anyone speaks against the Holy Spirit, it will never be forgiven, now or ever!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">&amp;apos;You must determine if a tree is good or rotten. You can recognize good trees by their delicious fruit. But if you find rotten fruit, you can be certain that the tree is rotten. The fruit defines the tree.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">But you who are known as the Pharisees are rotten to the core like venomous snakes. How can your words be good if you are rotten within? For what has been stored up in your hearts will be heard in the overflow of your words!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">&amp;apos;When virtue is stored within, the hearts of good, upright people will produce good fruit. But when evil is hidden within, those who are evil will produce evil fruit.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">You can be sure of this: when the day of judgment comes, everyone will be held accountable for every careless word he has spoken.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">Your very words will be used as evidence, and your words will declare you either innocent or guilty.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">Then a few Jewish scholars and Pharisees spoke up and said, &amp;apos;Teacher, why don&amp;quot;t you perform a miraculous sign for us.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">Jesus replied, &amp;apos;Only evil people who are unfaithful to God would demand a sign. There will be no sign given to you except the sign of the prophet Jonah.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">For as Jonah was in the belly of the huge sea creature for three days and three nights, so the Son of Man will be in the heart of the earth for three days and three nights.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">The people of Nineveh will also rise up on the day of judgment to condemn this generation. For they all repented when they heard the preaching of Jonah. And there is one greater than Jonah here preaching to you today !</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">Even the Queen of Sheba will rise up on the day of judgment to condemn this generation for its unbelief! She journeyed from a far and distant land just to hear the wisdom of King Solomon. Yet now there is one greater than Solomon speaking to you today.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43">&amp;apos;When a demon is cast out of a person, it roams around a dry region, looking for a place to rest, but never finds it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44">Then it says, &amp;quot;I&amp;quot;ll return to the house I moved out of,&amp;quot; and so it goes back, only to find that the house is vacant, warm, and ready for it to move back in.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45">So it goes looking for seven other demons more evil than itself, and they all enter together to live there. Then the person&amp;quot;s condition becomes much worse than it was in the beginning. This describes what will also happen to the people of this evil generation.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46">While Jesus was still speaking to the crowds, his mother and brothers came and stood outside, asking for him to come out and speak with them .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="47">Then someone said, &amp;apos;Look, your mother and brothers are standing outside, wanting to have a word with you.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="48">But Jesus just looked at him and said, &amp;apos;Let me introduce you to my true mother and brothers.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="49">Then gesturing to the disciples gathered around him , he said, &amp;apos;Look closely, for this is my true family.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="50">When you obey my heavenly Father, that makes you a part of my true family.&amp;apos;</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="13">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Later that day, Jesus left the house and sat by the lakeshore to teach the people .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Soon, there were so many people surrounding him that he had to teach sitting in a boat while the large crowd stood on the shore.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">He taught them many things by using stories, parables to illustrate spiritual truths, saying: &amp;apos;Consider this: There was a farmer who went out to sow seeds . and I would instantly heal them. &amp;apos;Heaven&amp;quot;s kingdom can be compared to yeast that a woman takes and blends into three measures of flour and then waits until all the dough rises.&amp;apos; since before the foundation of the world. &amp;apos;A person discovered that there was hidden treasure in a field. Upon finding it, he hid it again. Because of uncovering such treasure, he was overjoyed and sold all that he possessed to buy the entire field just so he could have the treasure.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">As he cast his seeds , some fell along the beaten path and the birds came and ate them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Others fell onto gravel that had no topsoil. They quickly shot up,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">but when the days grew hot, they were scorched and withered because they had insufficient roots.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Others fell among the thorns, so when they sprouted, the thorns choked them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">But other seeds fell on good, rich soil that kept producing a good harvest. Some yielded thirty, some sixty, and some even one hundred times as much as he planted!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">If you&amp;quot;re able to understand this, then you need to respond.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Then his disciples approached Jesus and asked, &amp;apos;Why do you always speak to people in these hard-to-understand parables?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">He explained, &amp;apos;You&amp;quot;ve been given the intimate experience of insight into the hidden mysteries of the realm of heaven&amp;quot;s kingdom, but they have not.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">For everyone who listens with an open heart will receive progressively more revelation until he has more than enough. But those who don&amp;quot;t listen with an open, teachable heart, even the understanding that they think they have will be taken from them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">That&amp;quot;s why I teach the people using parables, because they think they&amp;quot;re looking for truth, yet because their hearts are unteachable, they never discover it. Although they will listen to me, they never fully perceive the message I speak.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">The prophecy of Isaiah describes them perfectly: Although they listen carefully to everything I speak, they don&amp;quot;t understand a thing I say. They look and pretend to see, but the eyes of their hearts are closed. their ears are plugged and are hard of hearing, and they have deliberately shut their eyes to the truth. Otherwise they would open their eyes to see, and open their ears to hear, and open their minds to understand. Then they would turn to me &amp;apos;Heaven&amp;quot;s kingdom can be compared to a farmer who planted good seed in his field. &amp;apos;They replied, &amp;quot;Do you want us to go and gather up all the weeds?&amp;quot; &amp;apos;Heaven&amp;quot;s kingdom can be compared to the tiny mustard seed that a man takes and plants in his field. I will speak to you in allegories. I will reveal secrets that have been concealed &amp;apos;Yes,&amp;apos; they replied. Jesus said, &amp;apos;There&amp;quot;s only one place a prophet isn&amp;quot;t honored&amp;ndash;his own hometown!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Their minds are dull and slow to perceive,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">&amp;apos;But blissful are your eyes, for they see. Delighted are your ears, for they are open to hear all these things.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Many prophets and godly people yearned to see these days of miracles that you&amp;quot;ve been favored to see. They would have given everything to hear the revelation you&amp;quot;ve been favored to hear.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">&amp;apos;Now you are ready to hear the explanation of the parable of the sower:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">&amp;apos;What was sown along the path represents the one who listens to the message of the kingdom but doesn&amp;quot;t understand it. The Adversary then comes and snatches away what was sown into his heart.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">&amp;apos;The one sown on gravel represents the person who gladly hears the kingdom message, but his experience remains shallow.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Shortly after he hears it, troubles and persecutions come because of the kingdom message he received. Then he quickly falls away, for the truth didn&amp;quot;t sink deeply into his heart.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">&amp;apos;The one sown among thorns represents one who receives the message, but all of life&amp;quot;s busy distractions, his divided heart, and his ambition for wealth result in suffocating the kingdom message and it becomes fruitless.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">&amp;apos;But what was sown on good, rich soil represents the one who hears and fully embraces the message of the kingdom. Their lives bear good fruit&amp;ndash;some yield a harvest of thirty, sixty, even one hundred times as much as was sown.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">Then Jesus taught them another parable:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">But when everyone was asleep, an enemy came and planted weeds among the wheat and ran away.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">When the wheat sprouted and bore grain, the weeds also appeared.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">So the farmer&amp;quot;s hired hands came to him and said, &amp;quot;Sir, wasn&amp;quot;t that good seed that you sowed in the field? Where did all these weeds come from?&amp;quot;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">&amp;apos;He answered, &amp;quot;This has to be the work of an enemy!&amp;quot;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">&amp;apos; &amp;quot;No,&amp;quot; he said. &amp;quot;If you pull out the weeds you might uproot the wheat at the same time.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">Let them both grow together until the harvest. At that time, I&amp;quot;ll tell my harvesters to gather the weeds first and tie them all in bundles to be burned. Then they will harvest the wheat and put it into my barn.&amp;quot; &amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">Then Jesus taught them another parable:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">Although the smallest of all the seeds, it eventually grows into the greatest of garden plants, becoming a tree for birds to come and build their nests in its branches.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">Then he taught them another parable:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">Whenever Jesus addressed the crowds, he always spoke in allegories. He never spoke without using parables.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">He did this to fulfill the prophecy:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">Jesus left the crowds and went inside the house where he was staying . Then his disciples approached him and asked, &amp;apos;Please explain the deeper meaning of the parable of the weeds growing in the field of wheat.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">He answered, &amp;apos;The man who sowed his field with good seed is the Son of Man.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">And the field is the world. The good seeds I sow are the children of the kingdom realm. The weeds are the children of the Evil One,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">and the enemy who sows them is the devil. The harvest points to the end of this age, and the harvesters are God&amp;quot;s messengers.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">As the weeds are bundled up and thrown into the fire, so it will be at the close of the age.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">The Son of Man will send his messengers, and they will uproot everything out of his kingdom. All the lawless ones and everything that causes sin will be removed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">And they will throw them into the fiery furnace, where they will experience great sorrow and anguish.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43">Then the righteous will shine like the brightness of the sun in their Father&amp;quot;s kingdom realm. If you&amp;quot;re able to understand this, then you&amp;quot;d better respond!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44">&amp;apos;Heaven&amp;quot;s kingdom realm can be illustrated like this:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45">&amp;apos;Heaven&amp;quot;s kingdom realm is also like a jewel merchant in search of rare pearls.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46">When he discovered one very precious and exquisite pearl, he immediately gave up all he had in exchange for it.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="47">&amp;apos;Again, heaven&amp;quot;s kingdom realm is like a fisherman who casts his large net into the lake, catching an assortment of fish.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="48">When the net was filled, the fishermen hauled it up on the shore, and they all sat down to sort out their catch. They collected the good in baskets and threw the bad away.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="49">And so it will be at the close of the age. The messengers will come and separate the evil from among the godly</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="50">and throw them into the fiery furnace, where they will experience great sorrow and anguish.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="51">Now do you understand all this?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="52">He responded, &amp;apos;Every scholar of the Scriptures, who is instructed in the ways of heaven&amp;quot;s kingdom realm, is like a wealthy home owner with his house filled with treasures both new and old.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="53">Right after Jesus taught this series of parables, he left from there.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="54">When Jesus arrived in his hometown of Nazareth , he began teaching the people in the synagogue. Everyone was dazed, overwhelmed with astonishment over the depth of revelation they were hearing. They said to one another, &amp;apos;Where did this man get such great wisdom and miraculous powers?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="55">Isn&amp;quot;t he just the craftsman&amp;quot;s son? Isn&amp;quot;t his mother named Mary, and his four brothers Jacob, Joseph, Simon, and Judah?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="56">And don&amp;quot;t his sisters all live here in Nazareth? From where then did he get all this revelation and power?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="57">And the people became offended and began to turn against him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="58">And their unbelief kept him from doing many mighty miracles in Nazareth .</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="14">
			<VERS vnumber="1">At that time Herod, the Roman ruler over Galilee, heard reports about Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">He told his officials, &amp;apos;This man has to be John the Baptizer who has come back from the dead. That&amp;quot;s why he has this power to work miracles.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">For Herod had earlier arrested John for confronting him for taking the wife of his brother Philip. He had John thrown in prison and placed in chains</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">because John had repeatedly said to him, &amp;apos;It&amp;quot;s not legal or proper for you to be married to Herodias, your sister-in-law!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">So Herod wanted John dead, but he was afraid of the crowds who flocked to John because they considered him to be a prophet.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">During Herod&amp;quot;s birthday celebration, the daughter of Herodias danced before Herod and all his distinguished guests, which greatly pleased the king.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">So he said to her in front of them all, &amp;apos;I give you my oath, ask of me anything you wish and it will be yours!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Because she had been instructed by her mother, she said, &amp;apos;I want the head of John the Baptizer here on a platter!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">This grieved the king, but because of his oath in front of all of his guests,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">he had John beheaded in prison.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">They brought in his head and displayed it to her on a platter, and she then had it shown to her mother.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">John&amp;quot;s disciples went into the prison and carried his body away and buried it. Then they left to find Jesus and tell him what had happened.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">On hearing this, Jesus slipped away privately by boat to be alone. But when the crowds discovered he had sailed away, they emerged from all the nearby towns and followed him on foot.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">So when Jesus landed he had a huge crowd waiting for him. Seeing so many people, his heart was deeply moved with compassion toward them, so he healed all the sick who were in the crowd.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Later that afternoon the disciples came to Jesus and said, &amp;apos;It&amp;quot;s going to be dark soon and the people are hungry, but there&amp;quot;s nothing to eat here in this desolate place. You should send the crowds away to the nearby villages to buy themselves some food.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">&amp;apos;They don&amp;quot;t need to leave,&amp;apos; Jesus responded. &amp;apos;You can give them something to eat.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">They answered, &amp;apos;But all we have is five barley loaves and two fish.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">&amp;apos;Let me have them,&amp;apos; Jesus replied.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Then he had everyone sit down on the grass and he then took the five loaves and two fish. He looked up into heaven, gave thanks to God, and broke the bread into pieces. He then gave it to his disciples, who in turn gave it to the crowds.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">And everyone ate until they were satisfied, for the food was multiplied in front of their eyes ! They picked up the leftovers and filled up twelve baskets full!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">There were about five thousand men who were fed, in addition to many women and children!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">As soon as the people were fed, Jesus told his disciples to get into their boat and to go to the other side of the lake while he stayed behind to dismiss the people.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">After the crowds dispersed, Jesus went up into the hills to pray. And as night fell he was there praying alone.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">But the disciples, who were now in the middle of the lake, ran into trouble, for their boat was tossed about by the high winds and heavy seas.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">At about four o&amp;quot;clock in the morning, Jesus came to them, walking on the waves!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">When the disciples saw him walking on top of the water, they were terrified and screamed, &amp;apos;A ghost!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">Then Jesus said, &amp;apos;Be brave and don&amp;quot;t be afraid. I am here!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">Peter shouted out, &amp;apos;Lord, if it&amp;quot;s really you, then have me join you on the water!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">&amp;apos;Come and join me,&amp;apos; Jesus replied. So Peter stepped out onto the water and began to walk toward Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">But when he realized how high the waves were, he became frightened and started to sink. &amp;apos;Save me, Lord!&amp;apos; he cried out.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">Jesus immediately stretched out his hand and lifted him up and said, &amp;apos;What little faith you have! Why would you let doubt win?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">And the very moment they both stepped into the boat, the raging wind ceased.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">Then all the disciples bowed down before him and worshiped Jesus. They said in adoration, &amp;apos;You are truly the Son of God!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">After they crossed over and landed at Gennesaret,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">the people living there quickly recognized who he was. They were quick to spread the news throughout the surrounding region that Jesus had come to them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">So they brought him all their sick, begging him to let them touch the fringe of his cloak. And everyone who touched it was instantly healed!</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="15">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Then the Pharisees and religious scholars came from Jerusalem and asked Jesus this question:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">&amp;apos;Why do your disciples ignore the traditions of our elders? For example, they don&amp;quot;t ceremonially wash their hands before they eat bread.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Jesus answered, &amp;apos;And why do you ignore the commandment of God because of your traditions?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">For didn&amp;quot;t God say, &amp;quot;Honor your father and mother,&amp;quot; and, &amp;quot;Whoever abuses or insults his father or mother must be put to death?&amp;quot;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">&amp;apos;But you teach that it&amp;quot;s permissible to say to your parents when they are in financial need, &amp;quot;Whatever gift you would have received from me I can keep for myself, since I dedicated it as an offering to God.&amp;quot;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">This doesn&amp;quot;t honor your father or mother. And you have elevated your tradition above the words of God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Frauds and hypocrites! Isaiah described you perfectly when he said:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">These people honor me only with their words, for their hearts are so very distant from me. but their worship is nothing more &amp;apos;Seven,&amp;apos; they replied, &amp;apos;and a few small fish.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">They pretend to worship me, than the empty traditions of men.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Then Jesus turned to the crowd and said, &amp;apos;Come, listen and open your heart to understand.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">What truly contaminates a person is not what he puts into his mouth but what comes out of his mouth. That&amp;quot;s what makes people defiled.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Then his disciples approached him and said, &amp;apos;Don&amp;quot;t you know that what you just said offended the Pharisees?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Jesus replied, &amp;apos;Every plant that my heavenly Father didn&amp;quot;t plant is destined to be uprooted.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Stay away from them, for they&amp;quot;re nothing more than blind guides. Do you know what happens when a blind man pretends to guide another blind man? They both stumble into a ditch!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Peter spoke up and said, &amp;apos;Will you explain to us what you mean by your parable?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Jesus said, &amp;apos;Even after all that I&amp;quot;ve taught you, you still remain clueless?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Is it hard to understand that whatever you eat enters the stomach only to pass out into the sewer?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">But what comes out of your mouth reveals the core of your heart. Words can pollute, not food.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">You will find living within an impure heart evil ideas, murderous thoughts, adultery, sexual immorality, theft, lies, and slander.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">That&amp;quot;s what pollutes a person. Eating with unwashed hands doesn&amp;quot;t defile anyone.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Then Jesus left and went north into the non-Jewish region of Lebanon.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">He encountered there a Canaanite woman who shouted out to him, &amp;apos;Lord, Son of David, show mercy to me! My daughter is horribly afflicted by a demon that torments her.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">But Jesus never answered her. So his disciples said to him, &amp;apos;Why do you ignore this woman who is crying out to us?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">Jesus said, &amp;apos;I&amp;quot;ve only been sent to the lost sheep of Israel.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">But she came and bowed down before him and said, &amp;apos;Lord, help me!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">Jesus responded, &amp;apos;It&amp;quot;s not right for a man to take bread from his children and throw it out to the dogs.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">&amp;apos;You&amp;quot;re right, Lord,&amp;apos; she replied. &amp;apos;But even puppies get to eat the crumbs that fall from the prince&amp;quot;s table.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">Then Jesus answered her, &amp;apos;Dear woman, your faith is strong! What you desire will be done for you.&amp;apos; And at that very moment, her daughter was instantly set free from demonic torment.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">After leaving Lebanon, Jesus went to Lake Galilee and climbed a hill nearby and sat down.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">Then huge crowds of people streamed up the hill, bringing with them the lame, blind, deformed, mute, and many others in need of healing. They laid them at Jesus&amp;quot; feet and he healed them all.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">And the crowds marveled with amazement, astounded over the things they were witnessing with their own eyes! The lame were walking, the mute were speaking, the crippled were made well, and the blind could see. For three days everyone celebrated the miracles as they exalted and praised the God of Israel!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">Jesus called his disciples to himself and said, &amp;apos;I care deeply about all these people, for they&amp;quot;ve already been with me for three days without food. I don&amp;quot;t want to send them away fasting or else they may be overcome by weakness on their journey home.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">The disciples said to him, &amp;apos;Where in the world are we going to find enough food in this desolate place to feed this crowd?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">&amp;apos;How many barley loaves do you have?&amp;apos; Jesus asked.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">So he gave the order, &amp;apos;Have the people sit down on the grass.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">Then he took the seven loaves and the fish and gave thanks to God. He broke the bread and gave it to his disciples, who then distributed the food to the crowds.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">When everyone was full and satisfied, they gathered up the leftovers. And from what was once seven loaves and a few fish, they filled seven baskets!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">There were four thousand men who ate the food Jesus multiplied, and even more including the women and children!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">After dismissing the crowd, Jesus got into the boat and crossed over to the region of Magdala.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="16">
			<VERS vnumber="1">One day some of the Pharisees and those of the Jewish sect known as the Sadducees approached Jesus, insisting that he prove to them that he was the Messiah. &amp;apos;Show us a supernatural sign from heaven,&amp;apos; they demanded.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Jesus answered, &amp;apos;You can read the signs of the weather, for you say, &amp;quot;Red sky at night, sailors delight.&amp;quot;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">And, &amp;quot;Red sky in the morning, sailors take warning.&amp;quot; You&amp;quot;re so adept at forecasting the weather by looking at the sky, but you&amp;quot;re absolutely clueless in reading the obvious signs of the times.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">A wicked and wayward generation always asks for signs, but the only sign I provide for you will be the sign of Jonah the prophet.&amp;apos; Then he turned away and left them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Later, as Jesus and his disciples crossed over to the other side of Lake Galilee, the disciples realized they had forgotten to bring any loaves of bread.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Jesus spoke up and said, &amp;apos;Watch out for the yeast of the Pharisees and the Sadducees.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Thinking Jesus was scolding them over not bringing bread, they began to discuss it among themselves.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Knowing their thoughts, Jesus said to them, &amp;apos;You have such little faith! Why are you arguing with one another about having no bread?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Are you so slow to understand? Have you forgotten the miracle of feeding the five thousand families and how each of you ended up with a basket full of fragments?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">And how seven loaves of bread fed four thousand families with baskets left over?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Don&amp;quot;t you understand? I&amp;quot;m not talking about bread, but I&amp;quot;m warning you to avoid the yeast of the Pharisees and the Sadducees.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Then finally they realized he wasn&amp;quot;t talking about yeast found in bread, but the error of the teachings of the Pharisees and the Sadducees.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">When Jesus came to Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples this question: &amp;apos;What are the people saying about me, the Son of Man? Who do they believe I am?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">They answered, &amp;apos;Some are convinced you are John the Baptizer, others say you are Elijah reincarnated, or Jeremiah, or one of the prophets.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">&amp;apos;But you&amp;ndash;who do you say that I am?&amp;apos; Jesus asked.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Simon Peter spoke up and said, &amp;apos;You are the Anointed One, the Son of the living God!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Jesus replied, &amp;apos;You are favored and privileged Simeon, son of Jonah! For you didn&amp;quot;t discover this on your own, but my Father in heaven has supernaturally revealed it to you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">I give you the name Peter, a stone . And this rock will be the bedrock foundation on which I will build my church&amp;ndash; my legislative assembly , and the power of death will not be able to overpower it!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">I will give you the keys of heaven&amp;quot;s kingdom realm to forbid on earth that which is forbidden in heaven, and to release on earth that which is released in heaven.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">He then gave his disciples strict orders not to tell anyone that he was the Messiah.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">From then on Jesus began to clearly reveal to his disciples that he was destined to go to Jerusalem and suffer injustice from the elders, leading priests, and religious scholars. He also explained that he would be killed and three days later be raised to life again.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Peter took him aside to correct him privately. He reprimanded Jesus over and over, saying to him, &amp;apos;God forbid, Master! Spare yourself. You must never let this happen to you!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">Jesus turned to Peter and said, &amp;apos;Get out of my way, you Satan! You are a hindrance to me, because your thoughts are only filled with man&amp;quot;s viewpoints and not with the ways of God.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">Then Jesus said to his disciples, &amp;apos;If you truly want to follow me, you should at once completely reject and disown your own life. And you must be willing to share my cross and experience it as your own, as you continually surrender to my ways.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">For if you choose self-sacrifice and lose your lives for my glory, you will continually discover true life. But if you choose to keep your lives for yourselves, you will forfeit what you try to keep.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">For even if you were to gain all the wealth and power of this world&amp;ndash;at the cost of your own life&amp;ndash;what good would that be? And what could be more valuable to you than your own soul?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">I, the Son of Man, will one day return with my messengers and in the splendor and majesty of my Father. And then I will reward each person according to what they have done.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">But I promise you, there are some standing here now who won&amp;quot;t experience death until they have witnessed the coming of the Son of Man in the presence and the power of the kingdom realm of God!&amp;apos;</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="17">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Six days later Jesus took Peter and the two brothers, Jacob and John, and hiked up a high mountain to be alone.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Then Jesus&amp;quot; appearance was dramatically altered. A radiant light as bright as the sun poured from his face. And his clothing became luminescent&amp;ndash;dazzling like lightning. He was transfigured before their very eyes.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Then suddenly, Moses and Elijah appeared, and they spoke with Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Peter blurted out, &amp;apos;Lord, it&amp;quot;s so wonderful that we are all here together! If you want, I&amp;quot;ll construct three shrines, one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">But while Peter was still speaking, a bright radiant cloud spread over them, enveloping them all. And God&amp;quot;s voice suddenly spoke from the cloud, saying, &amp;apos;This is my dearly loved Son, the constant focus of my delight. Listen to him!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">The three disciples were dazed and terrified by this phenomenon, and they fell facedown to the ground.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">But Jesus walked over and touched them, saying, &amp;apos;Get up and stop being afraid.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">When they finally opened their eyes and looked around, they saw no one else there but Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">As they all hiked down the mountain together, Jesus ordered them, &amp;apos;Don&amp;quot;t tell anyone of the divine appearance you just witnessed. Wait until the Son of Man is raised from the dead.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">His disciples asked him, &amp;apos;Why do all the religious scholars insist that Elijah must first appear before the Anointed One comes?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">He answered them, &amp;apos;They&amp;quot;re right. Elijah must come first and restore all things.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">But Elijah has already appeared. And yet they didn&amp;quot;t recognize him, so they did to him whatever they pleased. And the Son of Man is destined to suffer the same abuse as what they did to him.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Then the disciples realized that Jesus was referring to John the Baptizer all along.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">They came to where a large crowd had gathered to wait for Jesus . A man came and knelt before him</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">and said, &amp;apos;Lord, please show your tender mercy toward my son. He has a demon who afflicts him . He has epilepsy, and he suffers horribly from seizures. He often falls into the cooking fire or into the river.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">I brought him to your followers, but they weren&amp;quot;t able to heal him.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Jesus replied, &amp;apos;Where is your faith? Can&amp;quot;t you see how wayward and wrong this generation is? How much longer do I stay with you and put up with your doubts? Bring your son to me.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Then Jesus rebuked the demon and it came out of him and the boy was instantly healed!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Later the disciples came to him privately and asked, &amp;apos;Why couldn&amp;quot;t we cast out the demon?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">He told them, &amp;apos;It was because of your lack of faith. I promise you, if you have faith inside of you no bigger than the size of a small mustard seed, you can say to this mountain, &amp;quot;Move away from here and go over there,&amp;quot; and you will see it move! There is nothing you couldn&amp;quot;t do!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">But this kind is cast out only through prayer and fasting.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">When they all gathered together in Galilee, Jesus said to them, &amp;apos;The Son of Man is going to be betrayed and turned over to his enemies.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">They will kill him and in three days he will be resurrected.&amp;apos; When the disciples heard these words they were devastated.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">After they arrived in Capernaum, the collectors of the temple tax approached Peter and asked, &amp;apos;Does your teacher pay the tax for the upkeep of the temple, like the rest of us?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">&amp;apos;Of course he does,&amp;apos; Peter answered. When Peter walked into the house, and before he had a chance to speak, Jesus spoke up and said, &amp;apos;Peter, I have a question for you. Who pays tolls or taxes to a king? Is tax collected from the king&amp;quot;s own children, or from his subjects?&amp;apos; Jesus replied, &amp;apos;That&amp;quot;s right. The children get off free without paying taxes.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">&amp;apos;From his subjects,&amp;apos; Peter answered.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">But so that we don&amp;quot;t offend them, go to the lake and throw out your hook, and the first fish that rises up will have a coin in its mouth. It will be the exact amount you need to pay the temple tax for both of us.&amp;apos;</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="18">
			<VERS vnumber="1">At that time the disciples came to ask Jesus, &amp;apos;Who is considered to be the greatest in heaven&amp;quot;s kingdom realm?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Jesus called a little one to his side and said to them,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">&amp;apos;Learn this well: Unless you dramatically change your way of thinking and become teachable like a little child , you will never be able to enter in.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Whoever continually humbles himself to become like this little child is the greatest one in heaven&amp;quot;s kingdom realm.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">And if you tenderly care for this little one on my behalf, you are tenderly caring for me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">But if anyone abuses one of these little ones who believes in me, it would be better for him to have a heavy boulder tied around his neck and be hurled into the deepest sea than to face the punishment he deserves!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">&amp;apos;Misery will come to the one who lures people away into sin. Troubles and obstacles to your faith are inevitable, but great devastation will come to the one guilty of causing others to stumble!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">If your hand clings to sin, cut it off and throw it away. If your foot continually steps onto sin&amp;quot;s path, cut it off and throw it away. For it is better for you to enter into heaven crippled and maimed than to have both hands and both feet and be thrown into the eternal fire.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">And if your eye is always focusing on sin, pluck it out and throw it away. For it is better for you to enter into heaven with one eye than to be thrown into hell fire with two.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">&amp;apos;Be careful that you not corrupt one of these little ones. For I can assure you that in heaven each of their guardian angels always sees the face of my heavenly Father.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">&amp;apos;The Son of Man has come to give life to all who are lost.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Think of it this way: If a man owns a hundred sheep and one lamb wanders away and is lost, won&amp;quot;t he leave the ninety-nine grazing the hillside and thoroughly search for the one lost lamb?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">And if he finds his lost lamb, he rejoices over it, more than over the ninety-nine that never went astray.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Now you should understand that it is never the desire of your heavenly Father that a single one of these little ones should be lost.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">&amp;apos;If your fellow believer sins against you, you must go to that one privately and attempt to resolve the matter. If he responds, your relationship is restored.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">But if his heart is closed to you, then go to him again, taking one or two others with you. You&amp;quot;ll be fulfilling what the Scripture teaches when it says, &amp;quot;Every word may be verified by the testimony of two or three witnesses.&amp;quot;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">And if he refuses to listen, then share the issue with the congregation in hopes of restoration . If he still refuses to respond, even to the church, then you must disregard him as though he were an outsider, on the same level as an unrepentant sinner.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">&amp;apos;Receive this truth: Whatever you forbid on earth will be considered to be forbidden in heaven, and whatever you release on earth will be considered to be released in heaven.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Again, I give you an eternal truth: If two of you agree to ask God for something in a symphony of prayer, my heavenly Father will do it for you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">For wherever two or three come together in honor of my name, I am right there with them!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Later Peter approached Jesus and said, &amp;apos;How many times do I have to forgive my fellow believer who keeps offending me? Seven times?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Jesus answered, &amp;apos;Not seven times, Peter, but seventy times seven times!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">The lessons of forgiveness in heaven&amp;quot;s kingdom realm can be illustrated like this: &amp;apos;There once was a king who had servants who had borrowed money from the royal treasury. He decided to settle accounts with each of them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">As he began the process, it came to his attention that one of his servants owed him one billion dollars. So he summoned the servant before him and said to him, &amp;quot;Pay me what you owe me.&amp;quot;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">When his servant was unable to repay his debt, the king ordered that he be sold as a slave along with his wife and children and every possession they owned as payment toward his debt.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">The servant threw himself facedown at his master&amp;quot;s feet and begged for mercy. &amp;quot;Please be patient with me. Just give me more time and I will repay you all that I owe.&amp;quot;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">Upon hearing his pleas, the king had compassion on his servant, and released him, and forgave his entire debt.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">&amp;apos;No sooner had the servant left when he met one of his fellow servants, who owed him twenty thousand dollars He seized him by the throat and began to choke him, saying, &amp;quot;You&amp;quot;d better pay me right now everything you owe me!&amp;quot;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">His fellow servant threw himself facedown at his feet and begged, &amp;quot;Please be patient with me. If you&amp;quot;ll just give me time, I will repay you all that is owed.&amp;quot;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">But the one who had his debt forgiven stubbornly refused to forgive what was owed him. He had his fellow servant thrown into prison and demanded he remain there until he repaid the debt in full.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">&amp;apos;When his associates saw what was going on, they were outraged and went to the king and told him the whole story.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">The king said to him, &amp;quot;You scoundrel! Is this the way you respond to my mercy? Because you begged me, I forgave you the massive debt that you owed me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">Why didn&amp;quot;t you show the same mercy to your fellow servant that I showed to you?&amp;quot;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">In a fury of anger, the king turned him over to the prison guards to be tortured until all his debt was repaid.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">In this same way, my heavenly Father will deal with any of you if you do not release forgiveness from your heart toward your fellow believer.&amp;apos;</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="19">
			<VERS vnumber="1">After Jesus finished teaching them, he left Galilee and made his way toward the district of Judea, east of the Jordan River.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Massive crowds followed him and he healed all who were sick.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">The Pharisees were intent on putting Jesus to the test with difficult questions, so they approached him and asked, &amp;apos;Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any reason?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">&amp;apos;Haven&amp;quot;t you read the Scriptures about creation?&amp;apos; Jesus replied. &amp;apos;The Creator made us male and female from the very beginning,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">and &amp;quot;For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and live with his wife. And the two will become one flesh.&amp;quot;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">From then on, they are no longer two, but united as one. So what God unites let no one divide!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">They responded, &amp;apos;So then why did Moses command us to give a certificate of divorce and it would be lawful?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Jesus said, &amp;apos;Moses permitted you to divorce because your hearts are so hard and stubborn, but originally there was no such thing.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">But I say to you, whoever leaves his wife for any reason other than immorality, then takes another wife is living in adultery. And whoever takes a divorced woman in marriage is also living in adultery.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">His disciples spoke up and said, &amp;apos;If this is the standard, then it seems better to never get married.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">&amp;apos;Not everyone is meant to remain single&amp;ndash;only those whom God gives grace to be unmarried.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">For some are born to celibacy; others have been made eunuchs by others. And there are some who have chosen to live in celibacy for the sacred purpose of heaven&amp;quot;s kingdom realm. Let those who can, accept this truth for themselves.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Then they brought little children to Jesus so that he would lay his hands on them, bless them, and pray for them. But the disciples scolded those who brought the children, saying, &amp;apos;Don&amp;quot;t bother him with this now!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Jesus overheard them and said, &amp;apos;I want little children to come to me, so never interfere with them when they want to come, for heaven&amp;quot;s kingdom realm is composed of beloved ones like these! Listen to this truth: No one will enter the kingdom realm of heaven unless he becomes like one of these!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Then he laid his hands on each of them and went on his way.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Then a young man approached Jesus and bowed before him, saying, &amp;apos;Wonderful teacher &amp;ndash;is there a good work I have to do to obtain eternal life?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Jesus answered, &amp;apos;Why would you call me wonderful? God alone is wonderful. And why would you ask what good work you need to do? Keep the commandments and you&amp;quot;ll enter into the life of God.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">&amp;apos;Which ones?&amp;apos; he asked. Jesus said, &amp;apos;Don&amp;quot;t murder, don&amp;quot;t commit adultery, don&amp;quot;t steal, don&amp;quot;t lie,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">honor your father and mother, and love those around you as you love yourself.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">&amp;apos;But I&amp;quot;ve always obeyed every one of them without fail,&amp;apos; the young man replied. &amp;apos;What else do I lack?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Jesus said to him, &amp;apos;If you really want to be perfect, go now and sell everything you own. Give your money to the poor and your treasure will be transferred into heaven. Then come back and follow me for the rest of your life.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">When the young man heard these words, he walked away sad, for he had great wealth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">Then Jesus turned to his disciples and said, &amp;apos;Listen. Do you understand how difficult it is for the rich to enter into heaven&amp;quot;s kingdom realm?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">In fact, it&amp;quot;s easier to stuff a heavy rope through the eye of a needle than it is for the wealthy to enter into God&amp;quot;s kingdom realm!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">Stunned and bewildered, his disciples asked, &amp;apos;Then who in the world can possibly be saved?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">Looking into their eyes, Jesus replied, &amp;apos;Humanly speaking, no one, because no one can save himself . But what seems impossible to you is never impossible to God!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">Then Peter blurted out, &amp;apos;Here we are. We&amp;quot;ve given up everything to follow you. What reward will there be for us?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">Jesus responded, &amp;apos;Listen to the truth: In the age of the restoration of all things, when the Son of Man sits on his glorious throne, you who have followed me will have twelve thrones of your own, and you will govern the twelve tribes of Israel.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">For anyone who has left behind their home and property, leaving family&amp;ndash;brothers or sisters, mothers or fathers, or children&amp;ndash;for my sake, they will be repaid a hundred times over and will inherit eternal life.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">But many who push themselves to be first will find themselves last. And those who are willing to be last will find themselves to be first.&amp;apos;</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="20">
			<VERS vnumber="1">&amp;apos;This will help you understand the way heaven&amp;quot;s kingdom operates: &amp;apos;There once was a wealthy landowner who went out at daybreak to hire all the laborers he could find to work in his vineyard. &amp;apos;So he said to them, &amp;quot;Then go and join my crew and work in my vineyard.&amp;quot;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">After agreeing to pay them the standard day&amp;quot;s wage, he put them to work.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Then at nine o&amp;quot;clock, as he was passing through the town square, he found others standing around without work.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">He told them, &amp;quot;Come and work for me in my vineyard and I&amp;quot;ll pay you a fair wage.&amp;quot;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">So off they went to join the others. He did the same thing at noon and again at three o&amp;quot;clock, making the same arrangement as he did with the others.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">&amp;apos;Hoping to finish his harvest that day, he went to the town square again at five o&amp;quot;clock and found more who were idle. So he said to them, &amp;quot;Why have you been here all day without work?&amp;quot;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">&amp;apos; &amp;quot;Because no one hired us,&amp;quot; they answered.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">&amp;apos;When evening came, the owner of the vineyard went to his foreman and said, &amp;quot;Call in all the laborers, line them up, and pay them the same wages, starting with the most recent ones I hired and finishing with the ones who worked all day.&amp;quot;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">&amp;apos;When those hired late in the day came to be paid, they were given a full day&amp;quot;s wage.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">And when those who had been hired first came to be paid, they were convinced that they would receive more. But everyone was paid the standard wage.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">When they realized what had happened, they were offended and complained to the landowner, saying,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">&amp;quot;You&amp;quot;re treating us unfairly! They&amp;quot;ve only worked for one hour while we&amp;quot;ve labored and sweated all day under the scorching sun. You&amp;quot;ve made them equal to us!&amp;quot;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">&amp;apos;The landowner replied, &amp;quot;Friends, I&amp;quot;m not being unfair&amp;ndash;I&amp;quot;m doing exactly what I said. Didn&amp;quot;t you agree to work for the standard wage?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">If I want to give those who only worked for an hour equal pay, what does that matter to you?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Don&amp;quot;t I have the right to do what I want with what is mine? Why should my generosity make you jealous of them?&amp;quot;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">&amp;apos; Now you can understand what I meant when I said that the first will end up last and the last will end up being first. Everyone is invited, but few are the chosen.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Jesus was about to go to Jerusalem, so he took his twelve disciples aside privately and said to them,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">&amp;apos;Listen to me. We&amp;quot;re on our way to Jerusalem, and I need to remind you that the Son of Man will be handed over to the religious leaders and scholars, and they will sentence him to be executed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">And they will hand him over to the Romans to be mocked, tortured, and crucified. Yet three days later he will be raised to life again.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">The wife of Zebedee approached Jesus with her sons, Jacob and John. She knelt before him and asked him for a favor.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">He said to her, &amp;apos;What is it that you want?&amp;apos; She answered, &amp;apos;Make the decree that these, my sons, will rule with you in your kingdom&amp;ndash;one sitting on your right hand, one on your left.&amp;apos; They answered him, &amp;apos;Yes, we are able.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Jesus replied, &amp;apos;You don&amp;quot;t know what you are asking.&amp;apos; Then, looking in the eyes of Jacob and John, Jesus said, &amp;apos;Are you prepared to drink from the cup of suffering that I am about to drink? And are you able to endure the baptism into death that I am about to endure?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">&amp;apos;You will indeed drink the cup of my suffering and be immersed into my death,&amp;apos; Jesus told them. &amp;apos;But to be the ones who sit at the place of highest honor is not mine to decide. My Father is the one who chooses them and prepares them.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">The other ten disciples were listening to all of this, and a jealous anger arose among them against the two brothers.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">Jesus, knowing their thoughts, called them to his side and said, &amp;apos;Kings and those with great authority in this world rule oppressively over their subjects, like tyrants.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">But this is not your calling. You will lead by a completely different model. The greatest one among you will live as the one who is called to serve others,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">because the greatest honor and authority is reserved for the one with the heart of a servant.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">For even the Son of Man did not come expecting to be served but to serve and give his life in exchange for the salvation of many.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">As Jesus left Jericho a huge crowd gathered and followed him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">And there were two blind men sitting on the roadside. When they heard that it was Jesus passing by, they shouted, &amp;apos;Son of David, show us mercy, Lord!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">Those in the crowd scolded them and told them to be quiet. But the blind men shouted even louder, &amp;apos;Jesus, Son of David, show us mercy, Lord!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">So Jesus stopped and had them brought to him. He asked them, &amp;apos;What do you want me to do for you?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">They said, &amp;apos;Lord, we want to see! Heal us!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">Jesus was deeply moved with compassion toward them. So he touched their eyes, and instantly they could see! Jesus said to them, &amp;apos;Your faith has healed you.&amp;apos; And all the people praised God because of this miracle. And the two men became his followers from that day onward.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="21">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Now, as they were approaching Jerusalem they arrived at the place of the stables near the Mount of Olives. Jesus sent two of his disciples ahead, saying,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">&amp;apos;As soon as you enter the village, you will find a donkey tethered along with her young colt. Untie them both and bring them to me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">And if anyone stops you and asks, &amp;quot;What are you doing?&amp;quot; just tell them, &amp;quot;The Lord of All needs them,&amp;quot; and he will let you take them.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">All of this happened to fulfill the prophecy:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Tell Zion&amp;quot;s daughter: &amp;apos;Look, your King arrives! He&amp;quot;s coming to you humbly, &amp;apos;Then neither will I tell you from where my power comes to do these things!&amp;apos; he replied. &amp;apos;There once was a man with two sons. The father came to the first and said, &amp;quot;Son, I want you to go and work in the vineyard today.&amp;quot; They answered him, &amp;apos;The first one.&amp;apos; Jesus said, &amp;apos;You&amp;quot;re right. For many sinners, tax collectors, and prostitutes are going into God&amp;quot;s kingdom realm ahead of you! The very stone the builder rejected as flawed has now become the most important isn&amp;quot;t it marvelous to behold? sitting on a donkey, riding on a donkey&amp;quot;s colt.&amp;apos; Jesus answered, &amp;apos;Yes, I hear them. But have you never read the Scripture, &amp;quot;From the lips of children and infants you have ordained praise&amp;quot;?&amp;apos; cornerstone. This was the Lord&amp;quot;s plan &amp;ndash;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">So the two disciples went on ahead and did as Jesus had instructed them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">They brought the donkey and her colt to him and placed their cloaks and prayer shawls on the colt, and Jesus rode on it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Then an exceptionally large crowd gathered and carpeted the road before him with their cloaks and prayer shawls. Others cut down branches from trees to spread in his path.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Jesus rode in the center of the procession&amp;ndash;crowds going before him and crowds coming behind him, and they all shouted, &amp;apos;Bring the victory, Lord, Son of David! He is the blessed one sent from the Lord Yahweh ! We celebrate with praises to God in the highest!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">As Jesus entered Jerusalem, the people went wild with excitement&amp;ndash;the entire city was thrown into an uproar!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Some asked, &amp;apos;Who is this man?&amp;apos; And the crowds shouted back, &amp;apos;This is Jesus! He&amp;quot;s the prophet from Nazareth of Galilee!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Upon entering Jerusalem Jesus went directly into the temple area and drove away all the merchants who were buying and selling their goods. He overturned the tables of the money changers and the stands of those selling doves.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">And he said to them, &amp;apos;My dwelling place will be known as a house of prayer, but you have made it into a hangout for thieves!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Then the blind and the crippled came into the temple courts, and Jesus healed them all. And the children circled around him shouting out, &amp;apos;Blessings and praises to the Son of David!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">But when the chief priests and religious scholars heard the children shouting and saw all the wonderful miracles of healing, they were furious.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">They said to Jesus, &amp;apos;Don&amp;quot;t you hear what these children are saying? This is not right!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Jesus then left at once for the nearby village of Bethany, where he spent the night.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">While walking back into the city the next morning, he got hungry.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">He noticed a lone fig tree by the side of the path and walked over to see if there was any fruit on it, but there was none&amp;ndash;he found only leaves. So he spoke to the fig tree and said, &amp;apos;You will be barren and will never bear fruit again!&amp;apos; Instantly the fig tree shriveled up right in front of their eyes!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Astonished, his disciples asked, &amp;apos;How did you make this fig tree instantly wither and die?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Jesus replied, &amp;apos;Listen to the truth. If you do not doubt God&amp;quot;s power and speak out of faith&amp;quot;s fullness, you can also speak to a tree and it will wither away. Even more than that, you could say to this mountain, &amp;quot;Be lifted up and be thrown into the sea&amp;quot; and it will be done.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Everything you pray for with the fullness of faith you will receive!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">After this Jesus went into the temple courts and taught the people. The leading priests and Jewish elders approached him and interrupted him and asked, &amp;apos;By what power do you do these things, and who granted you the authority to teach here?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">Jesus answered them, &amp;apos;I too have a question to ask you. If you can answer this question, then I will tell you by what power I do these things.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">Where did John&amp;quot;s authority to baptize come from? From heaven or from people?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">They stepped away and debated among themselves, saying, &amp;apos;How should we answer this? If we say from heaven, he will say to us, &amp;quot;Then why didn&amp;quot;t you respond to John and believe what he said?&amp;quot; But if we deny that God gave John his authority, we&amp;quot;ll be mobbed by the people, for they&amp;quot;re convinced that John was God&amp;quot;s prophet.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">So they finally answered, &amp;apos;We don&amp;quot;t know.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">Jesus said to his critics, &amp;apos;Tell me what you think of this parable :</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">The son replied, &amp;quot;I&amp;quot;d rather not.&amp;quot; But afterward, he deeply regretted what he said to his father, changed his mind, and decided to go to the vineyard.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">The father approached the second son and said the same thing to him. The son replied, &amp;quot;Father, I will go and do as you said.&amp;quot; But he never did&amp;ndash;he didn&amp;quot;t go to the vineyard.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">Tell me now, which of these two sons did the will of his father?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">John came to show you the path of righteousness, yet the despised and outcasts believed in him, but you did not. When you saw them turn, you neither repented of your ways nor believed his words.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">&amp;apos;Pay close attention to this parable,&amp;apos; Jesus said. &amp;apos;There once was an honorable man who planted a vineyard. He built a fence around it, dug out a pit for pressing the grapes, and erected a watchtower. Afterward he leased the land to tenant farmers and then went a distance away.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">At harvest time he sent his servants to the tenants to collect the portion that was due him as the lord of the vineyard.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">But the tenants seized his servants and beat one, killed another, and stoned another.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">So the landowner sent other servants, even more than at first, but they were mistreated the same way.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">Finally, he sent his own son to them, and he said to himself, &amp;quot;Perhaps with my own son standing before them they will be ashamed of what they&amp;quot;ve done.&amp;quot;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">But when the tenants saw the son, they said, &amp;quot;This is the heir! Let&amp;quot;s kill him and then we can have his inheritance!&amp;quot;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">So they seized him, took him outside the vineyard, and murdered him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">&amp;apos;You tell me, when the lord of the vineyard comes, what do you think he will do to those tenants?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">They answered, &amp;apos;He will bring a horrible death to those who did this evil and he will completely destroy them. Then he&amp;quot;ll lease his vineyard to different tenants who will be faithful to give him the portion he deserves.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">Jesus said to them, &amp;apos;Haven&amp;quot;t you ever read the Scripture that says:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43">&amp;apos;This is why I say to you that the kingdom realm of God will be taken from you and given to a people who will bear its fruit.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44">The one who comes against this stone will be broken, but the one on whom it falls will be pulverized!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45">When the leading priests and the Pharisees realized that the parable was referring to them, they were</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46">outraged and wanted to arrest him at once. But they were afraid of the reaction of the crowds, because the people considered him to be a prophet.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="22">
			<VERS vnumber="1">As was his custom, Jesus continued to teach the people by using allegories.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">He illustrated the reality of heaven&amp;quot;s kingdom realm by saying, &amp;apos;There once was a king who arranged an extravagant wedding feast for his son.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">On the day the festivities were set to begin, he sent his servants to summon all the invited guests, but they chose not to come.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">So the king sent even more servants to inform the invited guests, saying, &amp;quot;Come, for the sumptuous feast is now ready! The oxen and fattened cattle have been killed and everything is prepared, so come! Come to the wedding feast for my son and his bride!&amp;quot;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">&amp;apos;But the invited guests were not impressed. One was preoccupied with his business; another went off to his farming enterprise.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">And the rest seized the king&amp;quot;s messengers and shamefully mistreated them, and even killed them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">This infuriated the king! So he sent his soldiers to execute those murderers and had their city burned to the ground.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">&amp;apos;Then the king said to his servants, &amp;quot;The wedding feast is ready, yet those who had been invited to attend didn&amp;quot;t deserve the honor.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Now I want you to go into the streets and alleyways and invite anyone and everyone you find to come and enjoy the wedding feast in honor of my son.&amp;quot;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">&amp;apos;So the servants went out into the city streets and invited everyone to come to the wedding feast, good and bad alike, until the banquet hall was crammed with people!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Now, when the king entered the banquet hall, he looked with glee over all his guests. But then he noticed a guest who was not wearing the wedding robe provided for him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">So he said, &amp;quot;My friend, how is it that you&amp;quot;re here and you&amp;quot;re not wearing your wedding garment?&amp;quot; But the man was speechless.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">&amp;apos;Then the king turned to his servants and said, &amp;quot;Tie him up and throw him into the outer darkness, where there will be great sorrow, with weeping and grinding of teeth.&amp;quot;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">For everyone is invited to enter in, but few respond in excellence.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Then the Pharisees came together to make a plan to entrap Jesus with his own words.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">So they sent some of their disciples together with some staunch supporters of Herod. They said to Jesus, &amp;apos;Teacher, we know that you&amp;quot;re an honest man of integrity and you teach us the truth of God&amp;quot;s ways. We can clearly see that you&amp;quot;re not one who speaks only to win the people&amp;quot;s favor, because you speak the truth without regard to the consequences.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">So tell us, then, what you think. Is it proper for us Jews to pay taxes to Caesar or not?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Jesus knew the malice that was hidden behind their cunning ploy and said, &amp;apos;Why are you testing me, you imposters who think you have all the answers?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Show me one of the Roman coins.&amp;apos; So they brought him a silver coin used to pay the tax.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">&amp;apos;Now, tell me, whose head is on this coin and whose inscription is stamped on it?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">&amp;apos;Caesar&amp;quot;s,&amp;apos; they replied. Jesus said, &amp;apos;Precisely, for the coin bears the image of the emperor Caesar. Well, then, you should pay the emperor what is due to the emperor. But because you bear the image of God, give back to God all that belongs to him.&amp;apos; until I subdue all your enemies under your feet&amp;quot;?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">The imposters were baffled in the presence of all the people. When they realized once again that they were unable to trap Jesus, they went away stunned.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">Some of the Sadducees, a religious group that denied there was a resurrection of the dead, came to ask Jesus this question:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">&amp;apos;Teacher, the law of Moses teaches that if a man dies before he has children, his brother should marry the widow and raise up children for his brother&amp;quot;s family line.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">Now, there was a family with seven brothers. The oldest got married but soon died, leaving his widow for his brother.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">The second brother married and also died, and the third also. This was repeated down to the seventh brother,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">when finally the woman also died. So here&amp;quot;s our dilemma:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">Which of the seven brothers will be the woman&amp;quot;s husband when she&amp;quot;s resurrected from the dead, since they all were once married to her?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">Jesus answered them, &amp;apos;You are deluded, because your hearts are not filled with the revelation of the Scriptures or the power of God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">For after the resurrection, men and women will not marry, just like the angels of heaven don&amp;quot;t marry.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">Haven&amp;quot;t you read what God said:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">&amp;quot;I am the Living God, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob&amp;quot;? God is not the God of the dead, but of the living.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">When the crowds heard this they were dazed and astonished over his teaching!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">When the Pharisees heard that Jesus had silenced the Sadducees, they called a meeting to discuss how to trap Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">Then one of them, a religious scholar, posed this question to test him:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">&amp;apos;Teacher, which commandment in the law is the greatest?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">Jesus answered him, &amp;apos; &amp;quot;Love the Lord your God with every passion of your heart, with all the energy of your being, and with every thought that is within you.&amp;quot;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">This is the great and supreme commandment.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">And the second is like it in importance: &amp;quot;You must love your friend in the same way you love yourself.&amp;quot;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">Contained within these commandments to love you will find all the meaning of the Law and the Prophets.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">While all the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus took the opportunity to pose a question of his own:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">&amp;apos;What do you think about the Anointed One? Whose son is he?&amp;apos; &amp;apos;The son of David,&amp;apos; they replied. &amp;quot;Sit beside me in the place of authority</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43">Then Jesus said to them, &amp;apos;How is it that David, inspired by the Holy Spirit, could call his son the Lord? For didn&amp;quot;t he say:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44">The Lord said to my Lord,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45">&amp;apos;So how could David call his own son &amp;quot;the Lord&amp;quot;?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46">No one could come up with an answer. And from that day on none of the Pharisees had the courage to question Jesus any longer.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="23">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Then Jesus addressed both the crowds and his disciples and said,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">&amp;apos;The religious scholars and the Pharisees sit in Moses&amp;quot; seat as the authorized interpreters of the Law.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">So listen and follow what they teach, but don&amp;quot;t do what they do, for they tell you one thing and do another.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">They tie on your backs an oppressive burden of religious obligations and insist that you carry them, but will never lift a finger to help ease your load.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Everything they do is done for show and to be noticed by others. They want to be seen as holy , so they wear oversized prayer boxes on their arms and foreheads with Scriptures inside, and wear extra-long tassels on their outer garments.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">They crave the seats of highest honor at banquets and in their meeting places.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">And how they love to be admired by men with their titles of respect, aspiring to be recognized in public and have others call them &amp;quot;Reverend.&amp;quot;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">&amp;apos;But you are to be different from that. You are not to be called &amp;quot;master,&amp;quot; for you have only one Master, and you are all brothers and sisters.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">And you are not to be addressed as &amp;quot;father,&amp;quot; for you have one Father, who is in heaven.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Nor are you to be addressed as &amp;quot;teacher,&amp;quot; for you have one Teacher, the Anointed One.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">The greatest among you will be the one who always serves others.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Remember this: If you have a lofty opinion of yourself and seek to be honored, you will be humbled. But if you have a modest opinion of yourself and choose to humble yourself, you will be honored.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">&amp;apos;Great sorrow awaits you religious scholars and you Pharisees&amp;ndash;such frauds and pretenders! You do all you can to keep people from experiencing the reality of heaven&amp;quot;s kingdom realm. Not only do you refuse to enter in, you also forbid anyone else from entering in!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">&amp;apos; Great sorrow awaits you religious scholars and you Pharisees&amp;ndash;frauds and pretenders! For you eat up the widow&amp;quot;s household with the ladle of your prayers. Because of this, you will receive a greater judgment.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">&amp;apos;Great sorrow awaits you religious scholars and you Pharisees&amp;ndash;such frauds and pretenders! For you will travel over land and sea to find one disciple, only to make him twice the child of hell as yourselves.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">&amp;apos;You blind guides! Great sorrow awaits you, for you teach that there&amp;quot;s nothing binding when you swear by God&amp;quot;s temple, but if you swear by the gold of the temple, you are bound by your oath.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">You are deceived and blind! Which is greater, the gold or the temple that makes the gold sacred?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">And you say that whoever takes an oath by swearing, &amp;quot;By the altar,&amp;quot; it is nothing. But if you swear, &amp;quot;By the gift upon the altar,&amp;quot; then you are obligated to keep your oath.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">What deception! For what is greater, the gift or the altar that makes the gift sacred?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Whoever swears by the altar swears by the altar and everything offered on it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">And whoever swears by the temple swears by it and the one who dwells in it.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="23">&amp;apos;Great sorrow awaits you religious scholars and Pharisees&amp;ndash;frauds and pretenders! For you are obsessed with peripheral issues, like insisting on paying meticulous tithes on the smallest herbs that grow in your gardens. These matters are fine, yet you ignore the most important duties of all: to walk in the love of God, to display mercy to others, and to live with integrity. Readjust your values and place first things first.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">What blind guides! Nitpickers! You will spoon out a gnat from your drink, yet at the same time you&amp;quot;ve gulped down a camel without realizing it!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">&amp;apos;Great sorrow awaits you religious scholars and Pharisees&amp;ndash;frauds and imposters! You are like one who will only wipe clean the outside of a cup or bowl, leaving the inside filthy. You are foolish to ignore the greed and self-indulgence that live like germs within you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">You are blind to your evil. Shouldn&amp;quot;t the one who cleans the outside also be concerned with cleaning the inside? You need to have more than clean dishes; you need clean hearts!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">&amp;apos;Great sorrow awaits you religious scholars and Pharisees&amp;ndash;frauds and imposters! You are nothing more than tombs painted over with white paint&amp;ndash;tombs that look shining and beautiful on the outside but filled with rotting corpses on the inside.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">Outwardly you masquerade as righteous people, but inside your hearts you are full of hypocrisy and lawlessness.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">&amp;apos;Great sorrow awaits you religious scholars and Pharisees&amp;ndash;frauds and imposters! You build memorials for the prophets your ancestors killed and decorate the monuments of the godly people your ancestors murdered.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="34">&amp;apos;For this reason I will send you more prophets and wise men and teachers of truth. Some you will crucify, and some you will beat mercilessly with whips in your meeting houses, abusing and persecuting them from city to city.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1">As Jesus was leaving the temple courts, his disciples came to him and pointed out the beautiful architecture of the temple.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="3">Later, when they arrived at the Mount of Olives, his disciples came privately to where he was sitting and said, &amp;apos;Tell us, when will these things happen? And what sign should we expect to signal your coming and the completion of this age?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Jesus answered, &amp;apos;At that time deception will run rampant. So beware that you are not fooled!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">For many will appear on the scene claiming my authority or saying about themselves, &amp;quot;I am the Anointed One,&amp;quot; and they will lead many astray.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">&amp;apos;You will hear of wars and revolutions on every side, with more rumors of wars to come. Don&amp;quot;t panic or give in to your fears, for the breaking apart of the world&amp;quot;s systems is destined to happen. But it won&amp;quot;t yet be the end; it will still be unfolding.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">&amp;apos;Nations will go to war against nations and kingdoms against kingdoms. And there will be terrible earthquakes, horrible epidemics, and famines in place after place.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">This is how the birth pains of the new age will begin !&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">&amp;apos;You can expect to be persecuted, even killed; for you will be hated by all the nations because of your love for me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Then many will stop following me and fall away, and they will betray one another and hate one another.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">And many lying prophets will arise, deceiving multitudes and leading them away from the path of truth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">There will be such an increase of the sin of lawlessness that those whose hearts once burned with passion for God and others will grow cold.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">But hold your hope firmly to the end and you will experience life and deliverance.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">&amp;apos;Yet through it all, the good news of heaven&amp;quot;s kingdom will be proclaimed all over the world, providing every nation with a demonstration of the reality of God. And after that the end of this age will arrive.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">&amp;apos;When you witness what Daniel prophesied, &amp;quot;the disgusting destroyer,&amp;quot; taking its stand in the Holy Place [let the reader learn],</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="17">On that day, if you happen to be outside, don&amp;quot;t go back inside to gather belongings.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">And if you&amp;quot;re working out in the field, don&amp;quot;t run back home to get a coat.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="20">So pray that your escape will not be during the winter months or on a Sabbath.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">For this will be a time of great misery beyond the magnitude of anything the world has ever seen or ever will see. Unless God limited those days, no one would escape.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">But because of his love for those chosen to be his, he will shorten that time of trouble.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">&amp;apos;And you will hear reports from some, saying, &amp;quot;Look, he has returned,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;The Messiah is over here,&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;The Messiah is over there!&amp;quot; Don&amp;quot;t believe it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">For there will be imposters falsely claiming to be God&amp;quot;s &amp;quot;Anointed One,&amp;quot; and false prophets will arise to perform miracle signs to lead astray, if possible, those God has chosen to be his.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">Remember this, for I prophesy it will happen!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">So if someone says to you, &amp;quot;Look, the Anointed One has returned! He&amp;quot;s in the desert,&amp;quot; don&amp;quot;t go chasing after him. Or if they say to you, &amp;quot;Look, he&amp;quot;s here in our house,&amp;quot; don&amp;quot;t believe it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">The appearing of the Son of Man will burst forth with the brightness of lightning shining from the eastern sky to the west.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">How do birds of prey know where the dead body is? They just know instinctively, and so you will know when I appear.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">&amp;apos;Then immediately this is what will take place: &amp;quot;The sun will be darkened and the moon give no light. The stars will fall from the sky and all the cosmic powers will be shaken.&amp;quot;</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="36">&amp;apos;Concerning that day and exact hour, no one knows when it will arrive, not even the angels of heaven &amp;ndash;only the Father knows.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="38">Before the flood, people lived their lives eating, drinking, marrying, and having children.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">They didn&amp;quot;t realize the end was near until Noah entered the ark, and then suddenly, the flood came and took them all away in judgment. It will happen the same way when the Son of Man appears.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="45">&amp;apos;What would qualify a servant to manage his master&amp;quot;s house? He would be a wise servant who is both faithful and dependable. The master would commission him to oversee others, for he would lead them well and give them food at the right time.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1">&amp;apos;When my coming draws near, heaven&amp;quot;s kingdom realm can be compared to ten maidens who took their oil lamps and went outside to meet the bridegroom and his bride .</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="6">Then suddenly, in the middle of the night, they were awakened by the shout &amp;quot;Get up! The bridegroom is here! Come out and have an encounter with him!&amp;quot;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">So all the girls got up and trimmed their lamps.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">But the foolish ones were running out of oil, so they said to the five wise ones, &amp;quot;Share your oil with us, because our lamps are going out!&amp;quot;</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="10">&amp;apos;While the five girls were out buying oil, the bridegroom appeared. Those who were ready and waiting were escorted inside with him and the wedding party to enjoy the feast. And then the door was locked.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="18">But the one who had been entrusted with one thousand gold coins dug a hole in the ground and buried his master&amp;quot;s money.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="20">The one who was entrusted with five thousand gold coins came and brought ten thousand, saying, &amp;quot;See, I have doubled your money.&amp;quot;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">&amp;apos;Commending his servant, the master replied, &amp;quot;You have done well, and proven yourself to be my loyal and trustworthy servant.

			<VERS vnumber="24">&amp;apos;Then the one who had been entrusted with one thousand gold coins came to his master and said, &amp;quot;Look, sir. I know that you are a hard man to please and you&amp;quot;re a shrewd and ruthless businessman who grows rich on the backs of others.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">I was afraid of you, so I went and hid your money and buried it in the ground. But here it is&amp;ndash;take it, it&amp;quot;s yours.&amp;quot;</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="27">Then I would have received it all back with interest when I returned.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1">After Jesus had completed his teachings, he said to his disciples,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">&amp;apos;You know that the Feast of the Passover begins in two more days. That&amp;quot;s when the Son of Man will be betrayed and handed over to be crucified.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Meanwhile, the prominent priests and religious leaders of the nation were gathered in the palace of Caiaphas the high priest.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">That&amp;quot;s when they made their decision to secretly have Jesus captured and killed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">But they all agreed, &amp;apos;We can&amp;quot;t do this during the Passover celebrations or we could have a riot on our hands.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">When the disciples saw this, they were offended. &amp;apos;What a total waste!&amp;apos; they grumbled.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">&amp;apos;We could have sold it for a great deal of money and given it to the poor.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Jesus knew their thoughts and said to them, &amp;apos;Why are you critical of this woman? She has done a beautiful act of kindness.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">You will always have someone poor whom you can help, but you will not always have me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">When she poured the fragrant oil over me, she was preparing my body for burial.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">I promise you that when this wonderful gospel spreads all over the world, the story of her lavish devotion to me will also be mentioned in memory of her.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">One of the twelve apostles, Judas the locksmith, went to the leading priests</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">and said, &amp;apos;How much are you willing to pay me to betray Jesus into your hands?&amp;apos; They agreed to pay him thirty silver coins.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Immediately Judas began to scheme and look for an opportunity to betray him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">On the first day of Passover, the day when all bread made with yeast was removed from every Jewish home, the disciples came to Jesus and asked, &amp;apos;Where should we prepare the Passover meal for you?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">He answered them, &amp;apos;My heart longs with great desire to eat this Passover meal with you. Go into Jerusalem and you will encounter a man. Tell him that the teacher says, &amp;quot;My appointed time is near. I am coming to your home to eat the Passover meal with my disciples.&amp;quot; &amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">The disciples did as Jesus had instructed them, and they prepared the Passover meal.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">When evening came he took his place at the table and dined with the Twelve.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">While they were eating, Jesus spoke up and said, &amp;apos;One of you is about to betray me.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Feeling deeply hurt by these words, one after another asked him, &amp;apos;You don&amp;quot;t mean me, do you?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">He answered, &amp;apos;It is one who has shared meals with me as an intimate friend.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">All that was prophesied of me will take place, but how terrible it will be for the one who betrays the Son of Man. It would be far better for him if he had never been born!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">Then finally, Judas the traitor spoke up and asked him, &amp;apos;Teacher, perhaps it is I?&amp;apos; Jesus answered, &amp;apos;You said it.&amp;apos; I will strike down the shepherd Then the armed men seized Jesus to arrest him. At that point all of his disciples ran away and abandoned him. &amp;apos;He&amp;quot;s guilty and deserves the death penalty!&amp;apos; they answered.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">As they ate, Jesus took the bread and blessed it and broke it and gave it to his disciples. He said to them, &amp;apos;This is my body. Eat it.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">Then taking the cup of wine, he gave thanks to the Father, he entered into covenant with them, saying, &amp;apos;This is my blood. Each of you must drink it in fulfillment of the covenant.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">For this is the blood that seals the new covenant. It will be poured out for many for the complete forgiveness of sins.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">The next time we drink this, I will be with you and we will drink it together with a new understanding in the kingdom realm of my Father.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">Then they sang a psalm and left for the Mount of Olives.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">Along the way Jesus said to them, &amp;apos;Before the night is over, you will all desert me. This will fulfill the prophecy of the Scripture that says: and all the sheep will scatter far and wide!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">&amp;apos;But after I am risen, I will go ahead of you to Galilee and will meet you there.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">Then Peter spoke up and said, &amp;apos;Even if all the rest lose courage and fall away, I will still be beside you, Jesus!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">&amp;apos;Are you sure, Peter?&amp;apos; Jesus said. &amp;apos;In fact, before the rooster crows a few hours from now, you will have denied me three times.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">Peter replied, &amp;apos;I absolutely will never deny you, even if I have to die with you!&amp;apos; And all the others said the same thing.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">Then Jesus led his disciples to an orchard called &amp;apos;The Oil Press.&amp;apos; He told them, &amp;apos;Sit here while I go and pray nearby.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">He took Peter, Jacob, and John with him. However, an intense feeling of great sorrow plunged his soul into agony.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">And he said to them, &amp;apos;My heart is overwhelmed and crushed with grief. It feels as though I&amp;quot;m dying. Stay here and keep watch with me.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">Then he walked a short distance away, and overcome with grief, he threw himself facedown on the ground and prayed, &amp;apos;My Father, if there is any way you can deliver me from this suffering, please take it from me. Yet what I want is not important, for I only desire to fulfill your plan for me.&amp;apos; Then an angel from heaven appeared to strengthen him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">Later, he came back to his three disciples and found them all sound asleep. He awakened Peter and said to him, &amp;apos;Could you not stay awake with me for even one hour?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">Keep alert and pray that you&amp;quot;ll be spared from this time of testing. Your spirit is eager enough, but your humanity is weak.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">Then he left them for a second time to pray in solitude. He said to God , &amp;apos;My Father, if there is not a way that you can deliver me from this suffering, then your will must be done.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43">He came back to the disciples and found them sound asleep, for they couldn&amp;quot;t keep their eyes open.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44">So he left them and went away to pray the same prayer for the third time.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45">When he returned again to his disciples, he awoke them, saying, &amp;apos;Are you still sleeping? Don&amp;quot;t you know the hour has come for the Son of Man to be handed over to the authority of sinful men?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46">Get up and let&amp;quot;s go, for the betrayer has arrived.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="47">At that moment Judas, his once-trusted disciple, appeared, along with a large crowd of men armed with swords and clubs. They had been sent to arrest Jesus by order of the ruling priests and Jewish religious leaders.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="48">Now, Judas, the traitor, had arranged to give them a signal that would identify Jesus, for he had told them, &amp;apos;Jesus is the one whom I will kiss. So seize him!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="49">Judas quickly stepped up to Jesus and said, &amp;apos;Shalom, Rabbi,&amp;apos; and he kissed him on both cheeks .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="50">&amp;apos;My beloved friend,&amp;apos; Jesus said, &amp;apos;is this why you&amp;quot;ve come?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="51">But one of the disciples pulled out a dagger and swung it at the servant of the high priest, slashing off his ear.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="52">Jesus said to him, &amp;apos;Put your dagger away. For all those who embrace violence will die by violence.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="53">Don&amp;quot;t you realize that I could ask my heavenly Father for angels to come at any time to deliver me? And instantly he would answer me by sending more than twelve legions of angels to come and protect us.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="54">But that would thwart the prophetic plan of God. For it has been written that it would happen this way.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="55">Then Jesus turned to the mob and said, &amp;apos;Why would you arrest me with swords and clubs as though I were an outlaw? Day after day I sat in the temple courts with you, teaching the people, yet you didn&amp;quot;t arrest me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="56">But all of this fulfills the prophecies of the Scriptures.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="57">Those who arrested Jesus led him away to Caiaphas, the chief priest, and to a meeting where the religious scholars and the supreme Jewish council were already assembled.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="58">Now, Peter had followed the mob from a distance all the way to the chief priest&amp;quot;s courtyard. And after entering, he sat with the servants of the chief priest who had gathered there, waiting to see how things would unfold.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="59">The chief priests and the entire supreme Jewish council of leaders were doing their best to bring false charges against Jesus, because they were looking for a reason to put him to death.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="60">Many false witnesses came forward, but the evidence could not be corroborated. Finally two men came forward</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="61">and declared, &amp;apos;This man said, &amp;quot;I can destroy God&amp;quot;s temple and build it again in three days!&amp;quot; &amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="62">Then the chief priest stood up and said to Jesus, &amp;apos;Have you nothing to say about these allegations? Is what they&amp;quot;re saying about you true?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="63">But Jesus remained silent before them. So the chief priest said to him, &amp;apos;I charge you under oath&amp;ndash;in the name of the living God, tell us once and for all if you are the anointed Messiah, the Son of God!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="64">Jesus answered him, &amp;apos;You just said it yourself. And more than that, you are about to see the Son of Man seated at the right hand of God, the Almighty. And one day you will also see the Son of Man coming in the heavenly clouds!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="65">This infuriated the chief priest, and as an act of outrage, he tore his robe and shouted, &amp;apos;What blasphemy! No more witnesses are needed, for you heard this grievous blasphemy.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="66">Turning to the council he said, &amp;apos;Now, what is your verdict?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="67">Then they spat on his face and slapped him. Others struck him over and over with their fists.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="68">Then they taunted him by saying, &amp;apos;Oh, Anointed One, prophesy to us! Tell us which one of us is about to hit you next?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="69">Meanwhile, Peter was still sitting outside in the courtyard when a servant girl came up to him and said, &amp;apos;I recognize you. You were with Jesus the Galilean.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="70">In front of everyone Peter denied it and said, &amp;apos;I don&amp;quot;t have a clue what you&amp;quot;re talking about.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="71">Later, as he stood near the gateway of the courtyard, another servant girl noticed him and said, &amp;apos;I know this man is a follower of Jesus the Nazarene!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="72">Once again, Peter denied it, and with an oath he said, &amp;apos;I tell you, I don&amp;quot;t know the man!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="73">A short time later, those standing nearby approached Peter and said, &amp;apos;We know you&amp;quot;re one of his disciples&amp;ndash;we can tell by your speech. Your Galilean accent gives you away!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="74">Peter denied it, and using profanity he said, &amp;apos;I don&amp;quot;t know the man!&amp;apos; At that very moment the sound of a crowing rooster pierced the night.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="75">Then Peter remembered the prophecy of Jesus, &amp;apos;Before the rooster crows you will have denied me three times.&amp;apos; With a shattered heart, Peter left the courtyard, sobbing with bitter tears.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="27">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Before dawn that morning, all the chief priests and religious leaders resolved to take action against Jesus and decided that he should be executed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">So they bound him and led him away to Pilate, the Roman governor.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Now, when Judas, the betrayer, saw that Jesus had been sentenced to death, remorse filled his heart. He returned the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and religious leaders,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">saying, &amp;apos;I have sinned by betraying an innocent man.&amp;apos; They replied, &amp;apos;Why are you bothering us? That&amp;quot;s your problem.&amp;apos; the price at which he was valued by the people of Israel, Jesus answered, &amp;apos;You have just spoken it.&amp;apos; They shouted, &amp;apos;Barabbas.&amp;apos; They all shouted back, &amp;apos;Crucify him!&amp;apos; But they kept shouting out, &amp;apos;Crucify him!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Then Judas flung the silver coins inside the temple and went out and hanged himself.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">The chief priests, picking up the pieces of silver, said, &amp;apos;We can&amp;quot;t keep this, for it&amp;quot;s unlawful to put blood money into the temple treasury.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">So after some deliberation, they decided to purchase the potter&amp;quot;s field of clay , to use as a cemetery for burying strangers.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">That&amp;quot;s why that land has been called &amp;apos;The Field of Blood.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">This fulfilled the prophecy of Zechariah: They took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of a precious man, as the Lord directed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">And they bought the potter&amp;quot;s field,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">As Jesus stood in front of the Roman governor, Pilate asked him, &amp;apos;So, you are the king of the Jews?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Then he was accused by the chief priests and religious leaders, but he remained silent.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Pilate said, &amp;apos;Don&amp;quot;t you hear these allegations?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">But Jesus offered no defense to any of the charges, much to the great astonishment of Pilate.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Now, every year at Passover it was the custom of the governor to pardon a prisoner and release him to the people&amp;ndash;anyone they wanted.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">And at that time, Pilate was holding in custody a notorious criminal named Jesus Barabbas.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">So as the crowds of people assembled outside of Pilate&amp;quot;s residence, he went out and offered them a choice. He asked them, &amp;apos;Who would you want me to release to you today, Jesus who is called Barabbas, or Jesus who is called the Anointed One?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">(Now, Pilate was fully aware that the religious leaders had handed Jesus over to him because of their bitter jealousy.)</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Just then, as Pilate was presiding over the tribunal, his wife sent him an urgent message: &amp;apos;Don&amp;quot;t harm that holy man, for I suffered a horrible nightmare last night about him!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Meanwhile, the chief priest and the religious leaders were inciting the crowd to ask for Barabbas to be freed and to have Jesus killed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">So Pilate asked them again, &amp;apos;Which of the two men would you like me to release for you?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Pilate asked them, &amp;apos;Then what would you have me to do with Jesus who is called the Anointed One?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">&amp;apos;Why?&amp;apos; Pilate asked. &amp;apos;What has he done wrong?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">When Pilate realized that a riot was about to break out and that it was useless to try to reason with the crowd, he sent for a basin of water. After washing his hands in front of the people, he said, &amp;apos;I am innocent of the blood of this righteous man. The responsibility for his death is now yours!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">And the crowd replied, &amp;apos;Let his blood be on us and on our children!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">So he released Barabbas to the people. He ordered that Jesus be beaten with a whip of leather straps embedded with metal, and afterward be crucified.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">Then the guards took him into their military compound, where a detachment of nearly six hundred soldiers surrounded him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">They stripped off his clothing and placed a scarlet robe on him to make fun of him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">Then they braided a crown of thorns and forcefully shoved it onto his head. After placing a reed staff in his right hand, they knelt down before him and mocked him, saying, &amp;apos;Hail, king of the Jews!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">Then they spat in his face and took the reed staff from his hand and hit him repeatedly on his head, driving the crown of thorns deeper .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">When they finished ridiculing him, they took off the scarlet robe and put his own clothes back on him and led him away to be crucified.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">And as they came out of the city, they stopped an African man named Simon, from Libya, and compelled him to carry the cross for Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">They brought Jesus to Golgotha, which means &amp;apos;Skull Hill.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">And there the soldiers offered him a mild painkiller, a drink of wine mixed with gall, but after tasting it, he refused to drink it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">Then they crucified Jesus, nailing his hands and feet to the cross. The soldiers divided his clothing among themselves by rolling dice to see who would win them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">And the soldiers stood there to watch what would happen and to keep guard over him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">Above his head they placed a sign that read, &amp;apos;This is Jesus of Nazareth, King of Israel.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">Two criminals were also crucified with Jesus, one on each side of him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">And those who passed by shook their heads and ridiculed him,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">saying, &amp;apos;We heard you boast that you could destroy the temple and rebuild it in three days! Why don&amp;quot;t you save yourself now? If you&amp;quot;re really God&amp;quot;s Son, come down from the cross!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">Even the ruling priests, with the Jewish scholars and religious leaders, joined in the mockery</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">and kept on saying, &amp;apos;He saved others, but he can&amp;quot;t even save himself! Israel&amp;quot;s king, is he? He should pull out the nails and come down from the cross right now; then we&amp;quot;ll believe in him!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43">He puts his trust in God, so let&amp;quot;s see if it&amp;quot;s true, and see if God really wants to rescue him, for he said, &amp;quot;I am the Son of God.&amp;quot; &amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44">Even the two criminals who were crucified with Jesus began to taunt him, hurling their insults on him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45">For three hours, beginning at noon, a sudden and unexpected darkness came over the earth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46">And at three o&amp;quot;clock Jesus shouted with a mighty voice in Aramaic, &amp;apos;Eli, Eli, lema sabachthani?&amp;apos; &amp;ndash;that is, &amp;apos;My God, My God, why have you deserted me?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="47">Some who were standing near the cross misunderstood and said, &amp;apos;He&amp;quot;s calling for Elijah.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="48">One bystander ran and got a sponge, soaked it with sour wine, then put it on a stick and held it up for Jesus to drink.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="49">But the rest said, &amp;apos;Leave him alone! Let&amp;quot;s see if Elijah comes to rescue him.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="50">Jesus passionately cried out, took his last breath , and gave up his spirit.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="51">At that moment the veil in the Holy of Holies was torn in two from the top to the bottom. The earth shook violently, rocks were violently split apart,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="52">and graves were opened. Then many of the holy ones who had died were brought back to life and came out of their graves.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="53">And after Jesus&amp;quot; resurrection, they were seen by many people walking in Jerusalem.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="54">Now, when the Roman military officer and his soldiers witnessed what was happening and felt the powerful earthquake, they were extremely terrified. They said, &amp;apos;There is no doubt, this man was the Son of God!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="55">Watching from a distance were many of the women who had followed him from Galilee and given him support.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="56">Among them were Mary Magdalene; Mary, the mother of Jacob and Joseph; and the mother of Jacob and John.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="57">At the end of the day, a wealthy man named Joseph, a follower of Jesus from the village of Ramah,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="58">approached Pilate and asked if he could take custody of the body of Jesus. So Pilate consented and ordered that the body be given to him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="59">Then Joseph wrapped the body in a shroud of fine linen and placed it in his own unused tomb, which had only recently been cut into the rock.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="60">They rolled a large stone to seal the entrance of the tomb and left.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="61">Sitting across from the tomb were Mary Magdalene and the other Marys, watching all that took place.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="62">The next day, the day after Preparation Day for Passover, the chief priests and the Pharisees went together to Pilate.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="63">They said to him, &amp;apos;Our master, we remember that this imposter claimed that he would rise from the dead after three days.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="64">So please, order the tomb to be sealed until after the third day. Seal it so that his disciples can&amp;quot;t come and steal the corpse and tell people he rose from the dead. Then the last deception would be worse than the first!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="65">&amp;apos;I will send soldiers to guard the tomb,&amp;apos; Pilate replied. &amp;apos;Go with them and make the tomb as secure as possible.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="66">So they left and sealed the stone, and Pilate&amp;quot;s soldiers secured the tomb.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="28">
			<VERS vnumber="1">After the Sabbath ended, at the first light of dawn on the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to take a look at the tomb.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">The women were breathless and terrified, until the angel said to them, &amp;apos;There&amp;quot;s no reason to be afraid. I know you&amp;quot;re here looking for Jesus, who was crucified.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">He isn&amp;quot;t here&amp;ndash;he has risen victoriously, just as he said! Come inside the tomb and see the place where our Lord was lying.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Then run and tell his disciples that he has risen from the dead! I give you his message: &amp;quot;I am going ahead of you to Galilee and you will see me there.&amp;quot; &amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">They rushed quickly to tell his disciples, and their hearts were filled with fear, awe, and great joy at the same time.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Along the way, Jesus suddenly appeared in front of them and said, &amp;apos;Rejoice!&amp;apos; They were so overwhelmed by seeing him that they bowed down and grasped his feet in adoring worship.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Then Jesus said to them, &amp;apos;Throw off all your fears. Go and tell my brothers to go to Galilee. They will find me there.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">After the women left the tomb, a few of the guards went into Jerusalem and told the chief priests everything they had seen and heard.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">So the chief priests called a meeting with all the religious leaders and came up with a plan. They bribed the guards with a large sum of money</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">and told them, &amp;apos;Tell everyone, &amp;quot;While we were asleep, his disciples came at night and stole his body!&amp;quot;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">If Pilate finds out about this, don&amp;quot;t worry. We&amp;quot;ll make sure you don&amp;quot;t get blamed.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">So they took the money and did as they were told. (That is why the story of the guards is still circulated among the Jews to this day.)</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Meanwhile, the eleven disciples heard the wonderful news from the women and left for Galilee, to the mountain where Jesus had arranged to meet them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">The moment they saw him, they worshiped him, but some still had lingering doubts.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Then Jesus came close to them and said, &amp;apos;All authority of the universe has been given to me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Now wherever you go, make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">And teach them to faithfully follow all that I have commanded you. And never forget that I am with you every day, even to the completion of this age.&amp;apos;</VERS>

	<BIBLEBOOK bnumber="41" bname="Mark">
		<CHAPTER cnumber="1">
			<VERS vnumber="1">This is the beginning of the wonderful news about Jesus the Messiah, the Son of God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">It starts with Isaiah the prophet, who wrote: Listen! I am sending my messenger ahead of you for the coming of the Lord Yahweh , and clear a straight path inside your hearts for him!&amp;apos; and my greatest delight is in you!&amp;apos; and he will prepare your way! who shouts in the wilderness: &amp;apos;Prepare your hearts &amp;apos;You are my Son, my cherished one, Jesus&amp;quot; growing fame prevented him from entering the villages openly, which forced him to remain in isolated places. Even so, a steady stream of people flocked to him from everywhere.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">He is a thunderous voice of one</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">John the Baptizer was the messenger who appeared in the wilderness, preaching a baptism of repentance for the complete cancellation of sins.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">A steady stream of people came to be dipped in the Jordan River as they publicly confessed their sins. They came from all over southern Israel, including nearly all the inhabitants of Jerusalem.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">John wore a rough garment made from camel hair, with a leather belt around his waist, and he ate locusts and honey.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">And this is the message he kept preaching: &amp;apos;There is a man coming after me who is greater and a lot more powerful than I am. I&amp;quot;m not even worthy to bend down and untie the strap of his sandals.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">I&amp;quot;ve baptized you into water, but he will baptize you into the Spirit of Holiness!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">One day, Jesus came from the Galilean village of Nazareth and had John immerse him in the Jordan River.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">The moment Jesus rose up out of the water, John saw the heavenly realm split open, and the Holy Spirit descended upon him like a dove.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">At the same time, a voice spoke from heaven, saying:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Immediately after this he was compelled by the Holy Spirit to go into an uninhabited desert region.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">He remained there in the wilderness for forty days, enduring the ordeals of Satan&amp;quot;s tests. He encountered wild animals, but also angels who appeared and ministered to his needs.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Later on, after John the Baptizer was arrested, Jesus went back into the region of Galilee and preached the wonderful gospel of God&amp;quot;s kingdom.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">His message was this: &amp;apos;At last the fulfillment of the age has come! It is time for God&amp;quot;s kingdom to be experienced in its fullness! Turn your lives back to God and put your trust in the hope-filled gospel!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">As Jesus was walking along the shore of Lake Galilee, he noticed two brothers fishing: Simon and Andrew. He watched them as they were casting their nets into the sea</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">and said to them, &amp;apos;Come follow me and I will transform you into fishers of men instead of fish!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Immediately they dropped their nets and left everything behind to follow Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Walking a little farther, Jesus found two other brothers sitting in a boat, along with their father, mending their nets. Their names were Jacob and John, and their father Zebedee.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Jesus immediately walked up to them and invited the two brothers to become his followers. Jacob and John dropped their nets, stood up, left their father in the boat with the hired men, and followed Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Then Jesus and his disciples went to Capernaum, and he immediately started teaching on the Sabbath day in the synagogue.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">The people were awestruck by his teaching, because he taught in a way that demonstrated God&amp;quot;s authority, which was quite unlike the religious scholars.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">Suddenly, during the meeting, a demon-possessed man screamed out,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">&amp;apos;Hey! Leave us alone! Jesus the victorious, I know who you are. You&amp;quot;re God&amp;quot;s Holy One and you have come to destroy us!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">Jesus rebuked him, saying, &amp;apos;Silence! You are bound! Come out of him!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">The man&amp;quot;s body shook violently in spasms, and the demon hurled him to the floor until it finally came out of him with a deafening shriek!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">The crowd was awestruck and kept saying among themselves, &amp;apos;What is this new teaching that comes with such authority? With merely a word he commands demons to come out and they obey him!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">So the reports about Jesus spread like wildfire throughout every community in Galilee.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">Now, as soon as they left the meeting, they went straight to Simon and Andrew&amp;quot;s house, along with Jacob and John.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">Simon&amp;quot;s mother-in-law was bedridden, sick with a high fever, so the first thing they did was to tell Jesus about her.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">He walked up to her bedside, gently took her hand, and raised her up! Her fever disappeared and she began to serve them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">Later in the day, just after the Sabbath ended at sunset, the people kept bringing to Jesus all who were sick and tormented by demons,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">until the whole village was crowded around the house.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">Jesus healed many who were sick with various diseases and cast out many demons. But he would not permit the demons to speak, because they knew who he really was.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">The next morning, Jesus got up long before daylight, left the house while it was dark, and made his way to a secluded place to give himself to prayer.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">Later, Simon and his friends searched for him,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">and when they finally tracked him down, they told him, &amp;apos;Everyone is looking for you&amp;ndash;they want you!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">Jesus replied, &amp;apos;We have to go on to the surrounding villages so that I can share my message with the people there, for that is my mission.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">So he went throughout the region of Galilee, preaching in the Jewish synagogues and casting out demons.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">On one occasion, a leper came and threw himself down in front of Jesus, pleading for his healing, saying, &amp;apos;You have the power to heal me right now if only you really want to!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">Being deeply moved with tender compassion, Jesus reached out and touched the skin of the leper and told him, &amp;apos;Of course I want you to be healed&amp;ndash;so now, be cleansed!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">Instantly his leprous sores completely disappeared and his skin became smooth!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43">Jesus sent him away with a very stern warning,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44">saying, &amp;apos;Don&amp;quot;t say anything to anyone about what just happened , but go find a priest and show him that you&amp;quot;ve been healed. Then bring the offering that Moses commanded for your cleansing as a living testimony to everyone.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45">But no sooner did the man leave than he began to proclaim his healing publicly and tell the story everywhere.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="2">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Several days later, Jesus returned to Capernaum, and the news quickly spread that he was back in town.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Soon there were so many people crowded inside the house to hear him that there was no more room, even outside the door. While Jesus was preaching the word of God,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">four men arrived, carrying a paralyzed man.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">But when they realized that they couldn&amp;quot;t even get near him because of the crowd, they went up on top of the house and tore away the roof above Jesus&amp;quot; head. And when they had broken through, they lowered the paralyzed man on a stretcher right down in front of him !</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">When Jesus saw the extent of their faith, he said to the paralyzed man, &amp;apos;My son, your sins are now forgiven.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">This offended some of the religious scholars who were present, and they reasoned among themselves,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">&amp;apos;Who does he think he is to speak this way? This is blasphemy for sure! Only God himself can forgive sins!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Jesus supernaturally perceived their thoughts and said to them, &amp;apos;Why are you being so skeptical?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Which is easier, to say to this paralyzed man, &amp;quot;Your sins are now forgiven,&amp;quot; or, &amp;quot;Stand up and walk!&amp;quot;?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">But to convince you that the Son of Man has been given authority to forgive sins,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">I say to this man, &amp;quot;Stand up, pick up your stretcher, and walk home.&amp;quot; &amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Immediately the man was healed and sprang to his feet in front of everyone and left for home. When the crowd witnessed this miracle, they were awestruck. They shouted praises to God and said, &amp;apos;We&amp;quot;ve never seen anything like this before!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Jesus went out to walk near Lake Galilee, and a massive crowd gathered, so he taught them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">As he walked along, he found Levi, the son of Alphaeus, sitting at a tax booth, collecting taxes. He approached him and said, &amp;apos;Come follow me.&amp;apos; Immediately he got up from his booth and began to follow Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Later, Jesus and his disciples went to have a meal with Levi. Among the guests in Levi&amp;quot;s home were many tax collectors and notable sinners sharing a meal with Jesus, for there were many kinds of people who followed him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">But when the religious scholars and the Pharisees found out that Jesus was keeping company and dining with sinners and tax collectors, they were indignant. So they approached Jesus&amp;quot; disciples and said to them, &amp;apos;Why is it that someone like Jesus defiles himself by eating with sinners and tax collectors?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">But when Jesus overheard their complaint, he said to them, &amp;apos;Who goes to the doctor for a cure? Those who are well or those who are sick? I have not come to call the &amp;quot;righteous,&amp;quot; but those who are sinners and bring them to repentance.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">One time, the disciples of John the Baptizer and the Pharisees were fasting. So they came to Jesus and asked, &amp;apos;Why is it that John&amp;quot;s disciples and disciples of the Pharisees are fasting but your disciples are not?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Jesus answered, &amp;apos;How can the sons of the bridal chamber fast when the bridegroom is next to them? As long as the bridegroom is with them they won&amp;quot;t,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">but the days of fasting will come when the Bridegroom is taken from them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">&amp;apos;And who would mend worn-out clothing with new fabric? When the new cloth shrinks, it will rip, making the tear worse than before.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">And who would pour new wine into an old wineskin? Eventually the wine will ferment and make the wineskin burst, losing everything&amp;ndash;the wine will be spilled and the wineskin ruined. Instead, new wine is always poured into new wineskins.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">One Sabbath, Jesus and his disciples were walking through a field of wheat. The disciples were hungry, so they plucked off some heads of grain to eat.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">But when some of the Pharisees saw what was happening, they said to him, &amp;apos;Look! Your disciples shouldn&amp;quot;t be harvesting grain on the Sabbath!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">Jesus responded, &amp;apos;Haven&amp;quot;t you ever read what King David and his men did when they were hungry?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">They entered the house of God when Abiathar was high priest and ate the sacred bread of God&amp;quot;s presence. They violated the law by eating bread that only the priests were allowed to eat. But there is one here who is even greater than the temple.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">Then he said to them, &amp;apos;The Sabbath was made for the sake of people, and not people for the Sabbath.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">For this reason the Son of Man exercises his lordship over the Sabbath.&amp;apos;</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="3">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Then Jesus left them and went again into the synagogue, where he encountered a man who had an atrophied, paralyzed hand.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Everyone was watching Jesus closely to see if he would heal the man on the Sabbath, giving them a reason to accuse him of breaking Sabbath rules .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Jesus said to the man with the paralyzed hand, &amp;apos;Stand here in the middle of the room.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Then he turned to all those gathered there and said, &amp;apos;Is it against the law to do evil on the Sabbath or to do good? To destroy a life or to save one?&amp;apos; But no one answered him a word.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Then looking around at everyone, Jesus was moved with indignation and grieved by the hardness of their hearts and said to the man, &amp;apos;Now stretch out your hand!&amp;apos; As he stretched out his hand, it was instantly healed!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">After this happened, the Pharisees left abruptly and began to plot together with the friends and supporters of Herod Antipas on how they would kill Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Once again Jesus withdrew with his disciples to the lakeside, but a massive crowd of people followed him from all around the provinces of Galilee and southern Israel.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Vast crowds came from Jerusalem, Idumea, beyond the Jordan, and from Lebanon. Large numbers of people swarmed in from everywhere when they heard of him and his wonderful works.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">The crowd pressed so closely to Jesus that he instructed his disciples to bring him a small boat to get into and keep from being crushed by the crowd.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">For he had healed so many that the sick kept pushing forward just so they could touch Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">And whenever a demon saw him, it would throw the person down at Jesus&amp;quot; feet, screaming out, &amp;apos;You are the Son of God!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">But Jesus would silence the demons and sternly order them not to reveal who he was.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Afterward, Jesus went up on a mountainside and called to himself the men he wanted to be his close companions, so they went up with him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">He appointed the Twelve, whom he named apostles. He wanted them to be continually at his side as his friends, and so that he could send them out to preach</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">and have authority to heal the sick and to cast out demons.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">He appointed his Twelve and gave Simon the nickname Peter the Rock.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">And he gave the brothers, Jacob and John, the sons of Zebedee, the nickname Benay-Regah , which means &amp;apos;passionate sons.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">The others were Andrew, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, Jacob the son of Alphaeus, Thaddaeus, Simon the Nationalist,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">and Judas Iscariot, who betrayed him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Then Jesus went home, but once again a large crowd gathered around him, which prevented him from even eating a meal.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">When his own family heard that he was there, they went out to seize him, for they said, &amp;apos;He&amp;quot;s insane!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">The religious scholars who arrived from Jerusalem were saying, &amp;apos;Satan has possessed him! He casts out demons by the authority of the prince of demons!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">Jesus called them to himself and spoke to them using parables. &amp;apos;How can Satan cast out Satan?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">No kingdom can endure if it is divided against itself,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">and a fragmented household will not be able to stand, for it is divided.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">And if Satan fights against himself he will not endure, and his end has come.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">Jesus said to them, &amp;apos;Listen. No one is able to break into a mighty man&amp;quot;s house and steal his property unless he first overpowers the mighty man and ties him up. Then his entire house can be plundered and his possessions taken.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">I tell you this timeless truth: All sin will be forgiven, even all the blasphemies that are spoken.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">But there can never be forgiveness for the one who blasphemes against the Holy Spirit, for he is guilty of an eternal sin!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">(This is because they said he was empowered by a demon spirit.)</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">Then Jesus&amp;quot; mother and his brothers came and stood outside and sent a message to him, asking that he come out and speak with them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">When the crowd sitting around Jesus heard this, they spoke up, and said to him, &amp;apos;Jesus, your mother and brothers are outside looking for you.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">He answered them, &amp;apos;Who is my true mother and my true brothers?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">Then looking in the eyes of those who were sitting in a circle around him, he said, &amp;apos;Here are my true family members.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">For whoever does the will of God is my brother, my sister, and my mother!&amp;apos;</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="4">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Once again Jesus went to teach the people at the shore of Lake Galilee and a massive crowd surrounded him. The crowd was so huge that he had to get into a boat and teach the people from there.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">He taught them many things by using parables to illustrate spiritual truths, saying:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">&amp;apos;Consider this: A sower went out to sow.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">As he sowed some fell along the beaten path and soon the birds came and ate it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Some fell onto gravel with no topsoil and quickly sprouted since the soil had no depth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">But when the days grew hot, the sprouts were scorched and withered because they had insufficient roots.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Some fell among the thorns, and the thorns grew up and choked it, and it yielded no fruit.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">But some fell onto good, rich soil that kept producing a good harvest. Some yielded thirty, some sixty&amp;ndash;and some a hundredfold!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">If you understand this, then you need to respond.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Afterward, Jesus&amp;quot; disciples and those close to him remained behind to ask Jesus about his parables.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">He said to them, &amp;apos;The privilege of intimately knowing the mystery of God&amp;quot;s kingdom realm has been granted to you, but not to the others, where everything is revealed in parables.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">&amp;apos;For even when they see what I do, they will not understand, and when they hear what I say, they will learn nothing, otherwise they would repent and be forgiven.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Then he said to them, &amp;apos;If you don&amp;quot;t understand this parable, how will you understand any parable?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Let me explain: The farmer sows the message of the kingdom.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">What falls on the beaten path represents those who hear the message, but immediately Satan appears and snatches it from their hearts.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">And what is sown on gravel represents those who hear the message and receive it joyfully,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">but because their hearts fail to sink a deep root, they don&amp;quot;t endure for long. For when trouble or persecution comes on account of the message, they immediately wilt and fall away.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">And what is sown among thorns represents those who hear the message,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">but they allow the cares of this life and the seduction of wealth and the desires for other things to crowd out and choke the message so that it produces nothing.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">&amp;apos;But what is sown on good soil represents those who open their hearts to receive the message and their lives bear good fruit&amp;ndash;some yield a harvest of thirty, sixty, even a hundredfold!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">He also gave them this parable: &amp;apos;No one lights a lamp only to place it under a basket or under the bed. It is meant to be placed on a lampstand.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">For there is nothing that is hidden that won&amp;quot;t be disclosed, and there is no secret that won&amp;quot;t be brought out into the light!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">If you understand what I&amp;quot;m saying, you need to respond!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">Then he said to them, &amp;apos;Be diligent to understand the meaning behind everything you hear, for as you do, more understanding will be given to you. And according to your longing to understand, much more will be added to you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">For those who listen with open hearts will receive more revelation. But those who don&amp;quot;t listen with open hearts will lose what little they think they have!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">Jesus also told them this parable: &amp;apos;God&amp;quot;s kingdom realm is like someone spreading seed on the ground.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">He goes to bed and gets up, day after day, and the seed sprouts and grows tall, though he knows not how.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">All by itself it sprouts, and the soil produces a crop; first the green stem, then the head on the stalk, and then the fully developed grain in the head.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">Then, when the grain is ripe, he immediately puts the sickle to the grain, because harvest time has come.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">And he told them this parable: &amp;apos;How can I describe God&amp;quot;s kingdom realm? Let me illustrate it with this parable.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">It is like the mustard seed, the tiniest of all the seeds,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">yet when it springs up and grows, it becomes the largest plant in the garden, with so many large spreading branches, even birds can nest in its shade.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">Jesus used many parables such as these as he taught the people, and they learned according to their ability to understand.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">He never spoke to them without using parables, but would wait until he was alone with his disciples to explain to them their meanings.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">That same day, after it grew dark, Jesus said to his disciples, &amp;apos;Let&amp;quot;s cross over to the other side of the lake.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">Leaving the crowd behind, the disciples got into the boat in which Jesus was already sitting, and they took him with them. Other boats sailed with them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">Suddenly, as they were crossing the lake, a ferocious storm arose, with violent winds and waves that were crashing into the boat until it was nearly swamped.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">But Jesus was calmly sleeping in the stern, resting on a cushion.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">So they shook him awake, saying, &amp;apos;Teacher, don&amp;quot;t you even care that we are all about to die!&amp;apos; Fully awake, he rebuked the storm and shouted to the sea, &amp;apos;Hush! Be still!&amp;apos; All at once the wind stopped howling and the water became perfectly calm.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">Then he turned to his disciples and said to them, &amp;apos;Why are you so afraid? Haven&amp;quot;t you learned to trust yet?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">But they were overwhelmed with fear and awe and said to one another, &amp;apos;Who is this man who has such authority that even the wind and waves obey him?&amp;apos;</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="5">
			<VERS vnumber="1">They arrived at the other side of the lake, at the region of the Gerasenes.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">As Jesus stepped ashore, a demon-possessed madman came out of the graveyard and confronted him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">The man had been living there among the tombs, and no one was able to restrain him, not even with chains.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">For every time they attempted to chain his hands and feet with shackles, he would snap the chains and break the shackles in pieces. He was so strong that no one had the power to subdue him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Day and night he could be found lurking in the cemetery or in the vicinity, shrieking and cutting himself with stones!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">When he saw Jesus from a distance, he ran to him and threw himself down before him,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">shouting at the top of his lungs, &amp;apos;Leave me alone, Jesus, Son of the Most High God! Swear in God&amp;quot;s name that you won&amp;quot;t torture me!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">(For Jesus had already said to him, &amp;apos;Come out of that man, you demon spirit!&amp;apos; )</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Jesus said to him, &amp;apos;What is your name?&amp;apos; &amp;apos;Mob,&amp;apos; he answered. &amp;apos;They call me Mob because there are thousands of us in his body!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">He begged Jesus repeatedly not to expel them out of the region.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Nearby there was a large herd of pigs feeding on the hillside.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">The demons begged him, &amp;apos;Send us into the pigs. Let us enter them!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">So Jesus gave them permission, and the demon horde immediately came out of the man and went into the pigs! This caused the herd to rush madly down the steep slope and fall into the lake, drowning about two thousand pigs!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">At this, the herdsmen ran to the nearby villages, telling everyone along the way what had happened, and the people came out to see for themselves.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">When they found Jesus, they saw the demonized man sitting there, properly clothed and in his right mind. Seeing what had happened to the man possessed by many demons, the people became afraid.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Those who had witnessed this miracle reported the news to the people and included what had happened to the pigs.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Then they asked Jesus to leave their region.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">And as Jesus began to get into the boat to depart, the man who had been set free from demons asked him, &amp;apos;Could I go with you?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Jesus answered, &amp;apos;No,&amp;apos; but said to him, &amp;apos;Go back to your home and to your family and tell them what the Lord has done for you. Tell them how he had mercy on you.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">So the man left and went into the region of Jordan and parts of Syria to tell everyone he met about what Jesus had done for him, and all the people marveled!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">After Jesus returned from across the lake, a huge crowd of people quickly gathered around him on the shoreline.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Just then, a man saw that it was Jesus, so he pushed through the crowd and threw himself down at his feet. His name was Jairus, a Jewish official who was in charge of the synagogue.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">He pleaded with Jesus, saying over and over, &amp;apos;Please come with me! My little daughter is at the point of death, and she&amp;quot;s only twelve years old ! Come and lay your hands on her and heal her and she will live!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">Immediately Jesus went with him, and the huge crowd followed, pressing in on him from all sides.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">Now, in the crowd that day was a woman who had suffered horribly from continual bleeding for twelve years.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">She had endured a great deal under the care of various doctors, yet in spite of spending all she had on their treatments, she was getting worse instead of better.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">When she heard about Jesus&amp;quot; healing power , she pushed through the crowd and came up from behind him and touched his prayer shawl.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">For she kept saying to herself, &amp;apos;If I could touch even his clothes, I know I will be healed.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">As soon as her hand touched him, her bleeding immediately stopped! She knew it, for she could feel her body instantly being healed of her disease!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">Jesus knew at once that someone had touched him, for he felt the power that always surged around him had passed through him for someone to be healed. He turned and spoke to the crowd, saying, &amp;apos;Who touched my clothes?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">His disciples answered, &amp;apos;What do you mean, who touched you? Look at this huge crowd&amp;ndash;they&amp;quot;re all pressing up against you.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">But Jesus&amp;quot; eyes swept across the crowd, looking for the one who had touched him for healing.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">When the woman who experienced this miracle realized what had happened to her, she came before him, trembling with fear, and threw herself down at his feet, saying, &amp;apos;I was the one who touched you.&amp;apos; And she told him her story of what had just happened.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">Then Jesus said to her, &amp;apos;Daughter, because you dared to believe, your faith has healed you. Go with peace in your heart, and be free from your suffering!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">And before he had finished speaking, people arrived from Jairus&amp;quot; house and pushed through the crowd to give Jairus the news: &amp;apos;There&amp;quot;s no need to trouble the master any longer&amp;ndash;your daughter has died.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">But Jesus refused to listen to what they were told and said to the Jewish official, &amp;apos;Don&amp;quot;t yield to fear. All you need to do is to keep on believing.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">So they left for his home , but Jesus didn&amp;quot;t allow anyone to go with them except Peter and the two brothers, Jacob and John.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">When they arrived at the home of the synagogue ruler, they encountered a noisy uproar among the people, for they were all weeping and wailing.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">Upon entering the home, Jesus said to them, &amp;apos;Why all this grief and weeping? Don&amp;quot;t you know the girl is not dead but merely asleep?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">Then everyone began to ridicule and make fun of him. But he threw them all outside. Then he took the child&amp;quot;s father and mother and his three disciples and went into the room where the girl was lying.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">He tenderly clasped the child&amp;quot;s hand in his and said to her in Aramaic, &amp;apos;Talitha koum,&amp;apos; which means, &amp;apos;Little girl, wake up from the sleep of death.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">Instantly the twelve-year-old girl sat up, stood to her feet, and started walking around the room! Everyone was overcome with astonishment in seeing this miracle!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43">Jesus had them bring her something to eat. And he cautioned them repeatedly that they were to tell no one about what had happened.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="6">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Afterward, Jesus left Capernaum and returned with his disciples to Nazareth, his hometown.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">On the Sabbath, he went to teach in the synagogue. Everyone who heard his teaching was overwhelmed with astonishment. They said among themselves, &amp;apos;What incredible wisdom has been given to him! Where did he receive such profound insights? And what mighty miracles flow through his hands!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Isn&amp;quot;t this Mary&amp;quot;s son, the carpenter, the brother of Jacob, Joseph, Judah, and Simon? And don&amp;quot;t his sisters all live here in Nazareth?&amp;apos; And they took offense at him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Jesus said to them, &amp;apos;A prophet is treated with honor everywhere except in his own hometown, among his relatives, and in his own house.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">He was unable to do any great miracle in Nazareth, except to heal a few sick people by laying his hands upon them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">He was amazed at the depth of their unbelief! Then Jesus went out into the different villages and taught the people.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Jesus gathered his twelve disciples and imparted to them his authority to cast out demons. Then he sent them out in pairs with these instructions:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">And whatever house you enter, stay there until you leave the area.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Whatever community does not welcome you or receive your message, leave it behind. And as you go, shake the dust off your feet as a testimony against them.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">So they went out and preached publicly that everyone should repent.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">They cast out many demons and anointed many sick people with oil and healed them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">King Herod soon heard about Jesus, for the name of Jesus was on everyone&amp;quot;s lips. Some were even saying about him, &amp;apos;John the Baptizer has been raised from the dead, and that&amp;quot;s why miraculous powers flow from him!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Others said, &amp;apos;No, he&amp;quot;s Elijah!&amp;apos; While others said, &amp;apos;He&amp;quot;s a prophet, like one of the prophets of old!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">When Herod heard what the people were saying, he concluded, &amp;apos;I beheaded John, and now he&amp;quot;s raised from the dead!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">This infuriated Herodias, and she held a bitter grudge against him and wanted John executed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">But Herod both feared and stood in awe of John and kept him safely in custody, because he was convinced that he was a righteous and holy man. Every time Herod heard John speak, it disturbed his soul, but he was drawn to him and was intrigued by his words.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">But Herodias found her opportunity to have John killed&amp;ndash;it was on the king&amp;quot;s birthday! Herod prepared a great banquet and invited all his officials, military commanders, and the leaders of the province of Galilee to celebrate with him on his birthday.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">On the day of the feast, his stepdaughter, the daughter of Herodias, came to honor the king with a beautiful dance, and she flattered him. Her dancing greatly pleased the king and his guests, so he said to the girl, &amp;apos;You can ask me for anything you want and I will give it to you!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">And he repeated it in front of everyone, with a vow to complete his promise to her: &amp;apos;Anything you desire and it will be yours! I&amp;quot;ll even share my kingdom with you!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">She immediately left the room and said to her mother, &amp;apos;What should I ask for?&amp;apos; Her mother answered, &amp;apos;The head of John the Baptizer on a platter!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">So she hurried back to the king and made her request: &amp;apos;I want you to bring me the head of John the Baptizer on a platter&amp;ndash;and I want it right now!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">Deeply grieved, the king regretted his promise to her, but since he had made his vow in front of all his honored guests, he couldn&amp;quot;t deny her request.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">So without delay the king ordered an executioner to bring John&amp;quot;s head, and he went and beheaded John in prison.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">He brought his head on a platter and gave it to the girl, and the girl brought it to her mother.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">When John&amp;quot;s followers heard what had happened, they came and removed his body and laid it in a tomb.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">The apostles returned from their mission and gathered around Jesus and told him everything they had done and taught.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">There was such a swirl of activity around Jesus, with so many people coming and going, that they were unable to even eat a meal. So Jesus said to his disciples, &amp;apos;Come, let&amp;quot;s take a break and find a secluded place where you can rest a while.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">They slipped away and left by sailboat for a deserted spot.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">But many of the people saw them leaving and realized where they were headed, so they took off running along the shore. Then people from the surrounding towns joined them in the chase, and a large crowd got there ahead of them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">By the time Jesus came ashore, a massive crowd was waiting. At the sight of them, his heart was filled with compassion, because they seemed like wandering sheep who had no shepherd. So he taught them many wonderful things.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">Late that afternoon, his disciples said, &amp;apos;It&amp;quot;s getting really late and we&amp;quot;re here in this remote place with nothing to eat.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">You should send the crowds away so they can go into the surrounding villages and buy food.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">But he answered them, &amp;apos;You give them something to eat.&amp;apos; &amp;apos;Are you sure?&amp;apos; they replied. &amp;apos;You really want us to go buy them supper? It would cost a small fortune to feed all these thousands of hungry people.&amp;apos; When it was almost morning, Jesus came to them, walking on the surface of the water, and he started to pass by them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">&amp;apos;How many loaves of bread do you have?&amp;apos; he asked. &amp;apos;Go and see.&amp;apos; After they had looked around, they came back and said, &amp;apos;Five&amp;ndash;plus a couple of fish.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">Then he instructed them to organize the crowd and have them sit down in groups on the grass.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">So they had them sit down in groups of hundreds and fifties.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">Then Jesus took the five loaves and two fish, gazed into heaven, and gave thanks to God. He broke the bread and the two fish and distributed them to his disciples to serve the people&amp;ndash; and the food was multiplied in front of their eyes !</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">Everyone had plenty to eat and was fully satisfied.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43">Then the twelve disciples picked up what remained, and each of them ended up with a basket full of leftovers!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44">Altogether, five thousand families were fed that day!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45">After everyone had their meal, Jesus instructed his disciples to get back into the boat and go on ahead of him and sail to the other side to Bethsaida.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46">So he dispersed the crowd, said good-bye to his disciples, then slipped away to pray on the mountain.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="47">As night fell, the boat was in the middle of the lake and Jesus was alone on land.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="48">The wind was against the disciples and he could see that they were straining at the oars, trying to make headway.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="51">Then he came closer and climbed into the boat with them, and immediately the stormy wind became still. They were completely and utterly overwhelmed with astonishment.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="52">Their doubting hearts had not grasped his authority and power over all things in spite of just having witnessed the miraculous feeding .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="53">They made landfall at Gennesaret and anchored there.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="54">The moment they got out of the boat, everyone recognized that it was Jesus, the healer !</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="55">So they ran throughout the region, telling the people, &amp;apos;Bring all the sick&amp;ndash;even those too sick to walk and bring them on mats!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="56">Wherever he went, in the countryside, villages, or towns, they placed the sick on mats in the streets or in public places and begged him, saying, &amp;apos;Just let us touch the tassel of your prayer shawl!&amp;apos; And all who touched him were instantly healed!</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="7">
			<VERS vnumber="1">One day, the Pharisees and certain religious scholars came from Jerusalem and gathered around Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">They were shocked to find that some of Jesus&amp;quot; disciples ate bread without first observing the Jewish ritual of hand washing before eating their meal.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">(For the Pharisees, like all other Jews, will not eat without first performing a ritual of pouring water over their cupped hands to keep the tradition of the elders.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Similarly, when returning from the marketplace, they ceremonially wash themselves before eating. They also observed many other traditions, such as ceremonially washing cups, pitchers, and kettles.)</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">So the Pharisees and religious scholars asked Jesus, &amp;apos;Why don&amp;quot;t your disciples live according to the age-old traditions passed down by our elders? They should first ceremonially wash their hands before eating.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Jesus replied, &amp;apos;You are hypocrites! How accurately did Isaiah prophesy about you phonies when he said: &amp;quot;These people honor me with their words while their hearts run far away from me! For they continue to insist that their man-made traditions and,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Their worship is nothing more than a charade! are equal to the instructions of God.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Honor your father and mother,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Whoever insults or mistreats his father or mother must be put to death.&amp;quot;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">&amp;apos;You abandon God&amp;quot;s commandments just to keep men&amp;quot;s rituals, such as ceremonially washing utensils, cups, and other things.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Then he added, &amp;apos;How skillful you&amp;quot;ve become in rejecting God&amp;quot;s law in order to maintain your man-made set of rules.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">For example, Moses taught us:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">&amp;apos;But your made-up rules allow a person to say to his parents, &amp;quot;I&amp;quot;ve decided to take the support you were counting on from me and make it my holy offering to God, and that will be your blessing instead.&amp;quot;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">How convenient! The rules you teach exempt him from providing for his aged parents.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Do you really think God will honor your traditions passed down to others, making up rules that nullify God&amp;quot;s Word? And you&amp;quot;re doing many other similar things.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Then Jesus called the crowd together again, saying, &amp;apos;Hear my words, all of you, and take them to heart.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">What truly contaminates a person is not what he puts into his body, but what comes out. That&amp;quot;s what makes a person defiled.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">When Jesus went back home and away from the crowd, his disciples acknowledged that they didn&amp;quot;t understand the meaning of the parable and asked him to explain it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">He answered them, &amp;apos;Are you as dull as the rest? Don&amp;quot;t you understand that you are not defiled by what you eat?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">For the food you swallow doesn&amp;quot;t enter your heart, but goes into your stomach, only to pass out into the sewer.&amp;apos; (This means all foods are clean.)</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">He added, &amp;apos;Words and deeds pollute a person, not food.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Evil originates from inside a person. Coming out of a human heart are evil schemes, sexual immorality, theft, murder,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">adultery, greed, wickedness, treachery, debauchery, jealousy, slander, arrogance, and recklessness.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">All these corrupt things emerge from within and constantly defile a person.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">Jesus set out from there to go into the non-Jewish region of Tyre. He intended to slip into a house unnoticed, but people found out that he was there.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">But when a woman whose daughter had a demon spirit heard he was there, she came and threw herself down at his feet.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">She was not Jewish, but a foreigner, born in the part of Syria known as Phoenicia. She begged him repeatedly to cast the demon out of her daughter.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">Finally he said to her, &amp;apos;First let my children be fed and satisfied, for it isn&amp;quot;t fair to take the children&amp;quot;s bread and throw it to the little dogs.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">She answered, &amp;apos;How true that is, Lord. But even puppies under the family table are allowed to eat the little children&amp;quot;s crumbs.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">Then Jesus said to her, &amp;apos;That&amp;quot;s a good reply! Now, because you said this, you may go. The demon has permanently left your daughter.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">And when she returned home, she found her daughter resting quietly on the couch, completely set free from the demon!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">After this, Jesus left the coastland of Tyre and came through Sidon on his way to Lake Galilee and over into regions of Syria.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">Some people brought to him a deaf man with a severe speech impediment. They pleaded with Jesus to place his hands on him and heal him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">So Jesus led him away from the crowd to a private spot. Then he stuck his fingers into the man&amp;quot;s ears and placed some of his saliva on the man&amp;quot;s tongue.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">Then he gazed into heaven, sighed deeply, and spoke to the man&amp;quot;s ears and tongue, &amp;apos;Ethpathakh,&amp;apos; which is Aramaic for &amp;apos;Open up, now!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">At once the man&amp;quot;s ears opened and he could hear perfectly, and his tongue was untied and he began to speak normally.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">Jesus ordered everyone to keep this miracle a secret, but the more he told them not to, the more the news spread!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">The people were absolutely beside themselves and astonished beyond measure. And they began to declare, &amp;apos;Everything he does is wonderful! He even makes the deaf hear and the mute speak!&amp;apos;</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="8">
			<VERS vnumber="1">During those days, another massive crowd gathered to hear Jesus, and again, there was no food and the people were hungry. So Jesus called his disciples to come near him and said to them,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">&amp;apos;My heart goes out to this crowd, for they&amp;quot;ve already been here with me for three days with nothing to eat.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">I&amp;quot;m concerned that if I send them home hungry, some may faint along the way, for many have come a long, long way just to be with me.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">His disciples replied, &amp;apos;But could anyone possibly get enough food to satisfy a crowd this size out here in this isolated place?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">He asked them, &amp;apos;How many loaves of flatbread do you have?&amp;apos; &amp;apos;Seven,&amp;apos; they replied. &amp;apos;Twelve,&amp;apos; they replied. &amp;apos;Seven,&amp;apos; they replied.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Jesus instructed the crowd to sit down on the grass. After he took the seven loaves, he gave thanks to God, broke them, and started handing them to his disciples. They kept distributing the bread until they had served the entire crowd.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">They also had a few small fish, and after giving thanks for these, Jesus had his disciples serve them to the crowd.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Everyone ate until they were satisfied. Then the disciples gathered up the broken pieces and filled seven large baskets with the leftovers.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">About four thousand people ate what had been multiplied! Then he dismissed the crowd.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Afterward, Jesus got into a boat and sailed to the vicinity of Dalmanutha.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">As soon as Jesus landed, he was confronted by the Pharisees, who argued with Jesus and tested him. They demanded that he give them a miraculous sign from heaven.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">With a deep sigh from his spirit, he said, &amp;apos;What drives this generation to clamor for a sign? Listen to the truth: there will absolutely be no sign given to this generation!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Then he turned and left them, got back into the boat, and crossed over to the opposite shore.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Now, the disciples had forgotten to take bread with them, except for one loaf of flatbread.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">And as they were sailing across the lake , Jesus repeatedly warned them, &amp;apos;Be on your guard against the yeast inside of the Pharisees and the yeast inside of Herod!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">But the disciples had no clue what Jesus was talking about, so they began to discuss it among themselves, saying, &amp;apos;Is he saying this because we forgot to bring bread?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Knowing what they were thinking, Jesus said to them, &amp;apos;Why all this fussing over forgetting to bring bread? Do you still not see or understand what I say to you? Are your hearts still hard?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">You have good eyes, yet you still don&amp;quot;t see, and you have good ears, yet you still don&amp;quot;t hear, neither do you remember.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">When I multiplied the bread to feed more than five thousand people, how many baskets full of leftovers did you gather afterward?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">&amp;apos;And when I multiplied food to feed over four thousand, how many large baskets full of leftovers did you gather afterwards?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">&amp;apos;Then how is it that you still don&amp;quot;t get it?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">When they arrived at Bethsaida, some people brought a blind man to Jesus, begging him to touch him and heal him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">So Jesus led him, as his sighted guide, outside the village. He placed his saliva on the man&amp;quot;s eyes and covered them with his hands. Then he asked him, &amp;apos;Now do you see anything?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">&amp;apos;Yes,&amp;apos; he said. &amp;apos;My sight is coming back! I&amp;quot;m beginning to see people, but they look like trees&amp;ndash;walking trees.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">Jesus put his hands over the man&amp;quot;s eyes a second time and made him look up . The man opened his eyes wide and he could see everything perfectly. His eyesight was completely restored!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">Then Jesus sent him home with these instructions: &amp;apos;Go home, but don&amp;quot;t tell anyone what happened, not even the people of your own village.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">Then Jesus and his disciples walked to the villages near Caesarea Philippi. On the way, he posed this question to his disciples: &amp;apos;Who do the people say that I am?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">They replied, &amp;apos;Some say John the Baptizer, others say Elijah the prophet, and still others say you must be one of the prophets.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">He asked them, &amp;apos;But who do you say that I am?&amp;apos; Peter spoke up, saying, &amp;apos;You are the Messiah, the Son of the Living God!&amp;apos; Then Peter took him aside and rebuked him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">Then he warned them not to breathe a word of this to anyone.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">From then on, Jesus began to tell his disciples that he, the Son of Man, was destined to go to Jerusalem and suffer great injustice from the elders, leading priests, and religious scholars. He also explained that he would be killed and three days later be raised to life again.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">Jesus opened his heart and spoke freely with his disciples, explaining all these things to them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">But Jesus turned around, and glancing at all of the other disciples, he rebuked Peter, saying, &amp;apos;Get out of my sight, Satan! For your heart is not set on God&amp;quot;s plan but man&amp;quot;s!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">Jesus had his disciples and the crowd gather around him. And he said to them: &amp;apos;If you truly want to follow me, you should at once completely disown your own life. And you must be willing to share my cross and experience it as your own, as you continually surrender to my ways.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">For if you let your life go for my sake and for the sake of the gospel, you will continually experience true life. But if you choose to keep your life for yourself, you will forfeit what you try to keep.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">For what use is it to gain all the wealth and power of this world, with everything it could offer you, at the cost of your own life?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">And what could be more valuable to you than your own soul?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">If you are ashamed of me and my words while living among sinful and faithless people, then I, the Son of Man, will also be ashamed of you when I make my appearance with my holy messengers in the glorious splendor of my Father!&amp;apos;</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="9">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Jesus said to them, &amp;apos;I tell you the truth, there are some standing here now who won&amp;quot;t experience death until they see God&amp;quot;s kingdom realm manifest with power!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">After six days, Jesus took Peter and the two brothers, Jacob and John, and hiked up a high mountain to be alone. And Jesus&amp;quot; appearance was dramatically altered, for he was transfigured before their very eyes!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">His clothing sparkled and became glistening white&amp;ndash;whiter than any bleach in the world could make them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Then suddenly, right in front of them, Moses and Elijah appeared, and they spoke with Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Peter blurted out, &amp;apos;Good Teacher, this is so amazing to see the three of you together ! Why don&amp;quot;t we stay here and set up three shelters: one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">(For all of the disciples were in total fear, and Peter didn&amp;quot;t have a clue what to say.)</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Just then, a radiant cloud began to spread over them, enveloping them all. And God&amp;quot;s voice suddenly spoke from the cloud, saying, &amp;apos;This is my beloved Son and you need to always listen to him!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Then suddenly, as they looked around, they saw only Jesus with them, for Moses and Elijah had faded away.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">As they all hiked down the mountain together, Jesus ordered them, &amp;apos;Don&amp;quot;t tell anyone of what you just witnessed. Wait until the Son of Man is raised from the dead.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">So they kept it to themselves, puzzled over what Jesus meant about rising from the dead.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Then they asked him, &amp;apos;Why do the religious scholars insist that Elijah must come before the Messiah?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">He answered them, &amp;apos;They&amp;quot;re right. Elijah must come first to put everything in order. And what about all that is written about the Son of Man? It is true that he must endure many sufferings and be rejected.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">So Elijah has already appeared, just as it was prophesied, and they did to him whatever they pleased.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Now when they came down the mountain to the other nine disciples, they noticed a large crowd of people gathered around them, with the religious scholars arguing with them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">The crowd was astonished to see Jesus himself walking toward them, so they immediately ran to welcome him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">&amp;apos;What are you arguing about with the religious scholars?&amp;apos; he asked them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">A man spoke up out of the crowd. &amp;apos;Teacher,&amp;apos; he said, &amp;apos;I have a son possessed by a demon that makes him mute. I brought him here to you, Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Whenever the demon takes control of him, it knocks him down, and he foams at the mouth and gnashes his teeth, and his body becomes stiff as a board. I brought him to your disciples, hoping they could deliver him, but they were not able to do it.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Jesus said to the crowd, &amp;apos;Why are you such a faithless people? How much longer must I remain with you and put up with your unbelief? Now, bring the boy to me.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">So they brought him to Jesus. As soon as the demon saw him, it threw the boy into convulsions. He fell to the ground, rolling around and foaming at the mouth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Jesus turned to the father and asked, &amp;apos;How long has your son been tormented like this?&amp;apos; &amp;apos;Since childhood,&amp;apos; he replied.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">&amp;apos;It tries over and over to kill him by throwing him into fire or into the water. But please, if you&amp;quot;re able to do something, anything&amp;ndash;have compassion on us and help us!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">Jesus said to him, &amp;apos;What do you mean &amp;quot;if&amp;quot;? If you are able to believe, all things are possible to the believer.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">When he heard this, the boy&amp;quot;s father cried out with tears, saying, &amp;apos;I do believe, Lord; help my little faith!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">Now when Jesus saw that the crowd was quickly growing larger, he commanded the demon, saying, &amp;apos;Deaf and mute spirit, I command you to come out of him and never enter him again!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">The demon shrieked and threw the boy into terrible seizures and finally came out of him! As the boy lay there, looking like a corpse, everyone thought he was dead.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">But Jesus stooped down, gently took his hand, and raised him up to his feet, and he stood there completely set free!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">Afterwards, when Jesus arrived at the house, his disciples asked him in private, &amp;apos;Why couldn&amp;quot;t we cast out the demon?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">He answered them, &amp;apos;This type of powerful spirit can only be cast out by fasting and prayer.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">They went on from there and walked through the region of Galilee. Jesus didn&amp;quot;t want the people to know he was there, because he wanted to teach his disciples in private.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">He said to them, &amp;apos;The Son of Man is destined to be betrayed and turned over to those who will execute him. But after three days he will rise again.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">But the disciples didn&amp;quot;t have a clue what he meant and were too embarrassed to ask him to explain it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">Then they came to Capernaum. And as soon as Jesus was inside the house, he asked his disciples, &amp;apos;What were you arguing about on the way here?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">No one said a word, because they had been arguing about which one of them was the greatest.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">Jesus sat down, called the twelve disciples to come around him, and said to them, &amp;apos;If anyone wants to be first, he must be content to be last and become a servant to all.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">Then he had a child come and stand among them. He wrapped the child in his arms and said to them,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">&amp;apos;Whoever welcomes a little child in my name welcomes me. And whoever welcomes me welcomes not only me, but the one who sent me.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">John spoke up and said, &amp;apos;Teacher, we noticed someone was using your name to cast out demons, so we tried to stop him because he wasn&amp;quot;t one of our group.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">&amp;apos;Don&amp;quot;t stop him!&amp;apos; Jesus replied. &amp;apos;For the one who does miracles in the power of my name proves he is not my enemy.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">And whoever is not against us is for us.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">Listen to the truth that I speak: Whoever gives you a cup of water because you carry the name of Christ will never lose his reward.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">But if anyone abuses one of these little ones who believe in me, it would be better for him to have a heavy boulder tied around his neck and be thrown into the sea than to face the punishment he deserves!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43">&amp;apos;If your hand entices you to sin, let it go limp and useless! For it is better for you to enter into life maimed than to have your entire body thrown into hell, the place of unquenchable fire.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44">This is where the maggots never die and the fire never goes out.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45">And if your foot leads you into sin, cut it off! For it is better to enter life crawling than to have both feet and be flung into hell.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46">This is where the maggots never die and the fire never goes out.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="47">And if your eye causes you to sin, pluck it out! For it is better to enter into life with one eye than to be thrown into hell with two.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="48">This is where the maggots never die and the fire never goes out!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="49">&amp;apos;Everyone will pass through the fire and every sacrifice will be seasoned with salt.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="50">Salt is excellent for seasoning. But if salt becomes tasteless, how can its flavor ever be restored? Your lives, like salt, are to season and preserve. So don&amp;quot;t lose your flavor, and preserve the peace in your union with one another.&amp;apos;</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="10">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Then Jesus left the region and went into the district of Judea, across from the Jordan River, and again, massive crowds flocked to him, and Jesus, as was his custom, began to teach the people.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">At one point, some of the Pharisees came, seeking to entrap him with a question. &amp;apos;Tell us,&amp;apos; they asked, &amp;apos;is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">He answered them, &amp;apos;What did Moses command you?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">They replied, &amp;apos;Moses permitted us to write a certificate of separation that would be valid to complete a divorce.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Jesus said, &amp;apos;Yes, Moses wrote this exception for you because you are hardhearted.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">But from the beginning God created male and female.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">For this reason a man will leave his parents and be wedded to his wife.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">And the husband and wife will be joined as one flesh, and after that they no longer exist as two, but one flesh.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">So there you have it. What God has joined together, no one has the right to split apart.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Once indoors, his disciples asked him to explain it to them again.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">So he said to them, &amp;apos;Whoever divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery against her.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">And if the wife divorces her husband and marries another, she also commits adultery.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">The parents kept bringing their little children to Jesus so that he would lay his hands on them and bless them . But the disciples kept rebuking and scolding the people for doing it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">When Jesus saw what was happening, he became indignant with his disciples and said to them, &amp;apos;Let all the little children come to me and never hinder them! Don&amp;quot;t you know that God&amp;quot;s kingdom exists for such as these?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Listen to the truth I speak: Whoever does not open their arms to receive God&amp;quot;s kingdom like a teachable child will never enter it.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Then he embraced each child, and laying his hands on them, he lovingly blessed each one.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">As Jesus started on his way, a man came running up to him. Kneeling down in front of him, he cried out, &amp;apos;Good Teacher, what one thing am I required to do to gain eternal life?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Jesus responded, &amp;apos;Why do you call me good? Only God is truly good.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">You already know the commandments: &amp;quot;Do not murder, do not commit adultery, do not steal, do not give a false testimony, do not cheat, and honor your father and mother.&amp;quot; &amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">The man said to Jesus, &amp;apos;Teacher, I have carefully obeyed these laws since my youth.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Jesus fixed his gaze upon the man, with tender love, and said to him, &amp;apos;Yet there is still one thing in you lacking. Go, sell all that you have and give the money to the poor. Then all of your treasure will be in heaven. After you&amp;quot;ve done this, come back and walk with me.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Completely shocked by Jesus&amp;quot; answer, he turned and walked away very sad, for he was extremely rich.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">Jesus looked at the faces of his disciples and said, &amp;apos;How hard it is for the wealthy to enter into God&amp;quot;s kingdom realm.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">The disciples were startled when they heard this. But Jesus again said to them, &amp;apos;Children, it is next to impossible for those who trust in their riches to find their way into God&amp;quot;s kingdom.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">It is easier to stuff a rope through the eye of a needle than for a wealthy person to enter into God&amp;quot;s kingdom.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">But this left them all the more astonished, and they whispered to one another, &amp;apos;Then who could ever be saved?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">Jesus looked at them and replied, &amp;apos;With people it is impossible, but not with God&amp;ndash;God makes all things possible!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">Then Peter spoke up and said, &amp;apos;Can&amp;quot;t you see that we&amp;quot;ve left everything we had to cling to you?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">&amp;apos;Listen to my words,&amp;apos; Jesus said. &amp;apos;Anyone who leaves his home behind and chooses me over children, parents, family, and possessions, all for the sake of the gospel,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">it will come back to him a hundred times as much in this lifetime&amp;ndash;homes, family, mothers, brothers, sisters, children, possessions&amp;ndash;along with persecutions. And in the age to come, he will inherit eternal life.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">But many who are considered to be the most important now will be the least important then. And many who are viewed as the least important now will be considered the most important then.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">Jesus and his disciples were on the road that went up to Jerusalem, and Jesus was leading them forward. The disciples were filled with wonder and amazement at his bravery, but those following along with them were very afraid. As they approached the city, he took the Twelve aside privately and told them what was going to happen.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">&amp;apos;I want you to know that we are going to Jerusalem, where the Son of Man will be handed over to the ruling priests and religious scholars and they will condemn him to death and hand him over to the Romans.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">And they will mock him, spit in his face, torture him, and kill him, but three days later he will rise again.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">Jacob and John, sons of Zebedee, approached Jesus and said, &amp;apos;Teacher, will you do us a favor?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">&amp;apos;What is it?&amp;apos; he asked.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">&amp;apos;We want to sit next to you when you come into your glory,&amp;apos; they said, &amp;apos;one at your right hand and the other at your left.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">Jesus replied, &amp;apos;You don&amp;quot;t have a clue what you&amp;quot;re asking for! Are you prepared to drink from the cup of suffering that I am about to drink? And are you able to endure the baptism into death that I am about to experience?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">They replied, &amp;apos;Yes, we are able.&amp;apos; Jesus said to them, &amp;apos;You will certainly drink from the cup of my sufferings and be immersed into my death,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">but to have you sit in the position of highest honor is not mine to decide. It is reserved for those especially prepared to have it.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">Now the other ten disciples overheard this, and they became angry and began to criticize Jacob and John.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">Jesus gathered them all together and said to them, &amp;apos;Those recognized as rulers of the people and those who are in top leadership positions rule oppressively over their subjects, but this is not the example you are to follow.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43">You are to lead by a different model. If you want to be the greatest, then live as one called to serve others.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44">The path to promotion comes by having the heart of a bond-slave who serves everyone.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45">For even the Son of Man did not come expecting to be served by everyone, but to serve everyone, and to give his life as the ransom price for the salvation of many.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46">When Jesus and his disciples had passed through Jericho, a large crowd joined them. Upon leaving the village, they met a blind beggar sitting on the side of the road named Timai, the son of Timai.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="47">When he heard that Jesus from Nazareth was passing by, he began to shout &amp;apos;Jesus, son of David, have mercy on me now in my affliction. Heal me !&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="48">Those in the crowd were indignant and scolded him for making so much of a disturbance, but he kept shouting with all his might, &amp;apos;Son of David, have mercy on me now and heal me !&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="49">Jesus stopped and said, &amp;apos;Call him here.&amp;apos; So they went to the blind man and said, &amp;apos;Have courage! Get up! Jesus is calling for you!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="50">So he threw off his beggars&amp;quot; cloak, jumped up, and made his way to Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="51">Jesus said to him, &amp;apos;What do you want me to do for you?&amp;apos; The man replied, &amp;apos;My Master, please, let me see again!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="52">Jesus responded, &amp;apos;Your faith heals you. Go in peace, with your sight restored.&amp;apos; All at once, the man&amp;quot;s eyes opened and he could see again, and he began at once to follow Jesus, walking down the road with him.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="11">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Now, as they were approaching Jerusalem, they arrived at the place of the stables near Bethany on the Mount of Olives. Jesus sent two of his disciples ahead</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">and said to them, &amp;apos;As soon as you enter the village ahead, you will find a donkey&amp;quot;s colt tied there that has never been ridden. Untie it and bring it to me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">And if anyone asks, &amp;quot;Why are you taking it?&amp;quot; tell them, &amp;quot;The master needs it and will send it back to you soon.&amp;quot; &amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">So they went and found the colt outside in the street, tied to a gate. When they started to untie it,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">some people standing there said to them, &amp;apos;Why are you untying that colt?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">They answered just as Jesus had told them: &amp;apos;The master needs it, and he will send it back to you soon.&amp;apos; So the bystanders let them go.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">The disciples brought the colt to Jesus and piled their cloaks and prayer shawls on the young donkey, and Jesus rode upon it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Many people carpeted the road in front of him with their cloaks and prayer shawls , while others gathered palm branches and spread them before him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Jesus rode in the center of the procession, with crowds going before him and behind him. They all shouted in celebration, &amp;apos;Bring the victory! We welcome the one coming with blessings sent from the Lord Yahweh !</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Blessings rest on this kingdom he ushers in&amp;ndash;the kingdom of our father David! Bring us the victory in the highest realms of heaven !&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Jesus rode through the gates of Jerusalem and up to the temple. After looking around at everything, he left for Bethany with the Twelve to spend the night, for it was already late in the day.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">The next day, as he left Bethany, Jesus was feeling hungry.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">He noticed a leafy fig tree in the distance, so he walked over to see if there was any fruit on it, but there was none&amp;ndash;only leaves (for it wasn&amp;quot;t yet the season for bearing figs).</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Jesus spoke to the fig tree, saying, &amp;apos;No one will ever eat fruit from you again!&amp;apos; And the disciples overheard him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">When they came into Jerusalem, Jesus went directly into the temple area and overturned all the tables and benches of the merchants who were doing business there. One by one he drove them all out of the temple courts, and they scattered away, including the money changers and those selling doves.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">And he would not allow them to use the temple courts as a thoroughfare for carrying their merchandise and their furniture.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Then he began to teach the people, saying, &amp;apos;Does not the Scripture say, &amp;quot;My house will be a house of prayer for all the world to share&amp;quot;? But you have made it a hangout of thieves!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">When the chief priests and religious scholars heard this, they began to hatch a plot as to how they could eliminate Jesus. But they feared him and his influence, because the entire crowd was totally captivated by his teaching.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">So he and his disciples spent the nights outside the city.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">In the morning, they passed by the fig tree that Jesus spoke to and it was completely withered from the roots up.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Peter remembered and said to him, &amp;apos;Teacher, look! That&amp;quot;s the fig tree you cursed. It&amp;quot;s now all shriveled up and dead.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Jesus replied, &amp;apos;Let the faith of God be in you!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">Listen to the truth I speak to you: Whoever says to this mountain with great faith and does not doubt, &amp;quot;Mountain, be lifted up and thrown into the midst of the sea,&amp;quot; and believes that what he says will happen, it will be done.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">This is the reason I urge you to boldly believe for whatever you ask for in prayer&amp;ndash;be convinced that you have received it and it will be yours.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">And whenever you stand praying, if you find that you carry something in your heart against another person, release him and forgive him so that your Father in heaven will also release you and forgive you of your faults.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">But if you will not release forgiveness, don&amp;quot;t expect your Father in heaven to release you from your misdeeds.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">They came again into Jerusalem, and while Jesus was walking in the temple courts, the Jewish rulers&amp;ndash;the chief priest, certain religious scholars, and the elders&amp;ndash;approached him. They came up to him</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">and asked, &amp;apos;What right do you have to say and do these things? Who gave you the authority to do all this?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">Jesus replied, &amp;apos;I too have a question to ask you. If you can answer this question, then I will tell you by what power I do all these things.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">Where did John&amp;quot;s authority to immerse come from? Was it from heaven or from people? Answer me now.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">They stepped away and debated among themselves, saying, &amp;apos;How should we answer this? If we say, &amp;quot;from heaven,&amp;quot; he will say to us, &amp;quot;Then why didn&amp;quot;t you respond to John and believe what he said?&amp;quot;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">But if we say, &amp;quot;from the people,&amp;quot; we fear the crowds, for they&amp;quot;re convinced that John was God&amp;quot;s prophet.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">So they finally answered, &amp;apos;We don&amp;quot;t know.&amp;apos; &amp;apos;Then neither will I tell you where my power comes from to do these things,&amp;apos; Jesus replied.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="12">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Then Jesus began to speak to them in parables: &amp;apos;There once was a man who planted a vineyard and put a secure fence around it. He dug a pit for its winepress and erected a watch tower. Then he leased it to tenant-farmers and traveled abroad.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">When the time of harvest came, he sent one of his servants to the tenants to collect the landowners&amp;quot; share of the harvest.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">But the tenants seized him and beat him and sent him back empty-handed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">So the owner sent another servant to them. And that one they shamefully humiliated and beat over the head.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">So he sent another servant, and they brutally killed him. Many more servants were sent, and they were all severely beaten or killed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">The owner had only one person left to send&amp;ndash;his only son, whom he dearly loved. So he sent him to them, saying, &amp;quot;Surely they will restrain themselves and respect my son.&amp;quot;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">But the tenants saw their chance and said to one another, &amp;quot;This is the heir. Come! Let&amp;quot;s kill him, and then we&amp;quot;ll inherit it all!&amp;quot;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">So they violently seized him, killed him, and threw his body over the fence!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">So what do you think the owner of the vineyard will do? He will come and put to death those tenants and give his vineyard to others.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Haven&amp;quot;t you read what the psalmist said? The stone the builders examined and rejected has become the cornerstone, &amp;apos;Now, tell me,&amp;apos; Jesus said, &amp;apos;whose head is on this coin and whose inscription is stamped on it?&amp;apos; Yahweh said to my Lord, &amp;quot;Sit near me in the place of authority The large crowd listened to him with delight. the most important stone of all? and he is wonderful for our eyes to behold!&amp;apos; &amp;apos;Caesar&amp;quot;s,&amp;apos; they replied. until I subdue all your enemies under Your feet.&amp;quot;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">This was the Lord&amp;quot;s plan&amp;ndash;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Now, the chief priests, religious scholars, and leaders realized that Jesus&amp;quot; parable was aimed at them. They had hoped to arrest him then and there, but they feared the reaction of the crowd, so they left him alone and went away.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Then they sent a delegation of Pharisees, together with some staunch supporters of Herod, to entrap Jesus with his own words.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">So they approached him and said, &amp;apos;Teacher, we know that you&amp;quot;re an honest man of integrity and you teach us the truth of God&amp;quot;s ways. We can clearly see that you&amp;quot;re not one who speaks only to win the people&amp;quot;s favor, because you speak the truth without regard to the consequences. So tell us, then, what you think. Is it proper for us to pay taxes to Caesar or not?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Jesus saw through their hypocrisy and said to them, &amp;apos;Why are you testing me? Show me one of the Roman coins.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">They brought him a silver coin used to pay the tax.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Jesus said, &amp;apos; Precisely. The coin bears the image of the emperor Caesar , so you should pay the emperor his portion. But because you bear the image of God, you must give to God all that belongs to him.&amp;apos; And they were utterly stunned by Jesus&amp;quot; words.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Some of the Sadducees, a religious group that denied there was a resurrection of the dead, came to ask Jesus this question:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">&amp;apos;Teacher, the law of Moses teaches that if a man dies before he has children, his brother should marry the widow and raise up children for his brother&amp;quot;s family line.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Now, there was a family with seven brothers. The oldest got married but soon died, and he had no children.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">The second brother married his oldest brother&amp;quot;s widow, and he also died without any children, and the third also.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">This repeated down to the seventh brother, none of whom had children. Finally, the woman died.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">So here&amp;quot;s our dilemma: Which of the seven brothers will be the woman&amp;quot;s husband when she&amp;quot;s resurrected from the dead, since they all were once married to her?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">Jesus answered them, &amp;apos;You are mistaken because your hearts are not filled with the revelation of the Scriptures or the power of God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">For when they rise from the dead, men and women will not marry, just like the angels of heaven don&amp;quot;t marry.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">Now, concerning the resurrection, haven&amp;quot;t you read in the Torah what God said to Moses at the burning bush? &amp;quot;I AM the living God, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob&amp;quot;?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">God is not God of the dead, but of the living, and you are all badly mistaken!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">Now a certain religious scholar overheard them debating. When he saw how beautifully Jesus answered all their questions, he posed one of his own, and asked him, &amp;apos;Teacher, which commandment is the greatest of all?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">Jesus answered him, &amp;apos;The most important of all the commandments is this: &amp;quot;The Lord Yahweh , our God, is one!&amp;quot;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">You are to love the Lord Yahweh , your God, with a passionate heart, from the depths of your soul, with your every thought, and with all your strength. This is the great and supreme commandment.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">And the second is this: &amp;quot;You must love your neighbor in the same way you love yourself.&amp;quot; You will never find a greater commandment than these.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">The religious scholar replied, &amp;apos;Yes, that&amp;quot;s true, Teacher. You spoke beautifully when you said that God is one, and there is no one else besides him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">And there is something more important to God than all the sacrifices and burnt offerings: it&amp;quot;s the commandment to constantly love God with every passion of your heart, with your every thought, and with all your strength&amp;ndash;and to love your neighbor in the same way as you love yourself.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">When Jesus noticed how thoughtfully and sincerely the man answered, he said to him, &amp;apos;You&amp;quot;re not far from the reality of God&amp;quot;s kingdom.&amp;apos; After that, no one dared to question him again.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">While Jesus was teaching in the courts of the temple, he posed a question to those listening: &amp;apos;Why do the religious scholars say that the Messiah is David&amp;quot;s son?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">Yet it was David, inspired by the Holy Spirit, who sang:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">Since David calls him Lord, how can he be his son?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">Jesus also taught the people, &amp;apos;Beware of the religious scholars. They love to parade around in their clergy robes and be greeted with respect on the street.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">They crave to be made the leaders of synagogue councils, and they push their way to the head table at banquets.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">For appearance&amp;quot;s sake, they will pray long religious prayers at the homes of widows for an offering, cheating them out of their very livelihood. Beware of them all, for they will one day be stripped of honor, and the judgment they receive will be severe.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">Then he sat down near the offering box, watching all the people dropping in their coins. Many of the rich would put in very large sums,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">but a destitute widow walked up and dropped in two small copper coins, worth less than a penny.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43">Jesus called his disciples to gather around and then said to them, &amp;apos;I tell you the truth, this poor widow has given a larger offering than any of the wealthy.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44">For the rich only gave out of their surplus, but she sacrificed out of her poverty and gave to God all that she had to live on, which was everything she had.&amp;apos;</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="13">
			<VERS vnumber="1">As Jesus was leaving the temple courts, one of his disciples came to him and said, &amp;apos;Teacher, look at these magnificent buildings! And what tremendous stones were used to build all this!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Jesus turned to them and said, &amp;apos;Take a good look at all these enormous buildings, for I&amp;quot;m telling you, there will not be one stone left upon another. It will all be leveled!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Later, while Jesus was sitting on the Mount of Olives, overlooking the temple, his disciples, Peter, Jacob, John, and Andrew, came to him privately where he was sitting and said,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">&amp;apos;Tell us, when will these things happen? And what supernatural sign should we expect to signal your coming and the completion of this age?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Jesus answered, &amp;apos;At that time deception will run rampant. So beware that you&amp;quot;re not fooled!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">For many will appear on the scene claiming my authority or saying about themselves, &amp;quot;I am God&amp;quot;s Anointed,&amp;quot; and they will lead many astray.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">You will hear rumors of wars nearby, with more rumors of wars to come. Make sure that you are not thrown into a panic or give in to your fears, for these things are destined to happen. Prepare for it, but still the end is not yet.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">For nations will go to war against each other and kingdoms will clash with kingdoms. And there will be terrible earthquakes in place after place&amp;ndash;seismic events of epic proportion. And there will be famines and riots. This is how the first contractions and birth pains of the new age will begin.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">&amp;apos;Be on your guard! For they will hand you over to the ruling councils, and you will be beaten in public gatherings. And you will stand trial before kings and high-ranking governmental leaders as an opportunity to testify to them on my behalf.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">But prior to the end of the age, the hope of the gospel must first be preached to all nations.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">&amp;apos;So when they put you under arrest and hand you over for trial, don&amp;quot;t even give one thought about what you will say. Simply speak what the Holy Spirit gives you at that very moment. And realize that it won&amp;quot;t be you speaking but the Holy Spirit speaking through you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Brothers will betray each other unto death&amp;ndash;even a father his child. Children will rise up to take a stand against their parents and have them put to death.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Expect to be hated by all because of your allegiance to my name. But determine to be faithful to the end and you will be saved.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">&amp;apos;When you witness what Daniel prophesied, &amp;quot;the disgusting destroyer,&amp;quot; standing where it must not be [Let the reader learn what it means], then those in the land of Judah must escape to higher ground.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">On that day, if you happen to be outside, don&amp;quot;t go back inside to gather your belongings.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">And if you&amp;quot;re working out in the field, don&amp;quot;t run back home to get a coat.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">It will be especially hard for pregnant women and for those nursing their babies when those days come.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">So pray that your escape will not be during the winter months.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">For this will be a time of great misery beyond the magnitude of anything the world has ever seen from the beginning of time or ever will see.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Unless God limits those days, no one would escape. But because of his love for his chosen ones, he will shorten that time of trouble.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">&amp;apos;And if you hear reports from people, saying, &amp;quot;Look, the Messiah is over here,&amp;quot; or, &amp;quot;The Messiah is over there!&amp;quot; don&amp;quot;t believe it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">For there will be imposters falsely claiming to be God&amp;quot;s &amp;quot;Anointed One.&amp;quot; And false prophets will arise to perform miracle signs, and if it were possible, they would cause God&amp;quot;s chosen ones to wander off the right track.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">Be alert, for I prophesy all this will happen!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">&amp;apos;This is what will take place after that suffering: The sun will be darkened and the moon will reflect no light.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">The stars will be falling from the sky and all the cosmic powers will be shaken.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">&amp;apos;Then they will see the Son of Man appearing in the midst of clouds and revealed with mighty power and great glory.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">At that time he will send his messengers to gather together his beloved chosen ones from every direction&amp;ndash;from the ends of the earth to the ends of heaven!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">&amp;apos;Now, learn the lesson from the parable of the fig tree. When spring arrives, and it sends out its tender branches and sprouts leaves, you know that summer is near.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">So also, when you observe all these things progressively taking place, you will know that he is near, even at the door!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">I assure you, this family will not pass away until all I have spoken comes to pass.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">The earth and sky will wear out and fade away before one word I speak loses its power or fails to accomplish its purpose.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">&amp;apos;Concerning that day and exact hour, no one knows when it will arrive, not the angels of heaven, not even the Son&amp;ndash;only the Father knows.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">This is why you must be waiting, watching and praying, because no one knows when that season of time will come.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">&amp;apos;For those days can be compared to a man who was about to leave on a journey, but before leaving he placed his servants in charge and gave each one work to do while he was away. Then he commanded the watchman to be on guard at all times.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">So I say to you, keep awake and alert&amp;ndash;for you have no idea when the master of the house will return; in the evening, at midnight, at four o&amp;quot;clock in the morning, or at dawn.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">Be alert, for he&amp;quot;s coming suddenly and may find you sleeping!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">And what I say to the four of you, I say to everyone&amp;ndash;be awake at all times!&amp;apos;</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="14">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Two days before the Passover and the Feast of Unleavened Bread, the leading priests and religious scholars were committed to finding a way to secretly arrest Jesus and have him executed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">They agreed that their plot could not succeed if they carried it out during the days of the feast, for they said, &amp;apos;There could be a riot among the people.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Now Jesus was in Bethany, in the home of Simon, a man Jesus had healed of leprosy. And as he was reclining at the table, a woman came into the house, with an alabaster flask filled with the highest quality of fragrant and expensive oil. She came to Jesus, and with a gesture of extreme devotion , she broke the flask and poured out the precious oil over his head.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">But some were highly indignant when they saw this, and they complained to one another, saying, &amp;apos;What a total waste!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">It could have been sold for a great sum, and the money could have benefited the poor.&amp;apos; So they scolded her harshly.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Jesus said to them, &amp;apos;Leave her alone! Why are you so critical of this woman? She has honored me with this beautiful act of kindness.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">You will always have the poor, whom you can help whenever you want, but you will not always have me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">When she poured the fragrant oil over me, she was preparing my body in advance of my burial. She has done all that she could to honor me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">I promise you that as this wonderful gospel spreads all over the world, the story of her lavish devotion to me will be mentioned in memory of her.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">One of the twelve apostles, Judas Iscariot, went to the leading priests to inform them of his willingness to betray Jesus into their hands.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">They were delighted to hear this and agreed to pay him for it. So immediately Judas began to look for the right opportunity to betray him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">On the first day of Unleavened Bread, when the Passover Lamb is sacrificed, Jesus&amp;quot; disciples asked him, &amp;apos;Where would you like us to prepare the Passover meal for you?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">So he sent two of his disciples ahead into Jerusalem with these instructions: &amp;apos;Make your way into the city and watch for a man carrying a pitcher of water. Follow him,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">and say to the owner of whatever house he enters, &amp;quot;The Teacher wants to ask you: &amp;apos;Do you have my room ready where I can eat the Passover meal with my disciples?&amp;apos; &amp;quot;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">And he will show you a large upstairs room ready and with a table set. Make preparations for us there.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">So they went into the city and found everything to be exactly like Jesus had prophesied, and they prepared for him the Passover meal.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">And when evening came, he entered the house and went upstairs with his twelve disciples.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Over dinner, while they were reclining around the table, Jesus said, &amp;apos;Listen to the truth: One of you eating here with me is about to betray me.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Feeling deeply troubled by these words, one after another asked him, &amp;apos;Is it I?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">He answered, &amp;apos;It is one of you twelve who has shared meals with me as an intimate friend.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">All that was prophesied of me, the Son of Man, is destined to soon take place, but it will be disastrous for the one who betrays the Son of Man. It would be far better for him if he had never been born!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">As they were dining, Jesus took the bread and blessed it, and broke it, and gave it to his disciples. He said to them, &amp;apos;Receive this; it is my body.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">Then taking the cup of wine and giving thanks to the Father, he declared the new covenant with them. And as each one drank from the cup,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">he said to them, &amp;apos;This is my blood, which seals the new covenant poured out for many.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">I tell you the truth, I will not drink again of the fruit of the vine until the day comes when we drink it together in the kingdom feast of my Father.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">Then they sang a psalm and afterwards left for the Mount of Olives.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">Jesus said to them, &amp;apos;You will all fall away and desert me. This will fulfill the prophecy of the Scripture that says: I will strike down the shepherd &amp;apos;He&amp;quot;s guilty and deserves the death penalty!&amp;apos; they all answered. and all the sheep will scatter.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">&amp;apos;But after I am risen, I will go ahead of you to Galilee.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">Then Peter spoke up and said, &amp;apos;Even if all the rest lose their faith and fall away, I will still be beside you!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">Jesus said, &amp;apos;Mark my words, Peter. This very night, before the rooster crows twice a few hours from now, you will deny that you know me three times.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">But Peter was insistent and replied emphatically, &amp;apos;I will absolutely not! Under no circumstances will I ever deny you&amp;ndash;even if I have to die with you!&amp;apos; And all the others repeated the same thing.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">Then Jesus led his disciples to an orchard called &amp;apos;The Oil Press.&amp;apos; He told them, &amp;apos;Sit here while I pray awhile.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">He took Peter, Jacob, and John with him. An intense feeling of great horror plunged his soul into deep sorrow.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">And he said to them, &amp;apos;My heart is overwhelmed with anguish and crushed with grief. It feels as though I&amp;quot;m dying. Stay here and keep watch with me.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">He walked a short distance away, and being overcome with grief, he threw himself facedown on the ground. He prayed that if it were possible, he would not have to experience this hour of suffering .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">He prayed, &amp;apos;Abba, my Father, all things are possible for you. Please&amp;ndash;remove this cup of suffering! Yet what I want is not important, for I only desire to fulfill your plan for me.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">Then he came back to his three disciples and found them all sound asleep. He awakened Peter and said to him, &amp;apos;Simon, are you asleep? Do you lack the strength to stay awake with me for even just an hour?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">Keep alert and pray that you&amp;quot;ll be spared from this time of testing. For your spirit is eager enough, but your humanity is feeble.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">Then he left them a second time and went to pray the same thing.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">Afterward, he came back to the disciples and found them sound asleep, for they couldn&amp;quot;t keep their eyes open and they didn&amp;quot;t know what to say to him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">After praying for the third time, he returned to his disciples and awoke them again, saying, &amp;apos;Do you plan on sleeping and resting indefinitely? That&amp;quot;s enough sleep! The end has come and the hour has arrived for the Son of Man to be handed over to the authority of sinful men.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">Get up and let&amp;quot;s go. Don&amp;quot;t you see? My betrayer draws near.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43">At that moment Judas, one of the Twelve, arrived, along with a large crowd of men armed with swords and clubs. They had been sent to arrest Jesus by order of the ruling priests, the religious scholars, and the Jewish leaders.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44">Now, Judas, the traitor, had arranged to give them a signal that would identify Jesus, for he had told them, &amp;apos;Jesus is the man I will kiss. So arrest him and take him away.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45">Judas quickly stepped up to Jesus and said, &amp;apos;Rabbi, my teacher!&amp;apos; and he kissed him on both cheeks.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46">Then the armed men seized Jesus to arrest him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="47">One of the disciples pulled out a sword and swung it at the servant of Caiaphas , the high priest, slashing off his ear.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="48">Jesus said to the mob, &amp;apos;Why would you arrest me with swords and clubs as though I were an outlaw?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="49">Day after day I sat with you in the temple courts, teaching the people, yet you didn&amp;quot;t arrest me then. But all of this fulfills the prophecies of the Scriptures.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="50">At that point all of his disciples ran away and abandoned him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="51">There was a young man there following Jesus, wearing only a linen sheet wrapped around him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="52">They tried to arrest him also, but he slipped from their grasp and ran off naked, leaving his linen cloth in their hands.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="53">Those who arrested Jesus led him away to Caiaphas, the high priest, to a meeting where the religious scholars and Jewish leaders were assembled.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="54">Now, Peter had followed him from a distance all the way to the chief priest&amp;quot;s courtyard. He sat with the guards and was warming himself by the fire.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="55">The chief priests and the Jewish council of leaders were doing their best to find false charges that they could bring against Jesus and condemn him to death, but they could not find any.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="56">Many false witnesses came forward, but the evidence could not be corroborated.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="57">Some came forward and testified against him, saying,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="58">&amp;apos;We heard him say, &amp;quot;I can destroy this temple made with hands and then build another one again in three days not made with hands!&amp;quot; &amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="59">Yet even on this point the witnesses did not agree.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="60">Finally, the chief priest stood up in the middle of them and said to Jesus, &amp;apos;Have you nothing to say about these allegations? Is what they&amp;quot;re saying about you true?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="61">But Jesus remained silent before them and did not answer. So the chief priest said to him, &amp;apos;Are you the anointed Messiah, the Son of the Blessed God?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="62">Jesus answered him, &amp;apos;I am. And more than that, you are about to see the Son of Man seated at the right hand of the Almighty and coming in the heavenly clouds!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="63">Then, as an act of outrage , the high priest tore his robe and shouted, &amp;apos;No more witnesses are needed,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="64">for you&amp;quot;ve heard this grievous blasphemy.&amp;apos; Turning to the council he said , &amp;apos;Now, what is your verdict?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="65">Then they spat on his face and blindfolded him. Others struck him over and over with their fists and taunted him by saying, &amp;apos;Prophesy to us! Tell us which one of us is about to hit you next? &amp;apos; And the guards took him and beat him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="66">Meanwhile, Peter was sitting below in the courtyard when a girl, a servant of the high priest, came near the fire.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="67">When she saw Peter there warming himself, she said to him, &amp;apos;I recognize you. You were with that Nazarene, Jesus.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="68">But Peter denied it, saying, &amp;apos;I don&amp;quot;t have a clue what you&amp;quot;re talking about.&amp;apos; Then he went out to the gateway of the courtyard and the rooster crowed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="69">When the servant girl noticed him, she said to all the bystanders, &amp;apos;I know this man is one of his followers!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="70">Once again, Peter denied it. A short time later, the bystanders said to him, &amp;apos;You must be one of them. You&amp;quot;re a Galilean, like he is, for your accent proves it!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="71">Peter cursed and said, &amp;apos;I tell you, I don&amp;quot;t know this man you&amp;quot;re talking about!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="72">At the same moment Peter spoke those words, the sound of a rooster crowing pierced the night for the second time. And Peter remembered the words Jesus had spoken to him earlier: &amp;apos;Before the rooster crows twice, you will deny me three times.&amp;apos; With his heart shattered , Peter broke down and sobbed with bitter tears.</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="15">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Before dawn that morning, the ruling priests, elders, religious scholars, and the entire Jewish council set in motion their plan against Jesus. They bound him in chains, took him away, and handed him over to Pilate.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">As Jesus stood in front of the Roman governor , Pilate asked him, &amp;apos;So, are you really the king of the Jews?&amp;apos; Jesus answered, &amp;apos;You have just spoken it.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Then the ruling priests, over and over, made bitter accusations against him, but he remained silent.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">So Pilate questioned him again. &amp;apos;Have you nothing to say? Don&amp;quot;t you hear these many allegations they&amp;quot;re making against you?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">But Jesus offered no defense to any of the charges, much to the astonishment of Pilate.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Every year at Passover, it was the custom of the governor to pardon a prisoner and release him to the people&amp;ndash;anyone they wanted.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Now, Pilate was holding in custody a notorious criminal named Barabbas, one of the assassins who had committed murder in an uprising.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">The crowds gathered in front of Pilate&amp;quot;s judgment bench and asked him to release a prisoner to them, as was his custom.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">So he asked them, &amp;apos;Do you want me to release to you the king of the Jews?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">(Pilate was fully aware that the religious leaders had handed Jesus over to him because of spite and envy.)</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">But the ruling priests stirred up the crowd to incite them to ask for Barabbas instead.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">So Pilate asked them, &amp;apos;What do you want me to do with this one you call the king of the Jews?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">They all shouted back, &amp;apos;Crucify him!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">&amp;apos;Why?&amp;apos; Pilate asked. &amp;apos;What evil thing has he done wrong to deserve that?&amp;apos; But they kept shouting out with a deafening roar, &amp;apos;Crucify him at once!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Because he wanted to please the people, Pilate released Barabbas to them. After he had Jesus severely beaten with a whip made of leather straps and embedded with metal , he sentenced him to be crucified.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">The soldiers took Jesus into the headquarters of the governor&amp;quot;s compound and summoned a military unit of nearly six hundred men.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">They placed a purple robe on him to make fun of him . Then they braided a victor&amp;quot;s crown, a wreath made of thorns, and set it on his head.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">And with a mock salute they repeatedly cried out, &amp;apos;Hail, your majesty, king of the Jews!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">They spit in his face and hit him repeatedly on his head with a reed staff, driving the crown of thorns deep into his brow. They knelt down before him in mockery, pretending to pay him homage.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">When they finished ridiculing him, they took off the purple robe, put his own clothes back on him, and led him away to be crucified.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">As they came out of the city, they stopped an African man named Simon, a native of Libya. He was passing by, just coming in from the countryside with his two sons, Alexander and Rufus, and the soldiers forced him to carry the heavy crossbeam for Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">They brought Jesus to the execution site called Golgotha, which means &amp;apos;Skull Hill.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">There they offered him a mild painkiller, a drink of wine mixed with gall, but he refused to drink it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">They nailed his hands and feet to the cross. The soldiers divided his clothing among themselves by rolling dice to see who would win them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">It was nine o&amp;quot;clock in the morning when they finally crucified him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">Above his head they placed a sign with the inscription of the charge against him, which read, &amp;apos;This is the King of the Jews.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">Two criminals were also crucified with Jesus, one on each side of him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">This fulfilled the Scripture that says: He was considered to be a criminal.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">Those who passed by shook their heads and spitefully ridiculed him, saying, &amp;apos;Aha! You boasted that you could destroy the temple and rebuild it in three days.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">Why don&amp;quot;t you save yourself now? Just come down from the cross!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">Even the ruling priests and the religious scholars joined in the mockery and kept laughing among themselves, saying, &amp;apos;He saved others, but he can&amp;quot;t even save himself! Israel&amp;quot;s king, is he?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">Let the &amp;quot;Messiah,&amp;quot; the &amp;quot;king of Israel,&amp;quot; pull out the nails and come down from the cross right now. We&amp;quot;ll believe it when we see it!&amp;apos; Even the two criminals who were crucified with Jesus began to taunt him, hurling insults on him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">For three hours, beginning at noon, darkness came over the earth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">About three o&amp;quot;clock, Jesus shouted with a mighty voice in Aramaic, &amp;apos;Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani?&amp;apos; &amp;ndash;that is, &amp;apos;My God, My God, why have you turned your back on me?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">Some who were standing near the cross misunderstood and said, &amp;apos;Listen! He&amp;quot;s calling for Elijah.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">One bystander ran and got a sponge, soaked it with sour wine, then put it on a stick and held it up for Jesus to drink. But the rest said, &amp;apos;Leave him alone! Let&amp;quot;s see if Elijah comes to rescue him.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">Just then Jesus passionately cried out with a loud voice and breathed his last.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">At that moment the veil in the Holy of Holies was torn in two from the top to the bottom.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">When the Roman military officer who was standing right in front of Jesus saw how he died, he said, &amp;apos;There is no doubt this man was the Son of God!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">Evening was fast approaching, and it was a preparation day before a Sabbath.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43">So a prominent Jewish leader named Joseph, from the village of Ramah, courageously went to see Pilate and begged to have custody of the body of Jesus. Joseph was a highly regarded member of the Jewish council and a follower of Jesus who was eagerly awaiting the kingdom of God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44">Pilate was amazed to hear that Jesus was already dead, so he summoned the Roman officer, who confirmed it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45">After it was confirmed, Pilate consented to give the corpse to Joseph.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46">Joseph purchased a shroud of fine linen and took the body down from the cross. Then he wrapped it in the linen shroud and placed it in a tomb quarried from out of the rock. Then they rolled a large stone over the entrance to seal the tomb.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="47">Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joseph were there and saw exactly where they laid the body of Jesus.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="16">
			<VERS vnumber="3">And they had been asking one another, &amp;apos;Who can roll away the heavy stone for us from the entrance of the tomb?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">But when they arrived, they discovered that the very large stone was already rolled away!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">And as they stepped into the tomb, they saw a young man sitting on the right, dressed in a long white robe. The women were startled and amazed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">But the angel said to them, &amp;apos;Don&amp;quot;t be afraid. I know that you&amp;quot;re here looking for Jesus of Nazareth, who was crucified. He isn&amp;quot;t here&amp;ndash;he has risen victoriously ! Look! See the place where they laid him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Run and tell his disciples, even Peter, that he is risen. He has gone ahead of you into Galilee and you will see him there, just like he told you.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">They staggered out of the tomb, awestruck, with their minds swirling. They ran to tell the disciples, but they were so afraid and amazed, they said nothing to anyone.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Early on the first day of the week, after rising from the dead, Jesus appeared to Mary Magdalene, from whom he had cast out seven demons.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">After she had seen Jesus, she ran to tell his disciples, who were all emotionally devastated and weeping.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Excitedly, Mary told them, &amp;apos;He&amp;quot;s alive and I&amp;quot;ve seen him!&amp;apos; But even after hearing this, they didn&amp;quot;t believe her.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">After this, Jesus appeared to two of the disciples, who were on their way to another village, appearing in a form they did not recognize.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">They went back to Jerusalem to tell the rest of the disciples, but they didn&amp;quot;t believe it was true.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Then Jesus appeared before the eleven apostles as they were eating a meal. He corrected them for having such hard, unbelieving hearts because they did not believe those who saw him after his resurrection.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">And he said to them, &amp;apos;As you go into all the world, preach openly the wonderful news of the gospel to the entire human race!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Whoever believes the good news and is baptized will be saved, and whoever does not believe the good news will be condemned.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">And these miracle signs will accompany those who believe: They will drive out demons in the power of my name. They will speak in tongues.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">They will be supernaturally protected from snakes and from drinking anything poisonous. And they will lay hands on the sick and heal them.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">After saying these things, Jesus was lifted up into heaven and sat down at the place of honor at the right hand of God!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">And the apostles went out announcing the good news everywhere, as the Lord himself consistently worked with them, validating the message they preached with miracle-signs that accompanied them!</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="1">
			<VERS vnumber="5">During the reign of King Herod the Great of Judea, there was a Jewish priest named Zechariah who served in the temple as part of the priestly order of Abijah. His wife, Elizabeth, was also from a family of priests, and was a descendant of Aaron.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">They were both righteous before God, living virtuously and following the commandments of the Lord blamelessly.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">But they were childless since Elizabeth was barren, and now they both were quite old.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">A large crowd of worshipers had gathered to pray outside the temple at the hour when incense was being offered.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">All at once an angel of the Lord appeared to him, standing just to the right of the altar of incense.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Zechariah was startled and overwhelmed with fear.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">But the angel reassured him, saying, &amp;apos;Don&amp;quot;t be afraid, Zechariah! God is showing grace to you . For I have come to tell you that your prayer for a child has been answered. Your wife, Elizabeth, will bear you a son and you are to name him John.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">His birth will bring you much joy and gladness. Many will rejoice because of him,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">and he will be one of the great ones in the sight of God. He will drink no wine or strong drink, but he will be filled with the Holy Spirit even while still in his mother&amp;quot;s womb.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">And he will persuade many in Israel to convert and turn back to the Lord their God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">He will go before the Lord as a forerunner, with the same power and anointing as Elijah the prophet. He will be instrumental in turning the hearts of the fathers in tenderness back to their children and the hearts of the disobedient back to the wisdom of their righteous fathers. And he will prepare a united people who are ready for the Lord&amp;quot;s appearing.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Zechariah asked the angel, &amp;apos;How do you expect me to believe this? I&amp;quot;m an old man and my wife is too old to give me a child. What sign can you give me to prove this will happen? &amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Then the angel said, &amp;apos;I am Gabriel. I stand beside God himself. He has sent me to announce to you this good news.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">But now, since you did not believe my words, you will be stricken silent and unable to speak until the day my words have been fulfilled at their appointed time and a child is born to you. That will be your sign!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Meanwhile, the crowds outside kept expecting him to come out. They were amazed over Zechariah&amp;quot;s delay, wondering what could have happened inside the sanctuary.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">When he finally did come out, he tried to talk, but he couldn&amp;quot;t speak a word, and they realized from his gestures that he had seen a vision while in the Holy Place.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">He remained mute as he finished his days of priestly ministry in the temple and then went back to his own home.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">Soon afterward his wife, Elizabeth, became pregnant and went into seclusion for the next five months.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">With joy she exclaimed, &amp;apos;See how kind it is of God to gaze upon me and take away the disgrace of my barrenness!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">Gabriel appeared to her and said, &amp;apos;Rejoice, beloved young woman, for the Lord is with you and you are anointed with great favor.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">Mary was deeply troubled over the words of the angel and bewildered over what this may mean for her.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">But the angel reassured her, saying, &amp;apos;Do not yield to your fear, Mary, for the Lord has found delight in you and has chosen to surprise you with a wonderful gift.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">You will become pregnant with a baby boy, and you are to name him Jesus.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="34">Mary said, &amp;apos;But how could this happen? I am still a virgin!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">Gabriel answered, &amp;apos;The Spirit of Holiness will fall upon you and almighty God will spread his shadow of power over you in a cloud of glory! This is why the child born to you will be holy, and he will be called the Son of God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">What&amp;quot;s more, your aged aunt, Elizabeth, has also become pregnant with a son. The &amp;quot;barren one&amp;quot; is now in her sixth month.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">Not one promise from God is empty of power. Nothing is impossible with God!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">Then Mary responded, saying, &amp;apos; Yes! I will be a mother for the Lord! As his servant, I accept whatever he has for me. May everything you have told me come to pass.&amp;apos; And the angel left her.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">Afterward, Mary arose and hurried off to the hill country of Judea, to the village where Zechariah and Elizabeth lived.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="56">Before going home, Mary stayed with Elizabeth for about three months.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="57">When Elizabeth&amp;quot;s pregnancy was full term, she gave birth to a son.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="58">All her family, friends, and neighbors heard about it, and they too were overjoyed, for they realized that the Lord had showered his wonderful mercy upon her.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="59">When the baby was eight days old, according to their custom, all the family and friends came together for the circumcision ceremony. Everyone assumed that the parents would name the baby Zechariah, after his father,</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="61">&amp;apos;What?&amp;apos; they exclaimed. &amp;apos;No one in your family line has that name!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="62">So they gestured to the baby&amp;quot;s father to ask what to name the child.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="18">Everyone who heard the shepherds&amp;quot; story was astonished by what they were told.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">But Mary treasured all these things in her heart and often pondered what they meant.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">The shepherds returned to their flock, ecstatic over what had happened. They praised God and glorified him for all they had heard and seen for themselves, just like the angel had said.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">On the day of the baby&amp;quot;s circumcision ceremony, eight days after his birth, his parents gave him the name Jesus, the name prophesied by the angel before he was born.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Forty days after the birth of her son, Mary&amp;quot;s time of purification had completed, so she came to the temple with a sacrifice, according to the law of Moses. So Mary and Joseph took baby Jesus to Jerusalem to be dedicated before the Lord.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">For it is stated in the law of the Lord, &amp;apos;Every firstborn male shall be set apart for God&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">and is required to offer a prescribed sacrifice, &amp;apos;either a pair of turtledoves or two young pigeons.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">As they came to the temple to fulfill this requirement, an elderly man was there waiting&amp;ndash;a resident of Jerusalem whose name was Simeon. He was a very good man, a lover of God who kept himself pure, and the Spirit of holiness rested upon him. Simeon believed in the imminent appearing of the one called &amp;apos;The Refreshing of Israel.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">For the Holy Spirit had revealed to him that he would not see death before he saw the Messiah, the Anointed One of God.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="38">While Simeon was prophesying over Mary and Joseph and the baby, Anna walked up to them and burst forth with a great chorus of praise to God for the child. From that day forward she told everyone in Jerusalem who was waiting for their redemption that the anticipated Messiah had come!</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="44">They had assumed he was somewhere in their entourage, but he was nowhere to be found. After a frantic search among relatives and friends,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45">Mary and Joseph returned to Jerusalem to search for him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46">After being separated from him for three days, they finally found him in the temple, sitting among the Jewish teachers, listening to them and asking probing questions.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="47">All who heard Jesus speak were awestruck at his intelligent understanding of all that was being discussed and at his wise answers to their questions.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="48">His parents were shocked to find him there, and Mary scolded him, saying, &amp;apos;Son, your father and I have searched for you everywhere! We have been worried sick over not finding you. Why would you do this to us?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="49">Jesus said to them, &amp;apos;Why would you need to search for me? Didn&amp;quot;t you know that it was necessary for me to be here in my Father&amp;quot;s house, consumed with him?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="50">Mary and Joseph didn&amp;quot;t fully understand what Jesus meant.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="51">Jesus went back home with them to Nazareth and was obedient to them. His mother treasured Jesus&amp;quot; words deeply in her heart.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="3">John went preaching and baptizing throughout the Jordan Valley. He persuaded people to turn away from their sins and turn to God for the freedom of forgiveness,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">fulfilling what was written in the book of the prophet Isaiah: &amp;apos;Listen!

			<VERS vnumber="7">John kept preaching to the many crowds who came out to be baptized, &amp;apos;You are nothing but the offspring of venomous snakes, full of deception! Who warned you to repent before the coming wrath of God?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Then turn away from your sins, turn to God, and let your changed life be proof. Don&amp;quot;t think for a moment that it&amp;quot;s enough to simply be the favored descendants of Abraham. That&amp;quot;s not enough to save you . I&amp;quot;m telling you, God could make more sons of Abraham out of stones if he chose to!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">&amp;apos;Even now God&amp;quot;s axe of judgment is poised to chop down your barren tree right down to its roots! And every tree that does not produce good fruit will be leveled and thrown into the fire.&amp;apos;</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="11">John told them, &amp;apos;Give food to the hungry, clothe the poor, and bless the needy.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Even the despised tax collectors came to John to be baptized, and they asked him, &amp;apos;What are we to do to prove our hearts have changed?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">&amp;apos;Be honest,&amp;apos; he replied. &amp;apos;Don&amp;quot;t demand more taxes than what the law requires.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">&amp;apos;And us?&amp;apos; asked some soldiers. &amp;apos;What about us?&amp;apos; John answered them, &amp;apos;Be content with what you earn. Never extort money or terrify others by threats of violence or be guilty of accusing the innocent.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">During those days, everyone was gripped with messianic expectations, believing the Messiah could come at any moment, and many began to wonder if John might be the Christ.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">But John made it clear by telling them, &amp;apos;There is one coming who is mightier than I. He is supreme. In fact, I&amp;quot;m not worthy of even being his slave.

			<VERS vnumber="18">John used many similar warnings as he preached the good news and prepared the people.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">He even publicly rebuked Antipas, son of Herod, the governor of Galilee, for the many wicked things he had done. He fearlessly reprimanded him for seducing and marrying his sister-in-law, Herodias.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="3">It was then the devil said to him, &amp;apos;If you are really the Son of God, command this stone to turn into a loaf of bread for you.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Jesus replied, &amp;apos;I will not! For it is written in the Scriptures, &amp;quot;Life does not come only from eating bread but from God. Life flows from every revelation from his mouth.&amp;quot; &amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">The devil lifted Jesus high into the sky, and in a flash showed him all the kingdoms and regions of the world.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Jesus rebuked him and said, &amp;apos;Satan, get behind me! For it is written in the Scriptures, &amp;quot;Only One is worthy of adoration; therefore, worship only the Lord your God and love him supremely.&amp;quot; &amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Next, the devil took Jesus to Jerusalem, set him on the highest point of the temple, and tempted him, saying, &amp;apos;If you really are the Son of God, jump down in front of all the people.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Jesus replied, &amp;apos;It is also written in the Scriptures, &amp;quot;How dare you provoke the Lord your God!&amp;quot; &amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">That silenced the devil&amp;quot;s harassment for the time being. So he retreated until an opportune time.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Then Jesus, armed with the Holy Spirit&amp;quot;s power, returned to Galilee, and his fame spread throughout the region.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">He taught in the synagogues and they glorified him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">After he read this he rolled up the scroll, handed it back to the attendant, and sat down. Everyone stared at Jesus, wondering what he was about to say.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Then he added, &amp;apos;Today, these Scriptures came true in front of you.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Everyone was impressed by how well Jesus spoke, in awe of the beautiful words of grace that came from his lips. But they said among themselves, &amp;apos; Who does he think he is? Isn&amp;quot;t he Joseph&amp;quot;s son, who grew up here in Nazareth ?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">Jesus said to them, &amp;apos;I suppose you&amp;quot;ll quote me the proverb, &amp;quot;Doctor, go and heal yourself before you try to heal others.&amp;quot; And you&amp;quot;ll say, &amp;quot;Work the miracles here in your hometown that we heard you did in Capernaum.&amp;quot;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">But let me tell you, no prophet is welcomed or honored in his own hometown.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">&amp;apos;Isn&amp;quot;t it true that many widows lived in the land of Israel during the days of the prophet Elijah when he locked up the heavens for three and a half years and brought a devastating famine over all the land?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">But he wasn&amp;quot;t sent to any of the widows living in that region. Instead, he was sent to a foreign place, to a widow in Zarephath of Sidon.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">Or have you not considered that the prophet Elisha healed only Naaman, the Syrian, rather than one of the many Jewish lepers living in the land?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">When everyone present heard Jesus&amp;quot; words, they erupted with furious rage.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">They mobbed Jesus and threw him out of the city, dragging him to the edge of the cliff on the hill on which the city had been built, ready to hurl him off.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">But he walked right through the crowd, leaving them all stunned.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">Jesus went to Capernaum in Galilee and taught the people on the Sabbath day.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">His teaching stunned and dazed them, for he spoke with penetrating words and great authority.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">In the congregation, there was a demonized man, who screamed out with a loud voice,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">&amp;apos;Go away and leave us alone. We know who you are. You&amp;quot;re Jesus of Nazareth, God&amp;quot;s Holy One. What do you want with us? Have you come to destroy us already?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">Immediately the demon hurled the man down on the floor in front of them. But Jesus rebuked the demon, &amp;apos;Be quiet and come out of him!&amp;apos; And without causing him any harm, the demon came out of him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">Great astonishment swept over the people, and they said among themselves, &amp;apos;What kind of man is this who has such power and authority? With a mere word, he commands demons to come out, and they obey him!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">Reports about Jesus spread like wildfire throughout every community in the surrounding region.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">After leaving the synagogue, Jesus went into Simon&amp;quot;s house, where Simon&amp;quot;s mother-in-law was sick with a high fever. The disciples begged Jesus to help her.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">Jesus stood over her and rebuked the fever, and she was healed instantly. Then she got up and began to serve them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">At sunset, the people brought all those who were sick to Jesus to be healed. Jesus laid his hands on them one by one, and he healed them all of different illnesses.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">Demons also came out of many of them. Knowing that Jesus was the Anointed One, the demons shouted while coming out, &amp;apos;You are the Messiah, the Son of El Shaddai!&amp;apos; But Jesus rebuked them and commanded them to be silent.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">At daybreak the next morning, the crowds came and searched everywhere for him, but Jesus had already left to go to a secluded place. When they finally found him, they held him tightly, begging him to stay with them in Capernaum.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43">But Jesus said, &amp;apos;Don&amp;quot;t you know there are other places I must go and offer the hope of God&amp;quot;s kingdom? This is what I have been sent to do.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44">Jesus continued to travel and preach in the synagogues throughout the land.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="5">
			<VERS vnumber="1">On one occasion, Jesus was preaching to a crowd on the shore of Lake Galilee. A vast multitude of people was pushing to get close to Jesus to hear the word of God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">He noticed two fishing boats at the water&amp;quot;s edge, with the fishermen nearby, rinsing their nets.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Jesus climbed into the boat belonging to Simon Peter and said to him, &amp;apos;Let me use your boat. Push it off a short distance away from the shore so I can speak to the crowd.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Jesus sat down and taught the people from the boat. When he had finished, he said to Peter, &amp;apos;Now row out to deep water to cast your nets and you will have a great catch.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">&amp;apos;Master,&amp;apos; Peter replied, &amp;apos;we&amp;quot;ve just come back from fishing all night and didn&amp;quot;t catch a thing. But if you insist, we&amp;quot;ll go out again and let down our nets because of your word.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">When they pulled up their nets, they were shocked to see a huge catch of fish, and their nets were ready to burst!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">They waved to their business partners in the other boat for help. They ended up completely filling both boats with fish until they began to sink!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">When Simon Peter saw this astonishing miracle , he knelt at Jesus&amp;quot; feet and begged him, &amp;apos;Go away from me, Master, for I am a sinful man!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">After pulling their boats to the shore, they left everything behind and followed Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">One day, while Jesus was in a certain city, he came upon a man covered with leprous sores. When the man recognized Jesus, he fell on his face at Jesus&amp;quot; feet and begged to be healed, saying, &amp;apos;If you were willing, you could completely heal me.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">After this miracle, the news about Jesus spread even farther. Massive crowds continually gathered to hear him speak and to be healed from their illnesses.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">But Jesus often slipped away from them and went into the wilderness to pray.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">One day, many Jewish religious leaders known as Pharisees, along with many religious scholars, came from every village in Galilee, throughout Judea, and even from Jerusalem to hear Jesus teach. And the power of the Lord God surged through him to instantly heal the sick.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Some men came to Jesus, carrying a paraplegic man on a stretcher. They attempted to bring him in past the crowd to set him down in front of Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">But because there were so many people crowding the door, they had no way to bring him inside. So they crawled onto the roof, dug their way through the roof tiles, and lowered the man, stretcher and all, into the middle of the crowd, right in front of Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Seeing the demonstration of their faith, Jesus said to the paraplegic man, &amp;apos;My friend, your sins are forgiven!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">The Jewish religious leaders and the religious scholars whispered objections among themselves. &amp;apos;Who does this man think he is to speak such blasphemy? Only God can forgive sins! Does he think he is God? &amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">&amp;apos;To prove to you all that I, the Son of Man, have the lawful authority on earth to forgive sins, I say to you now, stand up! Carry your stretcher and go on home, for you are healed.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">In an instant, the man rose right before their eyes. He stood, picked up his stretcher, and went home, giving God the glory with every step he took.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">The people were seized with astonishment and dumbfounded over what they had just witnessed. And they all praised God, remarking over and over, &amp;apos;Incredible! What an unbelievable miracle we&amp;quot;ve seen today!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">Afterward, Jesus went out and looked for a man named Matthew. He found him sitting at his tax booth, for he was a tax collector. Jesus said to him, &amp;apos;Be my disciple and follow me.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">That very moment, Matthew got up, left everything behind, and followed him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">Jesus overheard their complaining and said, &amp;apos;Who goes to the doctor for a cure? Those who are well or those who are sick?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">I have not come to call the &amp;quot;righteous,&amp;quot; but to call those who know they are sinners and bring them to repentance.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">Jesus&amp;quot; critics questioned him. &amp;apos;John the prophet is known for leading his disciples to fast often and pray. As the religious leaders of the land, we do the same. Why do you and your disciples spend most of your time feasting at banquets?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">Jesus replied, &amp;apos;Should you make the sons of the bridal chamber fast while celebrating with the Bridegroom?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">But when the Bridegroom is taken away from them, then you will see them fasting.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">And he gave them this illustration: &amp;apos;No one rips up a new garment to make patches for an old, worn-out one. If you tear up the new to make a patch for the old, it would not match the old garment.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">And who pours new wine into an old wineskin? If someone did, the old wineskin would burst and the new wine would be lost.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">New wine must always be poured into new wineskins.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">Yet you say, &amp;quot;The old ways are better,&amp;quot; and you refuse to even taste the new wine that I bring.&amp;apos;</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="6">
			<VERS vnumber="1">One Sabbath day, Jesus and his disciples were walking through a field of ripe wheat. His disciples plucked some heads of grain, rubbed the husks off with their hands, and ate them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">This infuriated some of the Jewish religious leaders. They said to Jesus, &amp;apos;Why are you allowing your disciples to harvest grain on the Sabbath? Don&amp;quot;t you know it&amp;quot;s not permissible according to the law?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Jesus replied, &amp;apos;Haven&amp;quot;t you read the Scriptures? Haven&amp;quot;t you read what King David did when he was hungry?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">He entered the sanctuary of God, took the bread of God&amp;quot;s presence right off the sacred table, and shared it with his men. It was only lawful for the priests to eat the bread of God&amp;quot;s presence.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">You need to know that the Son of Man is no slave to the Sabbath, for I am master over the Sabbath.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Jesus, knowing their every thought, said to the man with the deformed hand, &amp;apos;Come and stand here in the middle of the room.&amp;apos; So he got up and came forward.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Jesus said to all who were there, &amp;apos;Let me ask you a question. Which is better: to heal or to do harm on the Sabbath? I have come to save a life, but you have come to find a life to destroy.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">One by one Jesus looked into the eyes of each person in the room. Then he said to the man, &amp;apos;Stretch out your arm and open your hand!&amp;apos; With everyone watching intently, he stretched out his arm, and his hand was completely healed! &amp;apos;How content you become when you weep with complete brokenness , for you will laugh with unrestrained joy. &amp;apos;What sorrows await those of you who laugh now, having received all your joy in this life only, for grief and wailing will come to you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">The room erupted with bitter rage, and from that moment on, the religious leaders plotted among themselves about how they might harm Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">After leaving the synagogue, Jesus went into the high hills to spend the whole night in prayer to God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">At daybreak, he called together all of his followers and selected twelve from among them, and he appointed them to be his apostles.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Jesus and his apostles came down from the hillside to a level field, where a large number of his disciples waited, along with a massive crowd: people from all over Judea, Jerusalem, and the coastal district of Tyre and Sidon.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">They had all come to listen to the Word so that they could be healed of their diseases and be set free from tormenting demonic powers.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">The entire crowd eagerly tried to come near Jesus, to touch him to receive healing, because a tangible, supernatural power emanated from him and healed all who came close to him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Looking intently at his followers, Jesus began his sermon. &amp;apos;How enriched you become when you are a beggar, for you will experience the reality of God&amp;quot;s kingdom.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">&amp;apos;How filled you become when you are consumed with hunger and desire, for you will be completely satisfied.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">&amp;apos;How favored you become when you are hated, excommunicated, or slandered, or when your name is spoken of as evil because of your love for me, the Son of Man.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">&amp;apos;I promise you that as you experience these things, you will celebrate and dance with overflowing joy, and the heavenly reward of your faith will be abundant, because you are being treated the same way as your forefathers the prophets.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">&amp;apos;But what sorrows await those of you who are rich in this life only, for you have already received all the comfort you&amp;quot;ll ever get.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">&amp;apos;What sorrows await those of you who are content with yourselves, for hunger and emptiness will come to you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">&amp;apos;What sorrows await those of you who are always honored and lauded by others, for that&amp;quot;s how your forefathers treated every false prophet.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">&amp;apos;But I say to you who hear, love your enemies and do something wonderful for them in return for their hatred.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">When someone curses you, bless that person in return. When others mistreat and harass you, accept it as your mission to pray for them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">To those who despise you, continue to serve them and minister to them. If someone takes away your coat, give him as a gift your shirt as well.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">When someone comes to beg from you, give to that person what you have. When things are wrongly taken from you, do not demand they be given back.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">The way you want others to treat you is how you should treat everyone else.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">&amp;apos;Are you really showing true love by loving only those who love you? Even those who don&amp;quot;t know God will do that.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">Are you really showing compassion when you do good deeds only to those who do good deeds to you? Even those who don&amp;quot;t know God will do that.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">&amp;apos;If you lend money only to those you know will repay you, what credit is that to your character? Even those who don&amp;quot;t know God do that.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">Rather love your enemies and continue to treat them well. When you lend money, don&amp;quot;t despair if you are never paid back, for it is not lost. You will receive a rich reward and you will be known as true children of the Most High God, having his same nature. Be like your Father who is famous for his kindness to heal even the thankless and cruel.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">Overflow with mercy and compassion for others, just as your heavenly Father overflows with mercy and compassion for all.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">Jesus said, &amp;apos;Forsake the habit of criticizing and judging others, and you will not be criticized and judged in return. Don&amp;quot;t condemn others and you will not be condemned. Forgive over and over, and you will be forgiven over and over.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">Give generously and generous gifts will be given back to you, shaken down to make room for more. Abundant gifts will pour out upon you with such an overflowing measure that it will run over the top! The measurement of your generosity becomes the measurement of your return.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">Jesus also quoted these proverbs: &amp;apos;What happens when a blind man pretends to guide another blind man? They both stumble into a ditch!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">And how could the apprentice know more than his master, for only after he is fully qualified will he be at that level.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">Why do you focus on the flaw in someone else&amp;quot;s life and fail to notice the glaring flaws of your own life?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">How could you say to your friend, &amp;quot;Here, let me show you where you&amp;quot;re wrong,&amp;quot; when you are guilty of even more than he? You are overly critical, splitting hairs and being a hypocrite! You must acknowledge your own blind spots and deal with them before you will be able to deal with the blind spot of your friend.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43">&amp;apos;You&amp;quot;ll never find choice fruit hanging on a bad, unhealthy tree. And rotten fruit doesn&amp;quot;t hang on a good, healthy tree.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44">Every tree will be revealed by the quality of fruit that it produces. You will never pick figs or grapes from thorn trees.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45">People are known in this same way. Out of the virtue stored in their hearts, good and upright people will produce good fruit. Likewise, out of the evil hidden in their hearts, evil ones will produce what is evil. For the overflow of what has been stored in your heart will be seen by your fruit and will be heard in your words.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46">&amp;apos;What good does it do for you to say I am your Lord and Master if you don&amp;quot;t put into practice what I teach you?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="47">Let me describe the one who truly follows me and does what I say:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="48">He is like a man who chooses the right place to build a house and then lays a deep and secure foundation. When the storms and floods rage against that house, it continues to stand strong and unshaken through the tempest, for he built it wisely on the right foundation.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="49">But the one who has heard my teaching and does not obey it is like a man who builds a house without laying any foundation at all. When the storms and floods rage against that house, it will immediately collapse and become a total loss. Which of these two builders will you be? &amp;apos;</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="7">
			<VERS vnumber="1">After Jesus finished giving revelation to the people on the hillside, he went on to Capernaum.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">So they came to Jesus and told him, &amp;apos;The Roman captain is a wonderful man. If anyone deserves a visit from you, it is him. Won&amp;quot;t you please come to his home and heal his servant?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">For he loves the Jewish people, and he even built our meeting hall for us.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">I am an ordinary man. Yet I understand the power of authority, and I see that authority operating through you . I have soldiers under me who obey everything I command. I also have authorities over me whom I likewise obey. So Master, just speak the word and healing will flow.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Jesus marveled at this. He turned around and said to the crowd who had followed him, &amp;apos;Listen, everyone! Never have I found among the people of God a man like this who believes so strongly in me.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Jesus then spoke the healing word from a distance. When the man&amp;quot;s friends returned to the home, they found the servant completely healed and doing fine.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Shortly afterward, Jesus left on a journey to the village of Nain, with a massive crowd of people following him, and his disciples.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">As he approached the village, he met a multitude of people in a funeral procession, who were mourning as they carried the body of a young man to the cemetery. The boy was his mother&amp;quot;s only son, and she was a widow.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">When the Lord saw the grieving mother, his heart broke for her. With great tenderness he said to her, &amp;apos;Please don&amp;quot;t cry.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Then he stepped up to the coffin and touched it. When the pallbearers came to a halt, Jesus spoke directly to the corpse, &amp;apos;Young man, I say to you, arise and live!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Immediately, the young man moved, sat up, and spoke to those nearby. Jesus presented the son to his mother, alive!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">A tremendous sense of holy mystery swept over the crowd. They shouted praises to God, saying, &amp;apos;God himself has blessed us by visiting his people! A great prophet has appeared among us!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">The news of Jesus and this miracle raced throughout Judea and the entire surrounding region.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">John&amp;quot;s disciples reported to him in prison about all the wonderful miracles and the works Jesus was doing.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">So John dispatched two of his disciples to go and inquire of Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">When they came before the Master, they asked him, &amp;apos;Are you the coming Messiah we&amp;quot;ve been expecting, or are we to continue to look for someone else? John the prophet has sent us to you to seek your answer.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Without answering, Jesus turned to the crowd and healed many of their incurable diseases. His miracle power freed many from their suffering. He restored the gift of sight to the blind, and he drove out demonic spirits from those who were tormented.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Only then did Jesus answer the question posed by John&amp;quot;s disciples. &amp;apos;Now go back and tell John what you have just seen and heard here today. The blind are now seeing. The crippled are now walking. Those who were lepers are now cured. Those who were deaf are now hearing. Those who were dead are now brought back to life. The poor and broken are given the hope of salvation.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">And tell John these words: &amp;quot;The blessing of heaven comes upon those who never lose their faith in me, no matter what happens.&amp;quot; &amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">After John&amp;quot;s messengers departed, Jesus spoke about John to the audience crowded around him, saying, &amp;apos;What kind of man did you expect to see out in the wilderness? Did you expect to see a man who would be easily influenced and shaken by the shifting opinions of others?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">Who did you go there to see? Did you expect to see a man decked out in the splendid fashion of the day living in the lap of luxury?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">Or did you discover a true prophet out in the lonely wilderness? Yes, John was a legitimate prophet. Even more than that,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">he was the fulfillment of this Scripture: &amp;quot;See, I am sending my prophetic messenger to prepare hearts to receive me.&amp;quot; who will go ahead of me &amp;apos;Go ahead, Teacher. I want to hear it,&amp;apos; he answered. &amp;apos;You&amp;quot;re right,&amp;apos; Jesus agreed. &amp;apos;Do you see this woman kneeling here? She is doing for me what you didn&amp;quot;t bother to do. When I entered your home as your guest, you didn&amp;quot;t think about offering me water to wash the dust off my feet. Yet she came into your home and washed my feet with her many tears and then dried my feet with her hair.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">&amp;apos;Throughout history there was never found a man as great as John. Yet those who now walk in God&amp;quot;s kingdom realm, though they appear to be insignificant, will become even greater than he.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">When the common and disreputable people among the audience heard Jesus say this, they acknowledged that it was the truth, for they had already experienced John&amp;quot;s baptism.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">But the hearts of the Jewish religious leaders and experts of the law had rejected the clear purpose of God by refusing to be baptized by John.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">Jesus continued, saying, &amp;apos;How could I describe the people of this generation? Can&amp;quot;t you see?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">You&amp;quot;re like children playing games on the playground, complaining to friends, &amp;quot;You don&amp;quot;t like it when we want to play Wedding. And you don&amp;quot;t like it when we want to play Funeral. Why will you neither dance nor mourn?&amp;quot;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">&amp;apos;When the prophet John came fasting and refused to drink wine, you said, &amp;quot;He&amp;quot;s crazy! There&amp;quot;s a demon in him.&amp;quot;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">Yet when the Son of Man came feasting and drinking, you said, &amp;quot;Look at this man! He is nothing but a glutton and a drunkard. He spends all his time with tax collectors and other notorious sinners.&amp;quot;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">&amp;apos;Nevertheless, the wisdom of God will be proven true by the expressions of godliness in everyone who follows me.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">Afterward Simeon, a Jewish religious leader, asked Jesus to his home for dinner. Jesus accepted the invitation. When he went to Simeon&amp;quot;s home, he took his place at the table.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">In the neighborhood there was an immoral woman of the streets, known to all to be a prostitute. When she heard that Jesus was at Simeon&amp;quot;s house, she took an exquisite flask made from alabaster, filled it with the most expensive perfume, went right into the home of the Jewish religious leader, and in front of all the guests, she knelt at the feet of Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">Broken and weeping, she covered his feet with the tears that fell from her face. She kept crying and drying his feet with her long hair. Over and over she kissed Jesus&amp;quot; feet. Then, as an act of worship, she opened her flask and anointed his feet with her costly perfume.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">When Simeon saw what was happening, he thought, &amp;apos;This man can&amp;quot;t be a true prophet. If he were really a prophet, he would know what kind of sinful woman is touching him.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">Jesus said, &amp;apos;Simeon, I have a word for you.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">&amp;apos;It&amp;quot;s a story about two men who were deeply in debt. One owed the bank one hundred thousand dollars, and the other only owed ten thousand dollars.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">When it was obvious that neither of them would be able to repay their debts, the kind banker graciously wrote off the debts and forgave them all that they owed. Tell me, Simeon, which of the two debtors would be more thankful? Which one would love the banker most?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43">Simeon answered, &amp;apos;I suppose it would be the one with the greater debt forgiven.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44">Then he spoke to Simeon about the woman still weeping at his feet.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45">You didn&amp;quot;t even welcome me into your home with the customary kiss of greeting, but from the moment I came in she has not stopped kissing my feet.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46">You didn&amp;quot;t take the time to anoint my head with fragrant oil, but she anointed my head and feet with the finest perfume.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="47">She has been forgiven of all her many sins. This is why she has shown me such extravagant love. But those who assume they have very little to be forgiven will love me very little.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="48">Then Jesus said to the woman at his feet, &amp;apos; All your sins are forgiven.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="49">All the dinner guests said among themselves, &amp;apos;Who is the one who can even forgive sins?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="50">Then Jesus said to the woman, &amp;apos;Your faith in me has given you life. Now you may leave and walk in the ways of peace.&amp;apos;</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="8">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Soon afterward, Jesus began a ministry tour throughout the country, visiting cities and villages to announce the wonderful news of God&amp;quot;s kingdom. His twelve disciples traveled with him</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">as did a number of women who had been healed of many illnesses and set free from demonic power. One of the women was Mary who was from the village of Magdala, from whom Jesus had cast out seven demons. Among the women were Susanna and</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Joanna, the wife of Chusa, who managed King Herod&amp;quot;s household. Many other women who supported Jesus&amp;quot; ministry from their own personal finances also traveled with him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Massive crowds gathered from many towns to hear Jesus, and he taught them using metaphors and parables, such as this:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">&amp;apos;A farmer went out to sow seeds for a harvest. As he scattered his seeds, some of them fell on the hard pathway and were quickly trampled down and unable to grow and became nothing but bird seed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Some fell on the gravel, and though they sprouted they couldn&amp;quot;t take root; it withered for lack of moisture.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Other seeds fell where there was nothing but weeds. They too were unable to grow to full maturity, for the weeds choked them out.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Yet some of the seeds fell into good, fertile soil, and they grew and flourished until they produced more than a hundredfold harvest, a bumper crop.&amp;apos; Then Jesus added, shouting out to all who would hear, &amp;apos;Listen with your heart and you will understand!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Later his disciples came to him privately to ask him what deeper meaning they could find in this parable.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">He said, &amp;apos;You have been given a teachable heart to perceive the secret, hidden mysteries of God&amp;quot;s kingdom realm. But to those without a listening heart, my words are merely stories. Even though they have eyes, they are blind to the true meaning of what I say, and even though they listen, they won&amp;quot;t receive full revelation.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">&amp;apos;Here, then, is the deeper meaning to my parable: The word of God is the seed that is sown into hearts.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">The hard pathway represents the hard hearts of those who hear the word of God but the slanderer quickly snatches away what was sown in their hearts to keep them from believing and experiencing salvation.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">The seeds falling on gravel represents those who initially respond to the word with joy, but soon afterward, when a season of difficulty and harassment of the enemy comes to them, they wither and fall away, for they have no root in the truth and their faith is temporary.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">The seeds that fall into the weeds represents the hearts of those who hear the word of God but their growth is quickly choked off by their own anxious cares, the riches of this world, and the fleeting pleasures of this life. This is why they never become mature and fruitful.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">The seed that fell into good, fertile soil represents those lovers of truth who hear it deep within their hearts. They respond by clinging to the word, keeping it dear as they endure all things in faith. This is the seed that will one day bear much fruit in their lives.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">&amp;apos;No one lights a lamp and then hides it, covering it over or putting it where no one sees its light. No, he places the lamp on a lampstand so others benefit from its brightness.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Because this revelation lamp now shines within you, nothing will be hidden from you&amp;ndash;it will all be revealed. Every secret of the kingdom will be unveiled and out in the open, made known by the revelation-light.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">So pay careful attention to your hearts as you listen to my teaching, for to those who have open hearts, even more revelation will be given to them until it overflows. And for those who do not listen with open hearts, what little light they imagine themselves to have will be taken away.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Jesus&amp;quot; mother and his brothers came to where Jesus was teaching, but they couldn&amp;quot;t get through the crowd that had gathered around him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Someone told Jesus, &amp;apos;Your mother and brothers are standing outside, wanting to speak with you.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Jesus told the crowd, &amp;apos;These who come to listen to me are like my mother and my brothers. They&amp;quot;re the ones who long to hear God&amp;quot;s words and put them into practice.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">Alarmed, the disciples woke Jesus up and said, &amp;apos;Master, Master, we&amp;quot;re sinking! Don&amp;quot;t you care that we&amp;quot;re going to drown?&amp;apos; With great authority Jesus rebuked the howling wind and surging waves, and instantly they became calm. Jesus commanded the demons to come out of him, and they shouted, &amp;apos;We beg you, don&amp;quot;t torture us!&amp;apos; After hearing about such amazing power, the townspeople became frightened. Jesus sent him away with these instructions: As Jesus started to go with him to his home to see her, a large crowd surrounded him. Jesus directed her stunned parents to give her something to eat and ordered them to tell no one what just happened.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">Then Jesus said to them, &amp;apos;Why are you fearful? Have you lost your faith in me ?&amp;apos; Shocked, they said with amazement to one another, &amp;apos;Who is this man who has authority over winds and waves that they obey him?&amp;apos; &amp;apos;Mob,&amp;apos; the demons answered. &amp;apos;We are a mob, for there are many of us here in this man. While they all denied it, Peter pointed out, &amp;apos;Master, everyone is touching you, trying to get close to you. The crowds are so thick we can&amp;quot;t walk through all these people without being jostled.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">Jesus asked the man, &amp;apos;What is your name?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">We beg you, don&amp;quot;t banish us into the Abyss!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">On the hillside nearby, there was a large herd of pigs, and the demons pleaded with Jesus, &amp;apos;Let us enter into the pigs.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">So Jesus ordered all the &amp;apos;mob&amp;apos; of demons to come out of the man and enter the pigs. The crazed herd of swine stampeded over the cliff into the lake and all of them drowned.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">When the herders tending the pigs saw what had happened, they ran off in fear and reported it to the nearby town and throughout the countryside.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">Then the people of the region came out to see for themselves what had happened. When they came to where Jesus was, they discovered the notorious madman totally set free. He was clothed, speaking intelligently, and sitting at the feet of Jesus. They were shocked!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">Then eyewitnesses to the miracle reported all that they had seen and how Jesus completely delivered the demonized man from his torment.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">Soon all the people of the region of the Gerasenes and the surrounding country pleaded with Jesus to leave them, for they were gripped with fear. So Jesus got into the boat, intending to return to Galilee.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">But the man who had been set free begged Jesus over and over not to leave, saying, &amp;apos;Let me be with you!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">&amp;apos;Return to your home and your family, and tell them all the wonderful things God has done for you.&amp;apos; So the man went back and preached to everyone who would listen about the amazing miracle Jesus had worked in his life.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">When Jesus returned to Galilee, the crowds were overjoyed, for they had been waiting for him to arrive.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43">In the crowd that day was a woman who had suffered greatly for twelve years from slow bleeding. Even though she had spent all that she had on healers, she was still suffering.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44">Pressing in through the crowd, she came up behind Jesus and touched the fringe of his garment. Instantly her bleeding stopped and she was healed .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45">Jesus suddenly stopped and said to his disciples, &amp;apos;Someone touched me. Who was it?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46">Jesus replied, &amp;apos;Yes, but I felt power surge through me. Someone touched me to be healed, and they received their healing.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="47">When the woman realized she couldn&amp;quot;t hide any longer, she came and fell trembling at Jesus&amp;quot; feet. Before the entire crowd she declared, &amp;apos;I was desperate to touch you, Jesus, for I knew if I could just touch even the fringe of your garment I would be healed.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="48">Jesus responded, &amp;apos;Beloved daughter, your faith in me released your healing. You may go with my peace.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="49">While Jesus was still speaking to the woman, someone came from Jairus&amp;quot; house and told him, &amp;apos;There&amp;quot;s no need to bother the Master any further. Your daughter has passed away. She&amp;quot;s gone.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="50">When Jesus heard this, he turned to Jairus and said, &amp;apos;Don&amp;quot;t yield to your fear. Have faith in me and she will live again.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="51">When they arrived at the house, Jesus allowed only Peter, John, and Jacob&amp;ndash;along with the child&amp;quot;s parents&amp;ndash;to go inside.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="52">Jesus told those left outside, who were sobbing and wailing with grief, &amp;apos;Stop crying. She is not dead; she&amp;quot;s just asleep and must be awakened.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="53">They laughed at him, knowing for certain that she had died.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="54">Jesus approached the body, took the girl by her hand, and called out with a loud voice, &amp;apos;My sleeping child, awake! Rise up!&amp;apos;</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="9">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Jesus summoned together his twelve apostles and imparted to them authority over every demon and the power to heal every disease.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Then he commissioned them to proclaim God&amp;quot;s kingdom and to heal the sick to demonstrate that the kingdom had arrived. As he sent them out, he gave them these instructions:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">&amp;apos;Take nothing extra on your journey. Just go as you are. Don&amp;quot;t carry a staff, a backpack, food, money, not even a change of clothes.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Whatever home welcomes you as a guest, remain there and make it your base of ministry.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">And wherever your ministry is rejected, you are to leave that town and shake the dust off your shoes as a testimony before them.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">The apostles departed and went into the villages with the wonderful news of God&amp;quot;s kingdom, and they healed diseases wherever they went.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Now, Herod, the governor, was confused and perplexed when he heard reports of all the miracles of Jesus and his apostles. Many were saying, &amp;apos;John the Baptizer has come back to life!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Others said, &amp;apos;This has to be Elijah who has reappeared or one of the prophets of old who has risen from the dead.&amp;apos; These were the rumors circulating throughout the land. Herod exclaimed, They replied, &amp;apos;All we have are these five small loaves of bread and two dried fish. Do you really expect us to go buy food for all these people? Peter said, &amp;apos;You are the Anointed One, God&amp;quot;s Messiah!&amp;apos; &amp;apos;I, the Son of Man, will one day return in my radiant brightness, with the holy angels and in the splendor and majesty of my Father. On that day I will be ashamed of everyone who has been ashamed of me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">&amp;apos;Who is this Man? I keep hearing about him over and over. It can&amp;quot;t be the prophet John; I had him beheaded!&amp;apos; So, Herod was very eager to meet Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Months later , the apostles returned from their ministry tour and told Jesus all the wonders and miracles they had witnessed. Jesus, wanting to be alone with the Twelve, quietly slipped away with them toward Bethsaida.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Crowds soon found out about it and took off after him. When they caught up with Jesus, he graciously welcomed them all, taught them more about God&amp;quot;s kingdom, and healed all who were sick.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">As the day wore on, the Twelve came to Jesus and told him, &amp;apos;It&amp;quot;s getting late. You should send the crowds to the surrounding villages and farms to get something to eat and find shelter for the night. There&amp;quot;s nothing to eat here in the middle of nowhere.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Jesus responded, &amp;apos;You have the food to feed them.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">There are nearly five thousand men here, with women and children besides !&amp;apos; He told his disciples, &amp;apos;Have them all sit down in groups of fifty each.&amp;apos; He replied, &amp;apos;Someday I will, Lord, but allow me first to fulfill my duty as a good son and wait until my father passes away.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">So everyone ate until they were filled, and afterward the disciples gathered up the leftovers&amp;ndash;it came to exactly twelve baskets full!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">One time, Jesus was praying in a quiet place with his disciples nearby. He went to them and asked, &amp;apos;Who do people think I am?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">They answered, &amp;apos;Some are convinced you&amp;quot;re the prophet John who has returned. Others say you are Elijah, or perhaps one of the Jewish prophets brought back from the dead.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Jesus asked them, &amp;apos;But who do you believe that I am?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Jesus gave them strict orders not to tell this to anyone yet, saying,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">&amp;apos;The Son of Man is destined to experience great suffering and face complete rejection by the Jewish leaders and religious hierarchy. He will be killed and raised back to life on the third day.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">Jesus said to all of his followers, &amp;apos;If you truly desire to be my disciple, you must disown your life completely, embrace my &amp;quot;cross&amp;quot; as your own, and surrender to my ways.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">For if you choose self-sacrifice, giving up your lives for my glory, you will discover true life. But if you choose to keep your lives for yourselves, you will lose what you try to keep.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">Even if you gained all the wealth and power of this world, and all the things it could offer you, yet lost your soul in the process, what good is that?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">So why then are you ashamed of being my disciple? Are you ashamed of the revelation-truth I give to you?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">&amp;apos;I promise you this: there are some of you standing here right now who will not die until you have witnessed the presence and the power of God&amp;quot;s kingdom realm.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">Eight days later, Jesus took Peter, Jacob, and John and climbed a high mountain to pray.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">As he prayed, his face began to glow until a blinding glory streamed from him. A radiant glory illuminated his entire body. His brightness became so intense that it made his clothing blinding white, as multiple flashes of lightning.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">Peter and his companions had become very drowsy, but they became fully awake when they saw the glory and splendor of Jesus standing there and the two men with him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">As Moses and Elijah were about to return to heaven, Peter impetuously blurted, &amp;apos;Master, this is amazing to see the three of you together! Why don&amp;quot;t we stay here and set up three shelters: one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">While Peter was still speaking, a radiant cloud of glory formed above them and overshadowed them. As the glory cloud enveloped them, they were struck with fear.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">Then the voice of God thundered from within the cloud, &amp;apos;This is my Son, my Beloved One. Listen carefully to all he has to say.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">When the thunderous voice faded away and the cloud disappeared, Jesus was standing there alone. Peter, Jacob, and John were awestruck. But they didn&amp;quot;t say a word to anyone about what they had seen.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">The next day, a massive crowd was waiting at the foot of the mountain to meet them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">A man in the crowd shouted desperately, &amp;apos;Please, Teacher, I beg of you, do something about my son, my only son.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">An evil spirit possesses him and makes him scream out in torment, and hardly ever leaves him alone. It throws him into convulsions and he foams at the mouth. When it finally does leave him, he&amp;quot;s left with horrible bruises.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">I begged your disciples to drive it out of him, but they didn&amp;quot;t have enough power to do it.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">Jesus responded, &amp;apos;You are an unbelieving people with no faith! You twist your lives with lies that have turned you away from doing the right things. How much longer should I remain here, offering you hope?&amp;apos; Then he said to the man, &amp;apos;Bring your son to me.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">As the boy approached, the demon slammed him to the ground and threw him into violent convulsions. Jesus sternly commanded the demon to come out of the boy, and it left immediately. Jesus healed the boy of his injuries and returned him to his father, saying , &amp;apos;Here is your son.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43">Everyone was awestruck and stunned to see such power and the majesty of God flow through Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44">Everyone marveled, trying to process what they had just witnessed. Jesus then turned to his disciples and said, &amp;apos;Listen carefully and let these words sink into your hearts. The Son of Man is about to be betrayed and surrendered to the authority of men.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45">But the disciples could not grasp the meaning of what he was saying, for it was a veiled mystery to them, and they were too embarrassed to ask him to explain it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46">The disciples began to argue and became preoccupied over who would be the greatest one among them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="47">Fully aware of their innermost thoughts, Jesus called a little child to his side and said to them,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="48">&amp;apos;If you tenderly care for this little child on my behalf, you are tenderly caring for me. And if you care for me, you are honoring my Father who sent me. The one who is least important in your eyes is actually the most important one of all.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="49">The disciple John said, &amp;apos;Master, we found someone casting out demons using your name and we tried to stop him, because he doesn&amp;quot;t follow you as we do.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="50">Jesus responded, &amp;apos;You shouldn&amp;quot;t have hindered him, for anyone who is not against you is your friend.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="51">Jesus let nothing distract him from departing for Jerusalem because the time for him to be lifted up drew near, and he was full of passion to complete his mission there.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="52">So he sent messengers ahead of him as envoys to a village of the Samaritans.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="53">But as they approached the village, the people turned them away. They would not allow Jesus to enter, for he was on his way to worship in Jerusalem .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="54">When the disciples Jacob and John realized what was happening, they returned to Jesus and said, &amp;apos;Lord, if you wanted to, you could command fire to fall down from heaven, just as Elijah did and destroy all these wicked people.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="55">Jesus rebuked them sharply, saying, &amp;apos;Don&amp;quot;t you realize what spews from your hearts when you say that? The Son of Man did not come to destroy life, but to bring life to the earth.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="56">So they went to another village instead.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="57">On their way, someone came up to Jesus and said, &amp;apos;I want to follow you wherever you go.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="58">Jesus replied, &amp;apos;Yes, but remember this: even animals in the field have holes in the ground to sleep in, and birds have their nests, but the Son of Man has no place to lay down his head.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="59">Jesus then turned to another and said, &amp;apos;Come be my disciple.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="60">Jesus told him, &amp;apos;Don&amp;quot;t wait for your father&amp;quot;s burial. Let those who are already dead wait for death. As for you, go and proclaim everywhere that God&amp;quot;s kingdom has arrived.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="61">Still another said to him, &amp;apos;Lord, I want to follow you too. But first let me go home and say good-bye to my entire family.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="62">Jesus responded, &amp;apos;Why do you keep looking back to your past and have second thoughts about following me? If you turn back you are not fit for God&amp;quot;s kingdom.&amp;apos;</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="10">
			<VERS vnumber="1">After this, the Lord Jesus formed thirty-five teams among the other disciples. Each team was two disciples, seventy in all, and he commissioned them to go ahead of him into every town he was about to visit.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">He released them with these instructions: &amp;apos;The harvest is huge. But there are not enough harvesters to bring it in. As you go, plead with the Owner of the Harvest to send out many more workers into his harvest fields.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Now, off you go! I am sending you out even though you feel as vulnerable as lambs going into a pack of wolves.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">You won&amp;quot;t need to take anything with you&amp;ndash;trust in God alone. And don&amp;quot;t get distracted from my purpose by anyone you might meet along the way.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">&amp;apos;Once you enter a house, speak to the people there and say, &amp;quot;God&amp;quot;s blessing of peace be upon this house!&amp;quot;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">If a lover of peace resides there, your peace will rest upon that household. But if you are rejected, your blessing of peace will come back upon you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Don&amp;quot;t shift from one house to another, but stay in one home during your time in that city. Eat and drink whatever they serve you. Receive their hospitality, for you are my harvester, and you deserve to be cared for.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">&amp;apos;When you enter into a new town, and you have been welcomed by its people, follow these rules: Eat what is served you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Heal the sick, and tell them all, &amp;quot;God&amp;quot;s kingdom has arrived and is now within your reach!&amp;quot;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">But when you enter a city and they do not receive you, say to them publicly,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">&amp;quot;We wipe from our feet the very dust of your streets as a testimony before you! Understand this: God&amp;quot;s kingdom came within your reach and yet you have rejected God&amp;quot;s invitation!&amp;quot; &amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Jesus continued, &amp;apos;Let me say it clearly: on the day of judgment the wicked people of Sodom will have a lesser degree of judgment than the city that rejects you, for Sodom did not have the opportunity that was given to them .&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">&amp;apos;How disastrous it will be for the city of Korazin! How horrible for the city of Bethsaida! For if the powerful miracles that I performed in Korazin and Bethsaida had been done in Tyre and Sidon , they would have humbled themselves, repented, and turned from their sins.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Tyre and Sidon will face a lesser degree of judgment than you will on the day of judgment.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">And Capernaum! Do you really think you&amp;quot;ll be highly exalted because of the great things I have done there? No! You&amp;quot;ll be brought down to the depths of hell because of your rejection of me!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Jesus concluded his instructions to the seventy with these words: &amp;apos;Remember this: Whoever listens to your message is actually listening to me. And anyone who rejects you is rejecting me, and not only me but the one who sent me.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">When the seventy missionaries returned to Jesus, they were ecstatic with joy, telling him, &amp;apos;Lord, even the demons obeyed us when we commanded them in your name!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Jesus replied, &amp;apos; While you were ministering , I watched Satan topple until he fell suddenly from heaven like lightning to the ground.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Now you understand that I have imparted to you my authority to trample over his kingdom. You will trample upon every demon before you and overcome every power Satan possesses. Absolutely nothing will harm you as you walk in this authority.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">However, your real source of joy isn&amp;quot;t merely that these spirits submit to your authority, but that your names are written in the journals of heaven and that you belong to God&amp;quot;s kingdom. This is the true source of your authority.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Then Jesus, overflowing with the Holy Spirit&amp;quot;s joy, exclaimed, &amp;apos;Father, thank you, for you are Lord Supreme over heaven and earth! You have hidden the great revelation of this authority from those who are proud, those wise in their own eyes, and you have shared it with these who humbled themselves. Yes, Father. This is what pleases your heart: to give these things to those who are like trusting children.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">&amp;apos;Father, you have entrusted me with all that you have. No one fully knows the Son except the Father. And no one fully knows the Father except the Son. But the Son is able to reveal the Father to anyone he chooses.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">When Jesus was alone with the Twelve, he said to them, &amp;apos;You are privileged to see and hear all these things.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">Many kings and prophets of old longed to see these days of miracles that you&amp;quot;ve been favored to see. They would have given everything to hear the revelation you&amp;quot;ve been favored to hear. Yet they didn&amp;quot;t get to see a glimpse or hear even a whisper.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">Just then a religious scholar stood before Jesus in order to test his doctrines. He posed this question: &amp;apos;Teacher, what requirement must I fulfill if I want to live forever in heaven?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">Jesus replied, &amp;apos;What do you read in the Law? How do you understand it?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">The religious scholar answered, &amp;apos;It states, &amp;quot;You must love the Lord God with all your heart, all your passion, all your energy, and your every thought. And you must love your neighbor as yourself.&amp;quot; &amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">Jesus said, &amp;apos;That is correct. Now go and do exactly that and you will live.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">Wanting to justify himself, he questioned Jesus further, saying, &amp;apos;What do you mean by &amp;quot;my neighbor&amp;quot;?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">Jesus replied, &amp;apos;There was once a Jewish man traveling from Jerusalem to Jericho when bandits robbed him along the way. They beat him severely, stripped him naked, and left him half dead.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">&amp;apos;Soon, a Jewish priest walking down the same road came upon the wounded man. Seeing him from a distance, the priest crossed to the other side of the road and walked right past him, not turning to help him one bit.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">&amp;apos;Later, a religious man, a Levite, came walking down the same road and likewise crossed to the other side to pass by the wounded man without stopping to help him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">&amp;apos;Finally, another man, a Samaritan, came upon the bleeding man and was moved with tender compassion for him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">He stooped down and gave him first aid, pouring olive oil on his wounds, disinfecting them with wine, and bandaging them to stop the bleeding. Lifting him up, he placed him on his own donkey and brought him to an inn. Then he took him from his donkey and carried him to a room for the night.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">The next morning he took his own money from his wallet and gave it to the innkeeper with these words: &amp;quot;Take care of him until I come back from my journey. If it costs more than this, I will repay you when I return.&amp;quot;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">So, now, tell me, which one of the three men who saw the wounded man proved to be the true neighbor?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">The religious scholar responded, &amp;apos;The one who demonstrated kindness and mercy.&amp;apos; Jesus said, &amp;apos;Go and do the same as he.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">But Martha became exasperated with finishing the numerous household chores in preparation for her guests, so she interrupted Jesus and said, &amp;apos;Lord, don&amp;quot;t you think it&amp;quot;s unfair that my sister left me to do all the work by myself? You should tell her to get up and help me.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">The Lord answered her, &amp;apos;Martha, my beloved Martha. Why are you upset and troubled, pulled away by all these many distractions?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">Mary has discovered the one thing most important by choosing to sit at my feet. She is undistracted, and I won&amp;quot;t take this privilege from her.&amp;apos;</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="11">
			<VERS vnumber="1">One day, as Jesus was in prayer, one of his disciples came over to him as he finished and said, &amp;apos;Would you teach us a model prayer that we can pray, just as John did for his disciples?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">So Jesus taught them this prayer: &amp;apos;Our heavenly Father, may the glory of your name be the center on which our life turns. May your Holy Spirit come upon us and cleanse us. Manifest your kingdom on earth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">And give us our needed bread for the coming day.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Forgive our sins as we ourselves release forgiveness to those who have wronged us. And rescue us every time we face tribulations.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Then Jesus gave this illustration: &amp;apos;Imagine what would happen if you were to go to one of your friends in the middle of the night, pound on his door, and shout, &amp;quot;Please! Do you have some food you can spare?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">A friend just arrived at my house unexpectedly and I have nothing to serve him.&amp;quot;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">But your friend says, &amp;quot;Why are you bothering me? The door is locked and my family and I are all in bed. Do you expect me to get up and give you our food?&amp;quot;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">I tell you&amp;ndash;because of your shameless persistence, even though it&amp;quot;s the middle of the night, your friend will get up out of his bed and give you all that you need.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">&amp;apos;Let me ask you this: Do you know of any father who would give his son a snake on a plate when he asked for a serving of fish? Of course not!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Do you know of any father who would give his daughter a spider when she had asked for an egg? Of course not!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">If imperfect parents know how to lovingly take care of their children and give them what they need, how much more will the perfect heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit&amp;quot;s fullness when his children ask him.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">One day a crowd gathered around Jesus, and among them was a man who was mute. Jesus drove out of the man the spirit that made him unable to speak. When the demon left him, the mute man&amp;quot;s tongue was loosed and immediately he was able to speak. The stunned crowd saw it all and marveled in amazement over this miracle!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">But there were some in the crowd who protested, saying, &amp;apos;He casts out demons by the power of Satan, the demon king.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Others were skeptical and tried to persuade Jesus to perform a spectacular display of power to prove that he was the Messiah .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Jesus, well aware of their every thought, said to them, &amp;apos;Every kingdom that is split against itself is doomed to fail and will eventually collapse.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">If it is true that Satan casts out his own demons through me, how could his kingdom remain intact?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">If Satan gives me the power to cast out his demons, who is it that gives your exorcists their power? Let them become your judges! Go, ask them, and they will tell you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">But if I am casting out demons by God&amp;quot;s mighty power, God&amp;quot;s kingdom is now released upon you&amp;ndash; but you still reject it !</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">&amp;apos;When a strong man, with many weapons, guards his palace, his possessions are safe.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">But when one stronger than he comes to attack and overpower him, the stronger one will empty the arsenal in which he trusted. The conqueror will ransack his kingdom and distribute all the spoils of victory.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">Whoever is not on my side is against me, and whoever does not gather the spoils with me will be forever scattered.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">&amp;apos;When a demon is cast out of a person, it goes to wander in a waterless realm, searching for rest. But finding no place to rest, it says, &amp;quot;I will go back and reoccupy the body I left.&amp;quot;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">When it returns, it finds the person like a house swept clean and made tidy, but empty.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">Then it goes and enlists seven demons more evil than itself, and they all enter and possess the person, leaving that one in a much worse state than before.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">While he was saying all this, a woman shouted from the crowd, &amp;apos;God bless the one who gave you birth and nursed you as a child!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">&amp;apos;Yes,&amp;apos; said Jesus, &amp;apos;but God will bless all who listen to the word of God and carefully obey everything they hear.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">As the crowds continued to swell, Jesus went on to say, &amp;apos;How evil is this generation! When you demand a mighty display of power simply to prove who I am, you demonstrate your unbelief . The only sign you will see will be a repeat of the miracle of Jonah.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">In the same way Jonah became a sign to the people of Nineveh, so the Son of Man will be a sign to this generation.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">&amp;apos;The Queen of Sheba will rise up on the day of judgment to accuse and condemn this generation for its unbelief . She journeyed from a far and distant land just to listen to the wisdom of King Solomon. One greater than Solomon speaks with you today, but you refuse to listen.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">Yes, the people of Nineveh will also rise up on the day of judgment to accuse and condemn this generation. For they all repented when they heard the preaching of Jonah, but you refuse to repent. Yet there is one greater than Jonah who is preaching to you today.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">&amp;apos;No one would think of lighting a lamp and then hiding it in the basement where no one would benefit. A lamp belongs on a lampstand, where all who enter may see its light.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">The eyes of your spirit allow revelation-light to enter into your being. When your heart is open the light floods in. But when your heart is hard and closed, the light cannot penetrate and darkness takes its place.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">Open your heart and consider my words. Watch out that you do not mistake your opinions for revelation-light!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">If your spirit burns with light, fully illuminated with no trace of darkness, you will be a shining lamp, reflecting rays of truth by the way you live.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">The Lord said, &amp;apos;You Pharisees are like those who will wipe clean only the outside of a cup or bowl, leaving the inside filthy.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">You are foolish to ignore the greed and wickedness within you! Shouldn&amp;quot;t the one who cleans the outside also clean the inside?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">If you free your heart of greed, show compassion and true generosity to the poor, you will have more than clean hands; you will be clean within.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">&amp;apos;You Pharisees are hypocrites! For you are obsessed with peripheral issues , like paying meticulous tithes on the smallest herbs that grow in your gardens. Of course, these matters you should do, but when you unjustly cheat others, you ignore the most important duty of all: to walk in the love of God. Readjust your values and place first things first.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43">&amp;apos;You Pharisees are hypocrites! You love to be honored before others with titles of respect, seeking public recognition, aspiring to seem more important than others.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44">&amp;apos;You Pharisees, what hypocrites! Your true character is hidden, like an unmarked grave that hides the corruption inside, defiling all who come in contact with you.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45">Just then a specialist in interpreting religious law blurted out, &amp;apos;Teacher, don&amp;quot;t you realize that your words insult us?!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46">Jesus responded, &amp;apos;You are also hypocrites, you experts of the law! You crush people beneath the burden of obeying impossible religious regulations, yet you would never even think of doing them yourselves.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="47">What hypocrites! You build monuments to honor the prophets of old, yet it was your murdering ancestors who killed them. The only prophet you&amp;quot;ll honor is a dead one!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="48">In fact, by erecting monuments to the prophets your ancestors killed, you demonstrate your agreement with those murderers and bear witness to their deeds. You&amp;quot;re no better than they!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="49">That is why God&amp;quot;s wisdom is proclaiming: &amp;quot;I will send to them apostles and prophets though some they will murder and others they will persecute.&amp;quot;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="50">&amp;apos;God will hold this generation accountable for every drop of blood of every murdered prophet shed from the beginning of time until now,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="51">from the blood of Abel, who was killed by his brother, to the blood of Zechariah, who was murdered in the middle of the temple court. Yes, I tell you, you will be responsible for it all.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="52">&amp;apos;You are nothing but hypocrites, you experts of religion! You take away from others the key that opens the door to the house of knowledge. Not only do you lock the door and refuse to enter, but you also do your best to keep others from the truth.&amp;apos;</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="12">
			<VERS vnumber="1">By now a crowd of many thousands had gathered around Jesus. So many people pushed to be near him, they began to trample one another. Jesus turned to his disciples and warned them, &amp;apos;Beware of the hypocrisy of the Pharisees. It permeates everything they do and teach, like leaven.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Everything hidden and covered up will soon be exposed. For the facade is falling down, and nothing will be kept secret for long.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Whatever you have spoken in private will be public knowledge, and what you have whispered secretly behind closed doors will be broadcast far and wide for all to hear.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">&amp;apos;Listen, my beloved friends, don&amp;quot;t fear those who may want to take your life but can do nothing more. It&amp;quot;s true that they may kill your body, but they have no power over your soul.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">The one you must fear is God, for he has both the power to take your life and the authority to cast your soul into hell. Yes, the only one you need to fear is God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">&amp;apos;I can assure you of this: If you freely declare in public that I am the Son of Man, the Messiah, then I will freely declare to all the angels of God that you are mine.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">But if you publicly pretend that you don&amp;quot;t know me, I will deny you before the angels of God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">If anyone speaks evil of me, the Son of Man, that one can be forgiven. But if anyone speaks scornfully against the Holy Spirit, it will never be forgiven.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">And remember this: When people publicly accuse you and forcefully drag you before the religious leaders and authorities, do not be troubled. Don&amp;quot;t worry about defending yourself or how to answer their accusations.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Simply be confident and allow the Spirit of Wisdom access to your heart, and in that very moment he will reveal what you are to say to them.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Just then someone spoke up from the crowd and said, &amp;apos;Master, you should compel my older brother to divide the family inheritance and give me my fair share!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Jesus answered, &amp;apos;My friend, who made me a judge or arbitrator over you?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Speaking to the people, Jesus continued, &amp;apos;Be alert and guard your heart from greed and from always wishing for what you don&amp;quot;t have. For your life can never be measured by the amount of things you possess.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Jesus then gave them this illustration: &amp;apos;A wealthy land owner had a farm that produced bumper crops. Every year the harvest was so great it filled his barns to overflowing!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">He thought, &amp;quot;What should I do now that every barn is full and I have nowhere else to store more?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">I know what I&amp;quot;ll do! I&amp;quot;ll tear down the barns and build one massive barn to hold all my grain and goods.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Then I can just sit back, surrounded with comfort and ease. I&amp;quot;ll enjoy life with no worries at all.&amp;quot;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">&amp;apos;God said to him, &amp;quot;What a fool you are to trust in your riches and not in me! This very night the messengers of death will demand to take your life. Then who will get all the wealth you have stored up for yourself?&amp;quot;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">The same thing will happen to all those who fill up their lives with everything but God.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Jesus taught his disciples, saying, &amp;apos;Listen to me. Never let anxiety enter your hearts. Never worry about any of your needs, such as food or clothing.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">For your life is infinitely more than just the food you eat or the clothing you wear.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">Take the carefree birds as your example. Do you ever see them worry? They neither grow their own food nor put it in a storehouse for later. Yet God takes care of every one of them, feeding each of them out of the abundance of his love and goodness. Isn&amp;quot;t your life more precious to God than a bird? Be carefree in the care of God!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">&amp;apos;Does worry add anything to your life? Can it add one more year, or even one day?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">So if worrying adds nothing, but actually subtracts from your life, why would you worry about God&amp;quot;s care of you?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">&amp;apos;Think about the lilies. They grow and become beautiful, not because they work hard or strive to clothe themselves. Yet not even Solomon, wearing his kingly garments of splendor, could be compared to a field of lilies.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">If God can clothe the fields and meadows with grass and flowers, can he not clothe you as well, O struggling one with so many doubts?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">I repeat: Don&amp;quot;t let worry enter your life. Live above the anxious cares about your personal needs.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">People everywhere seem to worry about making a living, but your heavenly Father knows your every need and will take care of you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">As you passionately seek his kingdom, above all else, he will supply your needs.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">So don&amp;quot;t ever be afraid, dearest friends! Your loving Father joyously gives you his kingdom with all its promises!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">&amp;apos;Now, go and sell what you have and give to those in need; you will be making deposits in your account in heaven, an account that will never be taken from you. Your gifts will become a secure and unfailing treasure, deposited in heaven forever.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">Where you deposit your treasure, that is where you fix your thoughts&amp;ndash;and your heart will long to be there also.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">&amp;apos;Be prepared for action at a moment&amp;quot;s notice.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">Be like servants anticipating their master&amp;quot;s return from a wedding celebration. They are ready at a moment&amp;quot;s notice to unlock and open the door for him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">What great joy is ahead for those who stay awake and wait for their Master&amp;quot;s return! He himself will become their servant and wait on them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">He may appear at midnight or even later, but what great joy for the awakened ones whenever he comes!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">Of course, if they knew ahead of time the hour of their master&amp;quot;s appearing, they would be alert, just as they would be ready if they knew ahead of time that a thief was coming to break into their house.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">So keep being alert and ready at all times. For I promise you that the Son of Man will surprise you and appear when you don&amp;quot;t expect him.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">&amp;apos;Lord,&amp;apos; Peter asked, &amp;apos;does this apply only to the twelve of us, or is it for everyone else as well?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">The Lord replied, &amp;apos;A master will delegate authority in his house to a trustworthy and thoughtful manager who understands his master&amp;quot;s desires. And the household manager will serve others what they need at exactly the right time.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45">&amp;apos;But what if that servant says in his heart, &amp;quot;My master delays his coming, and who knows when he will return?&amp;quot; Because of the delay, the servant elevates himself and mistreats those in his master&amp;quot;s household. Instead of caring for the ones he was appointed to serve, he abuses the other servants, both men and women. He throws drunken parties for his friends and gives himself over to every pleasure.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46">Let me tell you what will happen to him. His master will suddenly return at a time that shocks him, and he will remove the abusive, selfish servant from his position of trust. The master will punish him and assign him a portion with the unbelievers.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="47">&amp;apos;Every servant who knows what pleases his master yet does not make himself ready and refuses to put his master&amp;quot;s will to action will receive many punishing blows.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="48">Every servant who does not know his master&amp;quot;s will and unwittingly does what is wrong will receive a less severe punishment. For those who have received a greater revelation from their master are required a greater obedience. And those who have been entrusted with great responsibility will be held more responsible to their master.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="49">&amp;apos;I have come to set the earth on fire, and how I wish it were already ablaze with fiery passion for God!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="50">But first I must be immersed into the baptism of God&amp;quot;s judgment, and I am consumed with passion as I await its fulfillment.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="51">Don&amp;quot;t think for a moment that I came to grant peace and harmony to everyone. No, my arrival will change everything and create hostility among you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="52">From now on, even family members will be divided over me and will choose sides one against another.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="53">Fathers will be divided from sons and sons from fathers; mothers will be divided from daughters and daughters from mothers; mothers-in-law will be against brides and brides against mothers-in-law&amp;ndash;all because of me.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="54">Jesus then said to the crowds gathered around him, &amp;apos;When you see a cloud forming in the west, don&amp;quot;t you say, &amp;quot;A storm is brewing&amp;quot;? And then it arrives.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="55">And when you feel the south wind blowing, you say, &amp;quot;A heat wave is on the way.&amp;quot; And so it happens.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="56">What hypocrites! You are such experts at forecasting the weather, but you are totally unwilling to understand the spiritual significance of the time you&amp;quot;re living in.</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="13">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Some of those in the crowd informed Jesus that Pilate had slaughtered some Galilean Jews while they were offering sacrifices at the temple, mixing their blood with the sacrifices they were offering.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Jesus turned and asked them, &amp;apos;Do you believe that the slaughtered Galileans were the worst sinners of all the Galileans?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">No, they weren&amp;quot;t! So listen to me, unless you all repent, you will perish as they did.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">What about the eighteen who perished when the tower of Siloam fell upon them? Do you really think that they were more guilty than all of the others in Jerusalem?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">No, they weren&amp;quot;t, and unless you repent, you too will all eternally perish, just as they did.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Then Jesus told them this parable: &amp;apos;There was a man who planted a fig tree in his orchard. But every time he came to gather fruit from his tree he found none, for it was barren.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">So he said to his gardener, &amp;quot;For the last three years I&amp;quot;ve come to gather figs from my tree but it remains fruitless. What a waste! Go ahead and cut it down!&amp;quot;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">&amp;apos;But the gardener protested, &amp;quot;Sir, we should leave it one more year. Let me fertilize and cultivate it, then let&amp;quot;s see if it will produce fruit.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">If it doesn&amp;quot;t bear figs by next year, we&amp;quot;ll cut it down.&amp;quot; &amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">One Sabbath day, while Jesus was teaching in the synagogue,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">he encountered a seriously handicapped woman. She was crippled and had been doubled over for eighteen years. Her condition was caused by a demonic spirit of bondage that had left her unable to stand up straight.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">The Jewish leader who was in charge of the synagogue was infuriated over Jesus healing on the Sabbath day. &amp;apos;Six days you are to work,&amp;apos; he shouted angrily to the crowd. &amp;apos;On those days you should come here for healing, but not on the seventh day!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">The Lord replied, &amp;apos;You hypocrites! Don&amp;quot;t you care for your animals on the Sabbath, untying your ox or donkey from the stall and leading it away to water?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">If you do this for your animals, what&amp;quot;s wrong with allowing this beloved daughter of Abraham, who has been bound by Satan for eighteen long years, to be untied and set free on a Sabbath day?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">When they heard this, his critics were completely humiliated. But the crowds shouted with joy over the glorious things Jesus was doing among them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Jesus taught them this parable: &amp;apos;How can I describe God&amp;quot;s kingdom?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">God&amp;quot;s kingdom is like the smallest seed that one might plant in a garden. When it grows, it becomes a huge tree, with so many spreading branches that various birds make nests there.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Jesus taught them another parable: &amp;apos;How can I describe God&amp;quot;s kingdom?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">God&amp;quot;s kingdom is like something as small as yeast that a woman kneads into a large amount of dough. It works unseen until it permeates the entire batch and the loaf rises high.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Jesus ministered from village to village, making his way to Jerusalem and teaching the people as he went.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">A bystander asked him, &amp;apos;Lord, will only a few have eternal life?&amp;apos; Jesus said to the crowd,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">&amp;apos;There is a great cost for anyone to enter through the narrow doorway into God&amp;quot;s kingdom. I tell you, many will want to enter but won&amp;quot;t be able to.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">Once the head of the house has shut and locked the door, it will be too late. Even if you stand outside knocking, begging to enter, and saying, &amp;quot;Lord, Lord, open the door for us,&amp;quot; he will say to you, &amp;quot;I don&amp;quot;t know who you are. You are not a part of my family .&amp;quot;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">&amp;apos;Then you will reply, &amp;quot;But Lord, we dined with you and walked with you as you taught us.&amp;quot;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">And he will reply, &amp;quot;Don&amp;quot;t you understand? I don&amp;quot;t know who you are, for you are not a part of my family. I will not let you in. Now, go away from me! For you are all disloyal to me and do evil.&amp;quot;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">&amp;apos;You will experience great weeping and great anguish when you see Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, along with all the prophets of Israel, enjoying God&amp;quot;s kingdom while you yourselves are barred from entering.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">You will see people streaming from the four corners of the earth, accepting the invitation to feast in God&amp;quot;s kingdom realm, while you are outside looking in.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">And take note of this: Some are despised and viewed as the least important now, but one day the master will place them at the head of the line. And some whom you view as &amp;quot;elite&amp;quot; today will become the least important then.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">Just then some Jewish religious leaders came to Jesus to urge him to flee from that place because Herod was out to kill him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">Jesus told them, &amp;apos;Go and tell that deceiver that I will continue to cast out demons and heal the sick today and tomorrow, and on the third day I will bring my work to perfection.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">For everyone knows I am safe until I come to Jerusalem, for that is where all the prophets have been killed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">O City of Jerusalem, you are the city who murders your prophets! You are the city who pelts to death with stones the very messengers sent to deliver you! So many times I have longed to gather your wayward children together around me, as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings&amp;ndash;but you were too stubborn to let me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">Now it is too late, since your house will be left in ruins. You will not see me again until you are able to say, &amp;quot;We welcome the one who comes to us sent in the name of the Lord.&amp;quot; &amp;apos;</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="14">
			<VERS vnumber="1">One Sabbath, Jesus was on his way to dine with a prominent Jewish religious leader for a festive meal. Everyone was watching him to see if he would heal anyone on the Sabbath.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Just then, standing right in front of him was a man with his limbs suffering from edema.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Jesus asked the experts of the law and the Pharisees who were present, &amp;apos;Does the law permit a man to heal on the Sabbath day? Is it right or wrong?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">No one dared answer, so Jesus turned to the sick man, released healing to him, and sent him on his way.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Jesus said to them all, &amp;apos;If one of your children or one of your animals fell into a well, wouldn&amp;quot;t you do all you could to rescue them even on the Sabbath?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">There was nothing they could say&amp;ndash;all were silenced.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">When Jesus noticed how the guests for the meal were all vying for the seats of honor, he shared this story with the guests around the table:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">&amp;apos;When you are invited to an important social function, don&amp;quot;t be quick to sit near the head of the table, choosing for yourself a seat of honor. What will happen to you when someone arrives who is more distinguished than you?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">The host will bring him over to where you are sitting and ask for your seat, saying in front of all the guests, &amp;quot;You&amp;quot;re in the wrong place. Please give this person your seat.&amp;quot; Disgraced, you will have to take whatever seat is left.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Instead, when you&amp;quot;re invited to a banquet, you should choose to sit in the lowest place. When your host comes and sees you there, he may say, &amp;quot;My friend, come with me and let me seat you in a better place.&amp;quot; Then, in front of all the other guests at the banquet, he will honor you by seating you in the place of highest respect.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">&amp;apos;Remember this: everyone with a lofty opinion of who he is and who seeks to raise himself up will be publicly humbled. And everyone with a modest opinion of who he is and chooses to humble himself will be raised up before all.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Then Jesus turned to his host and said, &amp;apos;When you throw a banquet, don&amp;quot;t just invite your friends, relatives, or rich neighbors&amp;ndash;for it is likely they will return the favor.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">When they heard this, one of the dinner guests said to Jesus, &amp;apos;Someday God will have a kingdom feast, and how happy and privileged will be the ones who get to share in that joy!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Jesus replied with this parable: &amp;apos;A man invited many to join him in a great feast.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">When the day for the feast arrived, the host instructed his servant to notify all the invited guests and tell them, &amp;quot;Come, for everything is now ready for you!&amp;quot;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">But one by one they all made excuses. One said, &amp;quot;I can&amp;quot;t come. I just bought some property and I have to go and look it over.&amp;quot;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Another said, &amp;quot;Please accept my regrets, for I just purchased five teams of oxen and I need to make sure they can pull the plow.&amp;quot;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Another one said, &amp;quot;I can&amp;quot;t come because I just got married.&amp;quot;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">&amp;apos;The servant reported back to the host and told him of all their excuses. The master became angry and said to his servant, &amp;quot;Go at once throughout the city and invite anyone you find&amp;ndash;the poor, the blind, the disabled, the hurting, and the lonely. Invite them to my banquet.&amp;quot;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">&amp;apos;When the servant returned to his master, he said, &amp;quot;Sir, I have done what you asked, but there&amp;quot;s still room for more.&amp;quot;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">&amp;apos;So the master told him, &amp;quot;All right. Go out again, and this time bring them all back with you. Persuade the beggars on the streets, the outcasts, even the homeless. Insist that they come in and enjoy the feast so that my house will be full.&amp;quot;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">&amp;apos;I say to you all, no one who receives an invitation to feast with me and makes excuses will ever enjoy my banquet.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">As massive crowds followed Jesus, he turned to them and said,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">&amp;apos;When you follow me as my disciple, you must put aside your father, your mother, your wife, your sisters, your brothers; it will even seem as though you hate your own life. This is the price you&amp;quot;ll pay to be considered one of my followers.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">Anyone who comes to me must be willing to share my cross and experience it as his own, or he cannot be considered to be my disciple.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">So don&amp;quot;t follow me without considering what it will cost you. For who would construct a house before first sitting down to estimate the cost to complete it?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">Otherwise he may lay the foundation and not be able to finish. The neighbors will ridicule him, saying,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">&amp;quot;Look at him! He started to build but couldn&amp;quot;t complete it!&amp;quot;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">&amp;apos;Have you ever heard of a commander who goes out to war without first sitting down with strategic planning to determine the strength of his army to win the war against a stronger opponent?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">If he knows he doesn&amp;quot;t stand a chance of winning the war, the wise commander will send out delegates to ask for the terms of peace.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">Likewise, unless you surrender all to me, giving up all you possess, you cannot be one of my disciples.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">&amp;apos;Salt is good for seasoning. But if salt were to lose its flavor, how could it ever be restored?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">It will never be useful again, not even fit for the soil or the manure pile! If you have ears opened by the Spirit, then hear the meaning of what I have said and apply it to yourselves .&amp;apos;</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="15">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Many dishonest tax collectors and other notorious sinners often gathered around to listen as Jesus taught the people.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">This raised concerns among the Jewish religious leaders and experts of the law. Indignant, they grumbled and complained, saying, &amp;apos;Look at how this man associates with all these notorious sinners and welcomes them all to come to him!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">In response, Jesus gave them this illustration:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Returning home, he called all his friends and neighbors together and said, &amp;quot;Let&amp;quot;s have a party! Come and celebrate with me the return of my lost lamb. It wandered away, but I found it and brought it home.&amp;quot; &amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Jesus continued, &amp;apos;In the same way, there will be a glorious celebration in heaven over the rescue of one lost sinner who repents, comes back home, and returns to the fold&amp;ndash;more so than for all the righteous people who never strayed away.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Jesus gave them another parable: &amp;apos;There once was a woman who had ten valuable silver coins. When she lost one of them, she swept her entire house, diligently searching every nook and cranny for that one lost coin.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">When she finally found it, she gathered all her friends and neighbors for a celebration, telling them, &amp;quot;Come and celebrate with me! I had lost my precious silver coin, but now I&amp;quot;ve found it.&amp;quot;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">That&amp;quot;s the way God responds every time one lost sinner repents and turns to him. He says to all his angels, &amp;quot;Let&amp;quot;s have a joyous celebration, for the one who was lost, I have found!&amp;quot; &amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Then Jesus said, &amp;apos;Once there was a father with two sons.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">The younger son came to his father and said, &amp;quot;Father, don&amp;quot;t you think it&amp;quot;s time to give me my share of your estate?&amp;quot; So the father went ahead and distributed between the two sons their inheritance.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Shortly afterward, the younger son packed up all his belongings and traveled off to see the world. He journeyed to a far-off land where he soon wasted all he was given in a binge of extravagant and reckless living.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">&amp;apos;With everything spent and nothing left, he grew hungry, because there was a severe famine in that land.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">So he begged a farmer in that country to hire him. The farmer hired him and sent him out to feed the pigs.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">The son was so famished, he was willing even to eat the slop given to the pigs, because no one would feed him a thing.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">&amp;apos;Humiliated, the son finally realized what he was doing, and he thought, &amp;quot;There are many workers at my father&amp;quot;s house who have all the food they want with plenty to spare. They lack nothing. Why am I here dying of hunger, feeding these pigs and eating their slop?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">I want to go back home to my father&amp;quot;s house, and I&amp;quot;ll say to him, &amp;apos;Father, I was wrong. I have sinned against you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">I&amp;quot;ll never again be worthy to be called your son. Please, Father, just treat me like one of your employees.&amp;apos; &amp;quot;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">&amp;apos;So the young son set off for home. From a long distance away, his father saw him coming, dressed as a beggar, and great compassion swelled up in his heart for his son who was returning home. The father raced out to meet him, swept him up in his arms, hugged him dearly, and kissed him over and over with tender love.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">&amp;apos;Then the son said, &amp;quot;Father, I was wrong. I have sinned against you. I could never deserve to be called your son. Just let me be&amp;ndash;&amp;quot; &amp;apos;The father interrupted and said, &amp;quot;Son, you&amp;quot;re home now!&amp;quot;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">&amp;apos;Turning to his servants, the father said, &amp;quot;Quick, bring me the best robe, my very own robe, and I will place it on his shoulders. Bring the ring, the seal of sonship, and I will put it on his finger. And bring out the best shoes you can find for my son.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">Let&amp;quot;s prepare a great feast and celebrate.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">For my beloved son was once dead, but now he&amp;quot;s alive! Once he was lost, but now he is found!&amp;quot; And everyone celebrated with overflowing joy.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">&amp;apos;Now, the older son was out working in the field when his brother returned, and as he approached the house, he heard the music of celebration and dancing.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">He called over one of the servants and asked, &amp;quot;What&amp;quot;s going on?&amp;quot;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">&amp;apos;The servant replied, &amp;quot;It&amp;quot;s your younger brother. He&amp;quot;s returned home and your father is throwing a party to celebrate his homecoming.&amp;quot;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">&amp;apos;The older son became angry and refused to go in and celebrate. So his father came out and pleaded with him, &amp;quot;Come and enjoy the feast with us!&amp;quot;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">&amp;apos;The son said, &amp;quot;Father, listen! How many years have I worked like a slave for you, performing every duty you&amp;quot;ve asked as a faithful son? And I&amp;quot;ve never once disobeyed you. But you&amp;quot;ve never thrown a party for me because of my faithfulness. Never once have you even given me a goat that I could feast on and celebrate with my friends as this son of yours is doing now.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">Look at him! He comes back after wasting your wealth on prostitutes and reckless living, and here you are throwing a great feast to celebrate&amp;ndash;for him!&amp;quot;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">&amp;apos;The father said, &amp;quot;My son, you are always with me by my side. Everything I have is yours to enjoy.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">It&amp;quot;s only right to rejoice and celebrate like this, because your brother was once dead and gone, but now he is alive and back with us again. He was lost, but now he is found!&amp;quot; &amp;apos;</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="16">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Jesus taught his disciples using this story: &amp;apos;Once a very rich man hired a manager to run his business and oversee all his wealth. But soon a rumor spread that the manager was wasting his master&amp;quot;s money. Jesus continued, &amp;apos;Remember this: The sons of darkness interact more wisely than the sons of light.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">So the master called him in and said, &amp;quot;Is it true that you are mismanaging my estate? You need to provide me with a complete audit of everything you oversee for me. I&amp;quot;ve decided to dismiss you.&amp;quot;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">&amp;apos;The manager thought, &amp;quot;Now what am I going to do? I&amp;quot;m finished here. I can&amp;quot;t hide what I&amp;quot;ve done, and I&amp;quot;m too proud to beg.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">I have an idea that will secure my future. It will win me favor and secure friends who can take care of me and help me when I get fired!&amp;quot;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">&amp;apos;So the dishonest manager hatched his scheme. He went to everyone who owed his master money, one by one, and asked them, &amp;quot;How much do you owe my master?&amp;quot;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">&amp;apos;Even though his master was defrauded, when he found out about the shrewd way this manager had feathered his own nest, he congratulated the clever scoundrel for what he&amp;quot;d done to provide for his future.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Use the wealth of this world to demonstrate your friendship with God by winning friends and blessing others. Then, when it runs out, your generosity will provide you with an eternal reward.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">&amp;apos;The one who faithfully manages the little he has been given will be promoted and trusted with greater responsibilities. But those who cheat with the little they have been given will not be considered trustworthy to receive more.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">If you have not handled the riches of this world with integrity, why should you be trusted with the eternal treasures of the spiritual world?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">And if you&amp;quot;ve not proven yourself faithful with what belongs to another, why should you be given wealth of your own?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">It is impossible for a person to serve two masters at the same time. You will be forced to love one and reject the other. One master will be despised and the other will have your loyal devotion. Your choice between God and the wealth of this world is no different. You must enthusiastically love one and definitively reject the other.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Now, the Jewish religious leaders listening to Jesus were lovers of money. They laughed at what he said and mocked his teachings,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">so Jesus addressed them directly. &amp;apos;You always want to look spiritual in the eyes of others, but you have forgotten the eyes of God, which see what is inside you. The very things that you approve of and applaud are the things God despises.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">The law of Moses and the revelation of the prophets have prepared you for the arrival of the kingdom announced by John. Since that time, the wonderful news of God&amp;quot;s kingdom is being preached, and people&amp;quot;s hearts burn with extreme passion to receive it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Heaven and earth will disintegrate before even the smallest detail of the Law will fail or lose its power.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">&amp;apos;It is wrong for you to divorce your wife so that you can marry another&amp;ndash;that is adultery. And when you take that one you lusted after as your wife, and contribute to the breakup of her marriage, you commit adultery again.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Jesus continued. &amp;apos;There once was a very rich man who had the finest things imaginable, living every day enjoying his life of opulent luxury.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">&amp;apos;One day poor Lazarus died, and the angels of God came and escorted his spirit into paradise.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">&amp;apos;The day came that the rich man also died. In hell he looked up from his torment and saw Abraham in the distance, and Lazarus was standing beside him in the glory.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">The rich man shouted, &amp;quot;Father Abraham! Father Abraham! Have mercy on me. Send Lazarus to dip his finger in water and come to cool my tongue, for I am in agony in these flames of fire!&amp;quot;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">&amp;apos;But Abraham responded, &amp;quot;My friend, don&amp;quot;t you remember? While you were alive, you had all you desired. You surrounded yourself in luxury, while Lazarus had nothing. Now Lazarus dwells in the comforts of paradise and you are in agony.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">Besides, between us is a huge chasm that cannot be bridged, nor can anyone cross from one realm to the other, even if he wanted.&amp;quot;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">&amp;apos;The rich man continued, &amp;quot;Then let me ask you, Father Abraham, please send Lazarus to my relatives.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">Tell him to witness to my five brothers and warn them not to end up where I am in this place of torment.&amp;quot;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">&amp;apos;Abraham replied, &amp;quot;They&amp;quot;ve already had plenty of warning. They have the teachings of Moses and the revelation of the prophets; let them hear them.&amp;quot;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">&amp;apos; &amp;quot;What if they&amp;quot;re not listening?&amp;quot; the rich man added. &amp;quot;If someone from the dead were to go and warn them, they would surely repent.&amp;quot;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">&amp;apos;Abraham said to him, &amp;quot;If they wouldn&amp;quot;t listen to Moses and the prophets, neither would they be convinced if someone were raised from the dead!&amp;quot; &amp;apos;</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="17">
			<VERS vnumber="1">One day Jesus taught his disciples: &amp;apos;Betrayals are inevitable, but great devastation will come to the one guilty of betraying others.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">It would be better for him to have a heavy boulder tied around his neck and be hurled into the deepest sea than to face the punishment of betraying one of my dear ones! So be alert to your brother&amp;quot;s condition,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">and if you see him going the wrong direction, cry out and correct him. If there is true repentance on his part, forgive him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">No matter how many times in one day your brother sins against you and says, &amp;quot;I&amp;quot;m sorry; I am changing; forgive me,&amp;quot; you need to forgive him each and every time.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Upon hearing this, the apostles said to Jesus, &amp;apos;Lord, you must increase our measure of faith!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Jesus responded, &amp;apos;If you have even the smallest measure of faith, it would be powerful enough to say to this large tree, &amp;quot;My faith will pull you up by the roots and throw you into the sea,&amp;quot; and it will respond to your faith and obey you.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Does the servant expect to be thanked for doing what is required of him?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">So learn this lesson: After doing all that is commanded of you, simply say, &amp;quot;We are mere servants, undeserving of special praise, for we are just doing what is expected of us and fulfilling our duties.&amp;quot; &amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">On his way to Jerusalem Jesus passed through the border region between Samaria and Galilee.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">As he entered one village, ten men approached him, but they kept their distance, for they were lepers.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">They shouted to him, &amp;apos;Mighty Lord, our wonderful Master! Won&amp;quot;t you have mercy on us and heal us ?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">When Jesus stopped to look at them, he spoke these words: &amp;apos;Go to be examined by the Jewish priests.&amp;apos; They set off, and they were healed while walking along the way.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">One of them, a Samaritan , when he discovered that he was completely healed, turned back to find Jesus, shouting out joyous praises and glorifying God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">When he found Jesus, he fell down at his feet and thanked him over and over, saying to him, &amp;apos;You are the Messiah.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">&amp;apos;So where are the other nine?&amp;apos; Jesus asked. &amp;apos;Weren&amp;quot;t there ten who were healed?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">They all refused to return to give thanks and give glory to God except you, a foreigner from Samaria?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Then Jesus said to the healed man lying at his feet, &amp;apos;Arise and go. It was your faith that brought you salvation and made you whole.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Jesus was once asked by the Jewish religious leaders, &amp;apos;When will God&amp;quot;s kingdom come?&amp;apos; Jesus responded, &amp;apos;God&amp;quot;s kingdom does not come simply by obeying principles or waiting for signs. Jesus responded, &amp;apos; It will be obvious , for wherever there are those spiritually dead, there you will find the eagles circling.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">The kingdom is not discovered in one place or another, for God&amp;quot;s kingdom realm is already expanding within some of you.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Later, Jesus addressed this again with his apostles, saying, &amp;apos;The time is coming when a great passion will be awakened within you to see me again. Yes, you will long to see the beginning of the days of the Son of Man, but you won&amp;quot;t be able to find me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">You will hear reports from some who will say, &amp;quot;Look, he has returned,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;He&amp;quot;s over here,&amp;quot; or, &amp;quot;He&amp;quot;s over there!&amp;quot; Don&amp;quot;t believe it or run after them, for their claims will be false.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">The day of the Son of Man will burst forth with the brightness of a lightning strike that shines from one end of the sky to the other, illuminating the earth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">&amp;apos;But before this takes place, the Son of Man must pass through great suffering and rejection from this generation.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">The same things that happened in the days of Noah will take place in the days of the Son of Man.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">They were eating, they were drinking, they were marrying, and they were given in marriage until the day Noah boarded the ark and the devastating flood came and swept them all away.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">&amp;apos;On that day, if one is outside, he won&amp;quot;t even have time to go back into the house to gather his belongings. And those toiling in their fields won&amp;quot;t have time to run back home.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">Don&amp;quot;t forget the example of Lot&amp;quot;s wife and what happened to her when she turned back.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">All who are obsessed with being secure in life will lose it all&amp;ndash;including their lives. But those who let go of their lives and surrender them to me will discover true life.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">For in that night there will be two lying in their bed; one will be suddenly swept away while the other will be left alive .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">His apostles asked, &amp;apos;Lord, where will this judgment happen?&amp;apos;</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="18">
			<VERS vnumber="1">One day Jesus taught the apostles to keep praying and never stop or lose hope. He shared with them this illustration:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">&amp;apos;In a certain town there was a judge, a thick-skinned and godless man who had no fear of others&amp;quot; opinions.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">And in the same town there was a poor widow who kept pleading with the judge, &amp;quot;Grant me justice and protect me from my oppressor!&amp;quot;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Jesus continued, &amp;apos;Did you hear what the godless judge said&amp;ndash;that he would answer her persistent request?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Don&amp;quot;t you know that God, the true judge, will grant justice to all his chosen ones who cry out to him night and day? He will pour out his Spirit upon them. He will not delay to answer you and give you what you ask for.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">God will give swift justice to those who don&amp;quot;t give up. So be ever praying, ever expecting, in the same way as the widow. Even so, when the Son of Man comes back, will he find this kind of undying faith on earth?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Jesus taught this parable to those who were convinced they were morally upright and to those who trusted in their own virtue yet looked down on others with disgust:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">&amp;apos;Two men who went into the temple to pray. One was a proud religious leader, the other a despised tax collector.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">&amp;apos;The tax collector stood alone in a corner, away from the Holy Place , and covered his face in his hands, feeling that he was unworthy even to look up to God. Beating his breast, he sobbed with brokenness and tears saying, &amp;quot;God, please, in your mercy and because of the blood sacrifice, forgive me, for I am nothing but the most miserable of all sinners!&amp;quot;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">&amp;apos;Which one of them left for home that day reconciled to God? The humble tax collector, not the religious leader! For everyone who praises himself will one day be publicly humiliated, and everyone who humbles himself will one day be publicly honored and lifted up.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">The people brought their babies and small children to Jesus so that he might lay his hands on them to bless them. When the disciples saw this, they scolded the parents and told them to stop troubling the Master.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Seeing what was happening, Jesus called for the parents, the children, and his disciples to come and listen to him. Then he told them, &amp;apos;Never hinder a child from coming to me but let them all come, for God&amp;quot;s kingdom belongs to them as much as it does to anyone else. These children demonstrate to you what faith is all about.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Learn this well: unless you receive the revelation of the kingdom the same way a little child receives it, you will never be able to enter in.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">One day a wealthy Jewish nobleman of high standing posed this question to Jesus: &amp;apos;Wonderful Teacher, what must I do to receive eternal life?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Jesus answered, &amp;apos;Why would you call me wonderful when there is only one who is wonderful&amp;ndash;and that is God alone?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">You already know what is right and what the commandments teach: &amp;quot;Do not commit adultery, do not murder, do not steal, do not lie, and honor your father and your mother.&amp;quot; &amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">The wealthy leader replied, &amp;apos;These are the very things I&amp;quot;ve been doing for as long as I can remember.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">&amp;apos;Ah,&amp;apos; Jesus said, &amp;apos;there&amp;quot;s still one thing you&amp;quot;re missing in your life.&amp;apos; &amp;apos;What is that?&amp;apos; asked the man. &amp;apos;Master,&amp;apos; he said, &amp;apos;please, I want to see.&amp;apos; &amp;apos;You must go and sell everything you own and give all the proceeds to the poor so you will have eternal treasures. Then come and follow me.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">These words devastated the rich leader, for he was extremely wealthy.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">Jesus saw his disappointment, and looking right at him said, &amp;apos;It is next to impossible for those who have everything to enter into God&amp;quot;s kingdom.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">Nothing could be harder! You could compare it to trying to stuff a rope through the eye of a needle.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">Those who heard this said, &amp;apos;Then who can be saved?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">Jesus responded, &amp;apos;What appears humanly impossible is more than possible with God. For God can do what man cannot.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">Peter said, &amp;apos;Master, see how we&amp;quot;ve left all that we have, our houses and our careers, to follow you.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">Jesus took the Twelve aside and told them in private, &amp;apos;We are going to Jerusalem so that everything prophesied about the Son of Man will be fulfilled.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">They will betray him and hand him over to the people, and they will mock him, insult him, and spit in his face.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">And after they have abused and flogged the Son of Man, they will kill him. But in three days he will rise again.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">The disciples had no clue what he was saying, for his words were a mystery that was hidden from them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">As Jesus and his followers arrived at Jericho, a blind beggar was sitting by the roadside.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">When he heard the crowd approaching, he asked, &amp;apos;What&amp;quot;s all this commotion about?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">&amp;apos;It&amp;quot;s Jesus!&amp;apos; they said. &amp;apos;Jesus the Nazarene is passing by.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">The blind beggar shouted, &amp;apos;Jesus, Son of David, have pity and show me mercy!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">Those in the front of the crowd scolded him and warned him to be quiet, but the blind beggar screamed out even louder, &amp;apos;Jesus, Son of David, show me mercy!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">Suddenly Jesus stopped and directed those nearby, &amp;apos;Bring the man over to me.&amp;apos; When they brought him before Jesus, he asked the man,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">&amp;apos;What do you want me to do for you?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">Jesus said, &amp;apos;Now you will see. Receive your sight this moment, for your faith in me has given you sight and new life.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43">Instantly he could see again. His eyes popped open, and he saw Jesus standing in front of him ! He shouted loud praises to God and he followed Jesus. And when the crowd saw what happened, they too erupted with shouts of praise to God.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="19">
			<VERS vnumber="1">On his way to Jerusalem , Jesus had to pass through Jericho.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">There lived a very wealthy man named Zacchaeus, who supervised all the tax collectors.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">He was very eager to see Jesus and kept trying to get a look at him through the massive crowd. Since Zacchaeus was a short man and couldn&amp;quot;t see over the heads of the people,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">he ran on ahead of everyone and climbed up a blossoming fig tree to get a glimpse of Jesus as he passed by.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">When Jesus got to that place, he looked up into the tree and said, &amp;apos;Zacchaeus, hurry on down, for I must stay at your house today!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">So he scurried down the tree and found himself face-to-face with Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">As Jesus left to go with Zacchaeus, many in the crowd complained, &amp;apos;Look at this! Of all the people to have dinner with, he&amp;quot;s going to eat in the house of a crook.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Zacchaeus was amazed over his gracious visit to his home and joyously welcomed Jesus. Zacchaeus stood in front of the Lord and said, &amp;apos;Half of all that I own I will give to the poor. And Lord, if I have cheated anyone, I promise to pay them back four times as much as I stole.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Jesus said to him, &amp;apos;Your repentance shows that today life has come to you and your household, and that you are a true son of Abraham.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">The Son of Man has come to seek out and to give life to those who are lost.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">At this time Jesus was getting close to entering Jerusalem. The crowds that followed him were convinced that God&amp;quot;s kingdom would fully manifest when Jesus established it in Jerusalem.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">So he told them this story to change their perspective: &amp;apos;Once a wealthy prince left his province to travel to a distant land, where he would be crowned king and then return.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Before he departed he summoned his ten servants together and charged them, &amp;quot;I am entrusting each of you with fifty thousand dollars to invest while I am away. Trade with it and put the money to work until I return.&amp;quot;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">&amp;apos;Some of his countrymen despised the prince and sent a delegation after him to declare before the royals, &amp;quot;We refuse to let this man rule over us! He will not be our king!&amp;quot;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">&amp;apos;Nevertheless, he was crowned king and returned to his land. Then he summoned his ten servants to see how much each one had earned and what their profits came to.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">&amp;apos;The first one came forward and said, &amp;quot;Master, I took what you gave me and invested it, and it multiplied ten times.&amp;quot;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">&amp;apos; &amp;quot;Splendid! You have done well, my excellent servant. Because you have shown that I can trust you in this small matter, I now grant you authority to rule over ten cities.&amp;quot;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">&amp;apos;The second came and said, &amp;quot;Master, what you left with me has multiplied five times.&amp;quot;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">&amp;apos;His master said, &amp;quot;I also grant you authority in my kingdom over five cities.&amp;quot;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">&amp;apos;Another came before the king and said, &amp;quot;Master, here is the money you entrusted to me. I hid it for safekeeping.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">You see, I live in fear of you, for everyone knows you are a strict master and impossible to please. You push us for a high return on all that you own, and you always want to gain from someone else&amp;quot;s efforts.&amp;quot;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">&amp;apos;The king said, &amp;quot;You wicked servant! I will judge you using your own words. If what you said about me is true, that I am a harsh man, pushing you for a high return and wanting gain from others&amp;quot; efforts,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">why didn&amp;quot;t you at least put my money in the bank to earn some interest on it?&amp;quot;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">&amp;apos;The king said to his other servants, &amp;quot;Take the money he has and give it to the faithful servant who multiplied my money ten times over.&amp;quot;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">&amp;apos; &amp;quot;But master,&amp;quot; the other servants objected, &amp;quot;why give it to him? He already has so much!&amp;quot;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">&amp;apos; &amp;quot;Yes,&amp;quot; replied the king. &amp;quot;But to all who have been faithful, I will give even more to them. And for the ones who have nothing, even the little they seem to have I will take from them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">Now, bring all those rebellious enemies of mine who rejected me as their king&amp;ndash;bring them here before me and execute them!&amp;quot; &amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">After saying all of this, Jesus headed straight for Jerusalem.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">When he arrived at the stables of Annia near the Mount of Olives, he sent two of his disciples ahead, saying,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">&amp;apos;When you enter the next village, you will find tethered there a donkey&amp;quot;s young colt that has never been ridden. Untie it and bring it to me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">And if anyone stops you and asks, &amp;quot;What are you doing?&amp;quot; just tell them this: &amp;quot;It is needed for the Lord.&amp;quot; &amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">The two disciples entered the village and found the colt exactly like Jesus had said.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">While they were untying it, the owners confronted them and asked, &amp;apos;What are you doing?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">The disciples replied, &amp;apos;We need this donkey for the Lord.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">As soon as he got to the bottom of the Mount of Olives, the crowd of his followers shouted with a loud outburst of ecstatic joy over all the mighty wonders of power they had witnessed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">They shouted over and over, &amp;apos;Highest praises to God for the one who comes as King in the name of the Lord! Heaven&amp;quot;s peace and glory from the highest realm now comes to us !&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">Some Jewish religious leaders who stood off from the procession said to Jesus, &amp;apos;Teacher, order your followers at once to stop saying these things!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">Jesus responded, &amp;apos;Listen to me. If my followers were silenced, the very stones would break forth with praises!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">When Jesus caught sight of the city, he burst into tears with uncontrollable weeping over Jerusalem,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">saying, &amp;apos;If only you could recognize that this day peace is within your reach! But you cannot see it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43">For the day is soon coming when your enemies will surround you, hem you in on every side, and lay siege to you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44">They will crush you to pieces, and your children too! And they will leave your city totally destroyed. Since you would not recognize God&amp;quot;s day of visitation, you will see your day of devastation!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45">Jesus entered the temple area and forcibly threw out all the merchants from their stalls.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46">He rebuked them, saying, &amp;apos;The Scriptures declare, &amp;quot;My Father&amp;quot;s house is to be filled with prayer&amp;ndash;a house of prayer, not a cave of bandits!&amp;quot; &amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="47">From then on Jesus continued teaching in the temple area, but the high priests, the experts of the law, and the prominent men of the city kept trying to find a strategy to accuse Jesus, for they wanted him dead.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="48">They could find no reason to accuse him, for he was a hero to the people and the crowds were awestruck by every word he spoke.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="20">
			<VERS vnumber="1">One day Jesus was teaching in the temple courts and sharing with the people the wonderful news of salvation. The high priest, the experts of the law, and the prominent men of the city confronted Jesus and asked him,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">&amp;apos;We want to know right now by what authority are you teaching here in the temple? And who gave you the authority to teach these things?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Jesus responded, &amp;apos;First, let me ask you a question and you tell me right now.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Did John baptize because he had a commission from heaven or merely from men?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">His interrogators pulled themselves aside to consider how to respond to Jesus. &amp;apos;What should we say? If we say that John&amp;quot;s mandate was from heaven, he will ask us, &amp;quot;Then why didn&amp;quot;t you believe him and be baptized ?&amp;quot;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">But if we say, &amp;quot;John&amp;quot;s mandate was merely from men,&amp;quot; then all the people around him will stone us, for they believe John was a prophet of God.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">So unable to devise an answer they said to Jesus, &amp;apos;We cannot tell where John&amp;quot;s authority came from.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Jesus said, &amp;apos;Then neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Jesus taught the people using this story: &amp;apos;A man once planted a vineyard, then leased it out to tenants. Then he left to go abroad and was away for a long time. &amp;apos;I ask you, what do you think the owner of the vineyard will do to his son&amp;quot;s murderers? When the people heard this story, they all agreed, &amp;apos;This should never happen!&amp;apos; They answered, &amp;apos;Why, it&amp;quot;s Caesar&amp;quot;s.&amp;apos; &amp;quot;Sit near me in the place of authority</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">At harvest time, the owner sent one of his servants to the tenants to collect the landowner&amp;quot;s share of the harvest, but the tenants sent him away, beaten and empty-handed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">So the owner dispatched another one of his servants to collect his portion, but the tenants treated him the same way. They cursed him, beat him, and sent him away empty-handed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Then the owner sent a third servant, but they brutalized him also with the same treatment.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Finally the owner of the vineyard said to his son, &amp;quot;Perhaps if I send you, my own cherished son, they will be ashamed of what they&amp;quot;ve done.&amp;quot;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">&amp;apos;But when the tenants saw the son coming, they schemed among themselves. &amp;quot;This is the heir of the vineyard! If we kill him, the inheritance will be ours.&amp;quot;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">So they threw the son off the property and killed him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">He will come back and destroy them and give his vineyard to another.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Jesus looked straight at the people and their leaders and said, &amp;apos;What do you think this verse means? &amp;quot;The worthless, rejected stone has become the cornerstone, the most important stone of all.&amp;quot;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Everyone who falls in humility upon that stone will be broken. But if that stone falls on you, it will grind you to pieces!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">When the high priests and experts of the law realized that this story was about them, they wanted to have Jesus arrested that very moment, but they were afraid of all the people.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Later, they sent spies who pretended to be honest seekers, but who wanted an opportunity to entangle Jesus by his words. Their plan was to catch him saying something against the government, so they could hand him over to the jurisdiction of the Roman authorities who would execute him for sedition .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">At the right time they asked him this question: &amp;apos;Teacher, we know that all you say is straightforward and what you teach us is right. You give us the true ways of God. You&amp;quot;re one who shows no favoritism to anyone&amp;quot;s status. So we ask you&amp;ndash;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">is it proper or not to pay taxes to a corrupt government ?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">Jesus saw right through their cunning ploy and said, &amp;apos;Why are you testing me?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">Show me one of the Roman coins. Whose head is on the coin? Whose title is stamped on it?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">Jesus said, &amp;apos;Precisely. The coin bears the image of the Emperor Caesar, and you should give back to Caesar all that belongs to him. But you bear the image of God. So give back to God all that belongs to him.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">The imposters were left speechless and amazed in the presence of all the people, unable to trap Jesus with his words.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">Some of the Sadducees (a religious group that denies there is a resurrection of the dead) came to ask Jesus this question:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">&amp;apos;Teacher, the law of Moses teaches that if a man dies before he has children, his brother should marry the widow and raise up children for his brother&amp;quot;s family line.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">Now suppose there was a family with seven brothers, and the oldest married and died without children.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">Then finally, the widow died too. So here&amp;quot;s our dilemma:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">Whose wife will the woman be when she&amp;quot;s resurrected from the dead? Which of the brothers will be her husband, since all seven were once married to her?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">Jesus replied, &amp;apos;Marriage is meant for this world only.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">Even Moses taught the resurrection of the dead when he wrote of the Lord God who was at the burning bush and said &amp;quot;I am the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.&amp;quot;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">Don&amp;quot;t you agree that God is not the God of the dead, but the God of the living? For in his eyes, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob are alive forevermore. He is the God who raises the dead.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">The experts of the law chimed in, &amp;apos;Yes, Teacher, you speak the truth beautifully.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">From then on, the religious Sadducees never dared ask Jesus a question again.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">Jesus then posed this question to the people: &amp;apos;How can the experts of the law say that Messiah is David&amp;quot;s son?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">Haven&amp;quot;t you read in the Psalms where David himself wrote: The Lord Yahweh said to my Lord,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43">until I subdue all your enemies under Your feet!&amp;quot; &amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44">Jesus explained, &amp;apos;If David calls this one &amp;quot;my Lord,&amp;quot; how can he be his son?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45">Within earshot of all the people, Jesus warned his disciples,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46">&amp;apos;Don&amp;quot;t follow the example of these pretentious experts of the law! They love to parade around in their religious garments so that people honor them wherever they go. They like to sit right up front in every meeting and push their way to the head table at every banquet.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="47">And for an offering they will pray long religious prayers at the homes of widows, cheating them out of their very livelihood. Beware of them all, because one day the Judge will strip them of honor, and judge them severely.&amp;apos;</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="21">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Jesus observed all the wealthy coming into the temple courts wanting to be noticed as they came with their offerings.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">He noticed a very poor widow who dropped two small copper coins in the offering box.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">&amp;apos;Listen to me,&amp;apos; he said. &amp;apos;This poor widow has given a larger offering than any of the wealthy.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">For the rich only gave out of their surplus, but she sacrificed out of her poverty and gave to God all that she had to live on.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Some of the disciples remarked about the beauty of the temple. They pointed out all the lovely adornments and how it was built with excellence from the gifts given to God. Jesus said, &amp;apos;Haven&amp;quot;t you observed that when the fig tree, or any tree, buds and blooms, the season is changing and summer is near?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">&amp;apos;The day of utter destruction will come to everything you admire here. It will all become a heap of rubble!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">&amp;apos;Master, tell us,&amp;apos; they asked, &amp;apos;when exactly will this happen? Can you tell us what warning sign to look for when it is about to take place?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Jesus responded, &amp;apos;Deception will run rampant and many will appear on the scene, saying I have sent them, or saying about themselves, &amp;quot;I am the Messiah!&amp;quot; These doomsday deceivers will say, &amp;quot;The end of the age is now here!&amp;quot; But listen to me. Don&amp;quot;t let any of these imposters fool you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">&amp;apos;There will also be many wars and revolutions on every side, with rumors of more wars to come. Don&amp;quot;t panic or give in to your fears, for these things are bound to happen. This is still not the end yet.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Jesus continued, &amp;apos; There will be upheavals of every kind. Nations will go to war against each other, and kingdom against kingdom.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">There will be terrible earthquakes and seismic events of epic proportion that result in famines in one place after another. There will be horrible plagues and epidemics, cataclysmic storms on the earth, and astonishing signs and cosmic disturbances in the heavens. But before all of this happens, you will be hunted down and arrested, persecuted by both civil and religious authorities, and thrown into prison.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">&amp;apos;You can expect betrayal even by your parents, your brothers, your relatives and friends&amp;ndash;and yes, some of you will die as martyrs.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">You will be hated by all because of my life in you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">But don&amp;quot;t worry. My grace will never desert you or depart from your life.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Stand firm with patient endurance and you will find your souls&amp;quot; deliverance.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">&amp;apos;When you see Jerusalem surrounded by armies, you will know for sure that its devastation is imminent.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">At that time all who are living in Judea must flee to the mountains. Those who live inside the city gates, leave and flee, and those who live outside the city must not enter it seeking refuge.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">For these will be the days of God&amp;quot;s vengeance to fulfill what has been written against Jerusalem.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">It will be extremely difficult for pregnant women and for those nursing little ones in that day, for great persecution and wrath will rise against this nation.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">Many will be cut down by the sword or scattered as prisoners to many countries. And Jerusalem shall be trampled down by nations until the days of world empires come to an end.&amp;apos;</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="37">Each day, Jesus taught in the temple and spent his nights on the Mount of Olives.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">And all the people came early to the temple courts to listen to the words he taught.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="22">
			<VERS vnumber="3">At that time Satan himself entered into Judas the locksmith, who was one of the twelve apostles.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">He secretly went to the religious hierarchy and the captains of the temple guards to discuss with them how he could betray Jesus and turn him over to their hands.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">The religious hierarchy was elated over Judas&amp;quot; treachery, and they agreed to give him a sum of money in exchange for Jesus&amp;quot; betrayal.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Judas vowed that he would find them a suitable opportunity to betray Jesus when he was away from the crowds.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">They asked him, &amp;apos;Where do we make the preparations to eat the meal?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Jesus gave them this sign: &amp;apos;When you enter the city, you will find a man carrying a jug of water. Follow him home</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">and say to the owner of the house, &amp;quot;The Teacher told us to ask you, &amp;apos;Where is the room I may use to have the Passover meal with my disciples?&amp;apos; &amp;quot;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">He will then take you to a large, fully furnished upstairs room. Make the preparations for us there.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">They went and found everything to be exactly like Jesus had prophesied, and they prepared the Passover meal.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">When Jesus arrived at the upper room, he took his place at the table along with all the apostles.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Then he told them, &amp;apos;I have longed with passion and desire to eat this Passover lamb with you before I endure my sufferings.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">I promise you that the next time we eat this, we will be together in the feast of God&amp;quot;s kingdom.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Then he raised a cup and gave thanks to God and said to them, &amp;apos;Take this and pass it on to one another and drink.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">I promise you that the next time we drink this wine, we will be together in the feast of God&amp;quot;s kingdom.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Then he lifted up a loaf, and after praying a prayer of thanksgiving to God, he gave each of his apostles a piece of bread, saying, &amp;apos;This loaf is my body, which is now being offered to you. Always eat it to remember me.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">After supper was over, he lifted the cup again and said, &amp;apos;This cup is my blood of the new covenant I make with you, and it will be poured out soon for all of you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">But I want you to know that the hands of the one who delivers me to be the sacrifice are with mine on the table this very moment.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">The Son of Man must now go where he will be sacrificed. But there will be great and unending doom for the man who betrays me.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">The apostles questioned among themselves which one of them was about to do this.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">The disciples bickered over which one of them would be considered the greatest in the kingdom.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">Jesus interrupted their argument, saying, &amp;apos;The kings and men of authority in this world rule oppressively over their subjects, claiming that they do it for the good of the people. They are obsessed with how others see them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">But this is not your calling. You will lead by a different model. The greatest one among you will live as one called to serve others without honor. The greatest honor and authority is reserved for the one who has a servant heart.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">The leaders who are served are the most important in your eyes, but in the kingdom, it is the servants who lead. Am I not here with you as one who serves?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">&amp;apos;Because you have stood with me through all my trials and ordeals,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">I am promising you the kingdom that the Father has promised me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">We will celebrate in this kingdom and you will feast with me at my table. And each of you will be given a throne, twelve thrones in all, and you will be made rulers on thrones to judge the tribes of Israel.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">&amp;apos;Peter, my dear friend, listen to what I&amp;quot;m about to tell you. Satan has obtained permission to come and sift you all like wheat and test your faith.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">But I have prayed for you, Peter, that you would stay faithful to me no matter what comes. Remember this: after you have turned back to me and have been restored, make it your life mission to strengthen the faith of your brothers.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">&amp;apos;But Lord,&amp;apos; Peter replied, &amp;apos;I am ready to stand with you to the very end, even if it means prison or death!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">Jesus looked at him and prophesied, &amp;apos;Before the rooster crows in the morning, you will deny three times that you even know me.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">Then he said to all of them, &amp;apos;When I sent you out empty-handed, did you lack anything?&amp;apos; &amp;apos;Not a thing,&amp;apos; they answered. &amp;apos;God provided all we needed.&amp;apos; Jesus said, &amp;apos;But now I say to you: Take what you need. Peter again said, &amp;apos;I&amp;quot;m not one of his disciples.&amp;apos; Jesus responded, &amp;apos;If I tell you the truth, you won&amp;quot;t believe me. He said to them, &amp;apos;You are the ones who say I am.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">If you have money, take it &amp;ndash;and a knapsack and a sword. Danger is imminent.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">For the prophetic Scripture about me &amp;quot;He will be accused of being a criminal&amp;quot; will now come to pass. All that was prophesied of me will be fulfilled.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">The disciples told him, &amp;apos;Lord, we already have two swords!&amp;apos; &amp;apos;You still don&amp;quot;t understand,&amp;apos; Jesus responded.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">Jesus left the upper room with his disciples and, as was his habit, went to the Mount of Olives, his place of secret prayer .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">There he told the apostles, &amp;apos;Keep praying for strength to be spared from the severe test of your faith that is about to come.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">Then he withdrew from them a short distance to be alone. Kneeling down, he prayed,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">&amp;apos;Father, if you are willing, take this cup of agony away from me. But no matter what, your will must be mine.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43">Jesus called for an angel of glory to strengthen him, and the angel appeared.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44">He prayed even more passionately, like one being sacrificed, until he was in such intense agony of spirit that his sweat became drops of blood, dripping onto the ground.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45">When Jesus finished praying, he got up and went to his disciples and found them all asleep, for they were exhausted and overwhelmed with sorrow.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46">&amp;apos;Why are you sleeping?&amp;apos; he asked them. &amp;apos;You need to be alert and pray for the strength to endure the great temptation.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="47">No sooner had he finished speaking when suddenly a mob approached, and in front of the mob was his disciple Judas. He walked up close to Jesus and greeted him with a kiss. For he had agreed to give the religious leaders a sign, saying, &amp;apos;The one I kiss is the one to seize.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="48">Jesus looked at him with sorrow and said, &amp;apos;A kiss, Judas? Are you really going to betray the Son of Man with a kiss?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="49">When the other disciples understood what was happening, they asked, &amp;apos;Lord, shall we fight them with our swords?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="50">Just then, one of the disciples swung his sword at the high priest&amp;quot;s servant and slashed off his right ear.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="51">Jesus stopped the incident from escalating any further by saying, &amp;apos;Enough of this!&amp;apos; Then he touched the right side of the injured man&amp;quot;s head and the ear grew back &amp;ndash;he was healed!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="52">Jesus turned to those who had come to seize him&amp;ndash;the ruling priests, the officers of the temple police, and the religious leaders&amp;ndash;and said, &amp;apos;Am I a criminal that you come to capture me with clubs and swords? Wasn&amp;quot;t I with you day after day, teaching in the temple courts?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="53">You could have seized me at any time. But in the darkness of night you have now found your time, for it belongs to you and to the prince of darkness.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="54">The religious leaders seized Jesus and led him away, but Peter followed from a safe distance. They brought him to the home of the high priest, where people were already gathered out in the courtyard.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="55">Someone had built a fire, so Peter inched closer and sat down among them to stay warm.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="56">A girl noticed Peter sitting in the firelight. Staring at him, she pointed him out and said, &amp;apos;This man is one of Jesus&amp;quot; disciples!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="57">Peter flatly denied it, saying, &amp;apos;What are you talking about, girl? I don&amp;quot;t know him!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="58">A little while later, someone else spotted Peter and said, &amp;apos;I recognize you. You&amp;quot;re one of his, I know it!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="59">About an hour later, someone else identified Peter and insisted he was a disciple of Jesus, saying, &amp;apos;Look at him! He&amp;quot;s from Galilee, just like Jesus. I know he&amp;quot;s one of them.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="60">But Peter was adamant. &amp;apos;Listen, I don&amp;quot;t know what you&amp;quot;re talking about. Don&amp;quot;t you understand? I don&amp;quot;t even know him.&amp;apos; While the words were still in his mouth, the rooster crowed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="61">At that moment, the Lord, who was being led through the courtyard by his captors, turned around and gazed at Peter. All at once Peter remembered the words Jesus had prophesied over him, &amp;apos;Before the rooster crows in the morning, you will deny three times that you even know me.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="62">Peter burst into tears, ran off from the crowd, and wept bitterly.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="63">Those who were guarding Jesus mocked and beat him severely.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="64">They also made fun of him, blindfolding him and slapping his face and saying, &amp;apos;Prove that you are a prophet and tell us which one of us hit you!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="65">They blasphemed and heaped insult after insult upon him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="66">At daybreak the high priests, the experts of the law, and the top religious leaders convened and had Jesus brought before their council.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="67">They asked him point blank, &amp;apos;Tell us, are you the Christ, the Messiah, or not?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="68">And if I question you, you will not answer me or release me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="69">But from today on, the Son of Man will be enthroned in the place of honor, power, and authority with Almighty God.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="70">They all shouted, &amp;apos;Then you do claim to be the Son of God?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="71">They all shouted, &amp;apos;We&amp;quot;ve heard it from his very lips! What further proof do we need?&amp;apos;</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="23">
			<VERS vnumber="1">The entire council stood at once and took Jesus to Pilate, the Roman governor.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">They accused him of false testimony, saying, &amp;apos;This man tells us not to pay our taxes to Caesar. And he proclaims himself to be Christ the King and Messiah. He&amp;quot;s a deceiver of our nation.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Pilate asked Jesus, &amp;apos;Is this true? Are you their king and Messiah?&amp;apos; Jesus answered, &amp;apos;It is true.&amp;apos; Finally their shouts and screams succeeded. The soldiers, after they crucified him, gambled over his clothing.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Pilate turned to the high priests and to the gathered crowd and said, &amp;apos;This man has committed no crime. I find nothing wrong with him.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">But they yelled and demanded that Pilate do something, saying, &amp;apos;He has stirred up our nation, misleading people from the moment he began teaching in Galilee until he has come here to Jerusalem!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">When he saw Jesus, he was elated, for he had heard a great deal about his ministry and wanted Jesus to perform a miracle in front of him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Antipas questioned him at length, but Jesus wouldn&amp;quot;t even answer him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">That day, Antipas and Pilate healed their long-standing feud and they became good friends.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">For it was Pilate&amp;quot;s custom to honor the Jewish holiday by releasing a prisoner.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">When the crowd heard this, they went wild. Erupting with anger, they cried out, &amp;apos;No! Take this one away and release Barabbas!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">For Barabbas had been thrown in prison for robbery and murder.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Pilate, wanting to release Jesus, tried to convince them it was best to let Jesus go,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">but they screamed out over and over, &amp;apos;Crucify him! Crucify him!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">A third time, Pilate asked the crowd, &amp;apos;What evil crime has this man committed that I should have him crucified? I haven&amp;quot;t found one thing that warrants a death sentence! I will have him flogged severely and then release him.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">But the people and the high priests, shouting like a mob, screamed out at the top of their lungs, &amp;apos;No! Crucify him! Crucify him!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">Pilate caved in to the crowd and ordered that the will of the people be done.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">Then he released the guilty murderer Barabbas, as they had insisted, and handed Jesus over to be crucified.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">As the guards led Jesus to be crucified, there was an African man in the crowd named Simon, from Libya. He had just arrived from a rural village to keep the Feast of the Passover . The guards laid Jesus&amp;quot; cross on Simon&amp;quot;s shoulders and forced him to walk behind Jesus, carrying his cross.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">Massive crowds gathered to follow Jesus, including a number of women, who were wailing with sorrow over him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">Jesus turned to them and said, &amp;apos;Daughters of Jerusalem, do not weep for me. You should be weeping for yourselves and your children.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">The day is coming when it will not be the women with children who are blessed but those who are childless. Then you will say, &amp;quot;The barren women are the most fortunate! Those who have never given birth and never nursed a child&amp;ndash; they are more fortunate than we, for they will never see their children put to death !&amp;quot;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">And the people will cry out for the mountains and hills to fall on top of them to hide them from all that is to come.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">For if this is what they do to the living Branch, what will they do with the dead ones?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">The guards led away two criminals with Jesus, to execute all three at the same time.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">When they came to the place that is known as The Skull, the guards crucified Jesus, nailing him on the center cross between the two criminals.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">While they were nailing Jesus to the cross, he prayed over and over, &amp;apos;Father, forgive them, for they don&amp;quot;t know what they&amp;quot;re doing.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">A great crowd gathered to watch what was happening. The religious leaders sneered at Jesus and mocked him, saying, &amp;apos;Look at this man! What kind of &amp;quot;chosen Messiah&amp;quot; is this? He pretended to save others, but he can&amp;quot;t even save himself!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">The soldiers joined in the mockery, offering Jesus a drink of vinegar.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">One of the criminals hanging on the cross next to Jesus kept ridiculing him, saying, &amp;apos;What kind of Messiah are you? Save yourself and save us from this death!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">The criminal hanging on the other cross rebuked the man, saying, &amp;apos;Don&amp;quot;t you fear God? You&amp;quot;re about to die!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">We deserve to be condemned. We&amp;quot;re just being repaid for what we&amp;quot;ve done. But this man&amp;ndash;he&amp;quot;s done nothing wrong!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">Then he said, &amp;apos;I beg of you, Jesus, show me grace and take me with you into your everlasting kingdom!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43">Jesus responded, &amp;apos;I promise you&amp;ndash;this very day you will enter paradise with me.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44">It was now only midday, yet the whole world became dark for three hours as the light of the sun faded away.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45">And suddenly in the temple the thick veil hanging in the Holy Place was ripped in two!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46">Then Jesus cried out with a loud voice, &amp;apos;Father, I surrender my Spirit into your hands.&amp;apos; And he took his last breath and died.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="47">When the Roman captain overseeing the crucifixion witnessed all that took place, he was awestruck and glorified God. Acknowledging what they had done, he said, &amp;apos;I have no doubt; we just killed the righteous one.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="48">The crowds that had gathered to observe this spectacle went back to their homes, overcome with deep sorrow and devastated by what they had witnessed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="49">But standing off at a distance were some who truly knew Jesus, and the women who had followed him all the way from Galilee were keeping vigil.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="52">He came before Pilate and asked permission to take the body of Jesus for a proper burial, and Pilate granted his request .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="53">So he took the body from the cross, wrapped it in a winding sheet of linen, and placed it in a new, unused tomb chiseled out of solid rock.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="54">It was Preparation Day, and the Sabbath was fast approaching.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="55">The women who had been companions of Jesus from the beginning saw all this take place and carefully contemplated how the body was laid in the tomb.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="56">Afterward they returned home and prepared fragrant spices and ointments and were planning to anoint his body after the Sabbath was completed, according to the commandments of the law.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="24">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Very early that Sunday morning, the women made their way to the tomb, carrying the spices they had prepared.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Among them were Mary Magdalene, Joanna, and Jesus&amp;quot; mother Mary.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Arriving at the tomb they discovered that the huge stone covering the entrance had been rolled aside,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">so they went in to look. But the tomb was empty. The body of Jesus was gone!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">They stood there, stunned and perplexed. Suddenly, two men appeared above them in dazzling white robes shining like lightning.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Terrified, the women fell to the ground on their faces. The men in white said to them, &amp;apos;Why would you look for the Living One in a tomb? He is not here, for he has risen! They stopped, and the one named Cleopas answered, &amp;apos;Haven&amp;quot;t you heard? Are you the only one in Jerusalem unaware of the things that have happened over the last few days?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Have you forgotten what he said to you while he was still in Galilee:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">&amp;quot;The destiny of the Son of Man is to be handed over to sinful men, to be nailed to a cross, and on the third day to rise again&amp;quot;?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">All at once they remembered his words.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Leaving the tomb, they went to break the news to the Eleven and to all the others of what they had seen and heard.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">When the disciples heard the testimony of the women, it made no sense, and they were unable to believe what they heard.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">But Peter jumped up and ran the entire distance to the tomb to see for himself. Stooping down, he looked inside and discovered it was empty! There was only the linen sheet lying there. Staggered by this, he walked away, wondering what it meant.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Later that same day, two of Jesus&amp;quot; disciples were walking from Jerusalem to Emmaus, a journey of about seventeen miles.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">They were unaware that it was actually Jesus walking alongside them, for God prevented them from recognizing him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Jesus asked, &amp;apos;What things?&amp;apos; &amp;apos;The things about Jesus, the man from Nazareth,&amp;apos; they replied. &amp;apos;He was a mighty prophet of God who performed miracles and wonders. His words were powerful and he had great favor with God and the people. Knowing that they were still wondering if he was real, Jesus said, &amp;apos;Here, let me show you. Give me something to eat.&amp;apos; Overwhelmed and ecstatic with joy, they made their way back to Jerusalem.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Early this morning, some of the women informed us of something amazing.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">They said they went to the tomb and found it empty. They claimed two angels appeared and told them that Jesus is now alive.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">Some of us went to see for ourselves and found the tomb exactly as the women had said. But no one has seen him.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">Jesus said to them, &amp;apos;Why are you so thick-headed? Why do you find it so hard to believe every word the prophets have spoken?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">Wasn&amp;quot;t it necessary for the Messiah to experience all these sufferings and afterward to enter into his glory?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">And beginning with Moses and all the prophets he carefully unveiled to them the revelation of himself throughout the Scriptures.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">As they approached the village, Jesus walked on ahead, telling them he was going on to a distant place.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">They urged him to remain there with them and pleaded, &amp;apos;Stay with us. It will be dark soon.&amp;apos; So Jesus went with them into the village.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">Joining them at the table for supper, he took bread and blessed it and broke it, then gave it to them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">All at once their eyes were opened and they realized he was Jesus! Then suddenly, in a flash, Jesus vanished from before their eyes!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">Stunned, they looked at each other and said, &amp;apos;Why didn&amp;quot;t we recognize him? Didn&amp;quot;t our hearts burn with the flames of holy passion while we walked beside him? He unveiled for us such profound revelation from the Scriptures!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">They left at once and hurried back to Jerusalem to tell the other disciples. When they found the Eleven and the other disciples all together,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">they overheard them saying, &amp;apos;It&amp;quot;s really true! The Lord has risen from the dead. He even appeared to Peter!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">Then the two disciples told the others what had happened to them on the road to Emmaus and how Jesus had unveiled himself in the breaking of bread.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">Why are you so frightened? Don&amp;quot;t let doubt enter your hearts.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">See my pierced hands and feet. See for yourselves, it is I, standing here alive. Touch me and know that my wounds are real. A spirit does not have a body of flesh and bone as you see that I have.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">Then he showed them his pierced hands and feet and let them touch his wounds.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">The disciples were ecstatic, yet dumbfounded, unable to fully comprehend it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44">Then he said to them, &amp;apos;Don&amp;quot;t you remember the words that I spoke to you when I was still with you? I told you that I would fulfill everything written about me, including all the prophecies from the law of Moses through the Psalms and the writings of the prophets.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45">He supernaturally unlocked their understanding to receive the revelation of the Scriptures,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46">and said to them, &amp;apos;Everything that has happened fulfills what the Scriptures prophesied of me. The Messiah was destined to suffer and rise from the dead on the third day.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="47">Now you must go into all the nations and preach repentance and forgiveness of sins so that they will turn to me. Start right here in Jerusalem,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="48">for you are my witnesses and have seen for yourselves all that has transpired.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="49">I will send the fulfillment of the Father&amp;quot;s promise to you, so stay here in the city until you are clothed with the mighty power of heaven.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="50">Jesus led his disciples out to Bethany. He lifted his hands over them and blessed them in his love.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="51">While he was still speaking words of love and blessing, he floated off the ground into the sky , ascending into heaven before their very eyes!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="52">And all they could do was worship him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="53">Every day they went to the temple, to praise and worship God.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1">In the beginning the Living Expression was already there. And the Living Expression was with God, yet fully God. this Living Expression made all things, for his life is light for all humanity. Light that darkness could not overcome! a messenger named John. and shine upon everyone. yet the world was unaware. or from natural means, or by a man&amp;quot;s desire, but he was born of God. became a man and lived among us! We gazed upon his glory, the glory of the One and Only with tender mercy and truth! because he existed before I was even born.&amp;apos; we received grace heaped upon more grace! unveils truth wrapped in tender mercy. who is cherished by the Father Now that he has come to us, he has unfolded So they pressed him further, &amp;apos;Are you the prophet Moses said was coming, the one we&amp;quot;re expecting?&amp;apos; Jesus answered, &amp;apos;Nathanael, right before Philip came to you, I saw you sitting under the shade of a fig tree.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">They were together&amp;ndash; face-to-face , in the very beginning.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">And through his creative inspiration for nothing has existence apart from him! and to help everyone believe. For he was merely a messenger to speak the truth about the Light. to those who should have received him, but they did not recognize him. he gave authority to become the children of God! who came from the Father overflowing when he taught the people, &amp;apos;He&amp;quot;s the One! He&amp;quot;s the One I&amp;quot;ve been telling you would come after me, even though he ranks far above me, except his uniquely beloved Son, and held close to his heart. the full explanation of who God truly is! &amp;apos;No,&amp;apos; John replied. &amp;apos;No,&amp;apos; he replied.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">A fountain of life was in him,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">And this Light never fails to shine through darkness&amp;ndash;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Suddenly a man appeared who was sent from God,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">For he came as a witness, to point the way to the Light of Life ,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">John was not that Light but he came to show who is.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">For the perfect Light of Truth was coming into the world</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">He entered into the world he created,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">He came to the people he created &amp;ndash;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">But those who embraced him and took hold of his name</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">He was not born by the joining of human parents</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">And so the Living Expression</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">John announced the truth about him</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">And from the overflow of his fullness</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Moses gave us the Law, but Jesus, the Anointed One,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">No one ever before gazed upon the full splendor of God</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Now this was John&amp;quot;s testimony when some of the Jewish leaders sent an entourage of priests and temple servants from Jerusalem to interrogate him. &amp;apos;Who are you?&amp;apos; they asked him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">John answered them directly, saying, &amp;apos;I am not the Messiah!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">&amp;apos;Then who are you?&amp;apos; they asked. &amp;apos;Are you Elijah?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">&amp;apos;Then who are you?&amp;apos; they demanded. &amp;apos;We need an answer for those who sent us. Tell us something about yourself&amp;ndash;anything!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">John answered them, &amp;apos;I am an urgent, thunderous voice crying out in the desert&amp;ndash;clear the way and prepare your hearts for the coming of the Lord Yahweh !&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">Then some members of the religious sect known as the Pharisees questioned John,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">&amp;apos;Why do you baptize the people if you are neither the Messiah, Elijah, nor the Prophet?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">All these events took place at Bethany, where John was baptizing at the place of the crossing of the Jordan River.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">The very next day, John saw Jesus coming to him to be baptized, and John cried out, &amp;apos;Look! There he is&amp;ndash;God&amp;quot;s Lamb! He takes away the sin of the entire world!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">I told you that a Mighty One would come who is far greater than I am, because he existed long before I was born!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">My baptism was for the preparation of his appearing to Israel, even though I didn&amp;quot;t recognize him.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">Then, as he baptized Jesus, he proclaimed these words: &amp;apos;I see the Spirit of God appear like a dove descending from the heavenly realm and landing upon him&amp;ndash;and it remained on him!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">Before this I didn&amp;quot;t know who he was. But the one who sent me to baptize with water had told me, &amp;quot;You will see the Spirit come down and stay on someone. He will be the One I have sent to baptize with the Holy Spirit.&amp;quot;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">Now I have seen this happen and I can tell you for sure that this man is the Son of God.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">And as soon as John&amp;quot;s two disciples heard this, they immediately left John and began to follow a short distance behind Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">Jesus turned around and saw they were following him and asked, &amp;apos;What do you want?&amp;apos; They responded, &amp;apos;Rabbi (which means, Master Teacher ), where are you staying?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">Jesus answered, &amp;apos;Come and discover for yourselves.&amp;apos; So they went with him and saw where he was staying, and since it was late in the afternoon, they spent the rest of the day with Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">Then Andrew brought Simon to meet Jesus. When he gazed upon Andrew&amp;quot;s brother, he prophesied to him, &amp;apos;You are Simon and your father&amp;quot;s name is John. But from now on, everyone will call you Cephas&amp;apos; (which means, Peter the Rock).</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43">The next day, Jesus decided to go to Galilee, where he found Philip. Jesus said to him, &amp;apos;Come and follow me.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44">(Now Philip, Andrew, and Peter had all grown up together in the village of Bethsaida.)</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45">Philip went to look for his friend , Nathanael, and told him, &amp;apos;We&amp;quot;ve found him! We&amp;quot;ve found the One we&amp;quot;ve been waiting for! It&amp;quot;s Jesus, son of Joseph from Nazareth! He&amp;quot;s the One whom Moses and the prophets prophesied would come!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46">Nathanael sneered , &amp;apos;Nazareth! What good thing could ever come from Nazareth?&amp;apos; Philip answered, &amp;apos;Come and let&amp;quot;s find out!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="47">When Jesus saw Nathanael approaching, he said, &amp;apos;Here comes a true son of Israel&amp;ndash;an honest man with no hidden motive!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="48">Nathanael was stunned and said, &amp;apos;But you&amp;quot;ve never met me&amp;ndash;how do you know anything about me?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="49">Nathanael blurted out, &amp;apos;Teacher, you are truly the Son of God and the King of Israel!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="50">Jesus answered, &amp;apos;Do you believe simply because I told you I saw you sitting under a fig tree? You will experience even more impressive things than that!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="51">I prophesy to you eternal truth: From now on, you all will see an open heaven and gaze upon the Son of Man like a stairway reaching into the sky with the messengers of God climbing up and down upon him!&amp;apos;</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="2">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Now on the third day, Jesus&amp;quot; mother went to a wedding feast in the Galilean village of Cana.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Jesus replied, &amp;apos;My dear one, don&amp;quot;t you understand that if I do this, it will change nothing for you, but it will change everything for me! My hour of unveiling my power has not yet come.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Mary then went to the servers and told them, &amp;apos;Whatever Jesus tells you, do it!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Nearby stood six stone water pots meant to be used for the Jewish washing rituals. Each one could hold about twenty gallons or more.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Jesus came to the servers and instructed them, &amp;apos;Fill the pots with water, right up to the very brim. &amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Then he said, &amp;apos;Now fill your pitchers and take them to the master of ceremonies.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">And when they poured out their pitchers for the master of ceremonies to sample, the water had become wine! When he tasted the water that had become wine, the master of ceremonies was impressed with its quality. (Although he didn&amp;quot;t know where the wine had come from, only the servers knew.) He called the bridegroom over</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">and said to him, &amp;apos;Every host serves his best wine first, until everyone has had a cup or two, then he serves the cheaper wine. But you, my friend, you&amp;quot;ve reserved the most exquisite wine until now!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">This miracle in Cana was the first of the many extraordinary miracles Jesus performed in Galilee that revealed his glory, and his disciples believed in him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">After the wedding, Jesus, his mother and brothers, and his disciples traveled to Capernaum and stayed there for a few days.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">When the time was close for the Jewish Passover to begin, Jesus walked to Jerusalem.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">As he went into the temple courtyard, he noticed it was filled with merchants selling oxen, lambs, and doves for exorbitant prices , while others were overcharging as they exchanged currency behind their counters.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">So Jesus found some cords and made them into a whip. Then he drove out every one of them and their animals from the courtyard of the temple, and he kicked over their tables filled with money, scattering it everywhere!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">And he told the merchants, &amp;apos;Get these things out of here! Don&amp;quot;t you dare commercialize my Father&amp;quot;s house!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">That&amp;quot;s when his disciples remembered the Scripture: &amp;apos;I am consumed with a fiery passion to keep your house pure!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Then the Jewish religious leaders challenged Jesus, &amp;apos;What authority do you have to do this sort of thing and what supernatural sign will you show us to prove it?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Jesus answered, &amp;apos;Destroy this temple, and I will raise it up again in three days.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Then the Jewish leaders sneered at Jesus&amp;quot; answer, &amp;apos;This temple took forty-six years to build, and you mean to tell us that you will raise it up in three days?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">But they failed to understand that Jesus was speaking of the &amp;apos;temple&amp;apos; of his body.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">The disciples remembered his prophecy after Jesus rose from the dead, and believed both the Scripture and what Jesus had said.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">While Jesus was at the Passover Feast, the number of his followers began to grow , and many gave their allegiance to him because of all the miraculous signs they had seen him doing!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">But Jesus did not yet entrust himself to them, because he knew how fickle human hearts can be.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">He needed no one to tell him about human nature, for he fully understood what man was capable of doing.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="3">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Now there was a prominent religious leader among the Jews named Nicodemus, who was part of the sect called the Pharisees.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">One night he discreetly came to Jesus and said, &amp;apos;Rabbi, we know that you are a teacher come from God, for no one performs the miracle signs that you do, unless God&amp;quot;s power is with him.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Jesus answered, &amp;apos;Nicodemus, listen to this eternal truth: Before a person can even perceive God&amp;quot;s kingdom, they must first experience a rebirth.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Nicodemus said, &amp;apos;Rebirth? How can a gray-headed man be reborn? It&amp;quot;s impossible for anyone to go back into the womb a second time and be reborn!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Jesus answered, &amp;apos;I speak an eternal truth: Unless you are born of water and the Spirit, you will never enter God&amp;quot;s kingdom.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">For the natural realm only gives birth to things that are natural, but the spiritual realm gives birth to supernatural life!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">&amp;apos;You shouldn&amp;quot;t be amazed by my statement, &amp;quot;You all must be born from above!&amp;quot;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">For the Spirit-Wind blows as it chooses. You can hear its sound, but you don&amp;quot;t know where it came from or where it&amp;quot;s going. So it is the same with those who are Spirit-born!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Nicodemus replied, &amp;apos;I don&amp;quot;t understand; what do you mean? How does this happen?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Jesus answered, &amp;apos;Nicodemus, aren&amp;quot;t you the respected teacher in Israel, and yet you don&amp;quot;t understand this revelation?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">I speak eternal truths about things I know, things I&amp;quot;ve seen and experienced&amp;ndash;and still you don&amp;quot;t accept what I reveal.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">If you&amp;quot;re unable to believe what I&amp;quot;ve told you about the natural realm, what will you do when I begin to unveil the heavenly realm?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">No one has risen into the heavenly realm except the Son of Man who also exists in heaven.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">&amp;apos;And just as Moses in the desert lifted up the brass replica of a venomous snake on a pole for all the people to see and be healed, so the Son of Man is ready to be lifted up,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">so that those who truly believe in him will not perish but be given eternal life.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">For here is the way God loved the world&amp;ndash;he gave his only, unique Son as a gift. So now everyone who believes in him will never perish but experience everlasting life.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">&amp;apos;God did not send his Son into the world to judge and condemn the world, but to be its Savior and rescue it!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">So now there is no longer any condemnation for those who believe in him, but the unbeliever already lives under condemnation because they do not believe in the name of the only Son of God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">And here is the basis for their judgment: The Light of God has now come into the world, but the people loved darkness more than the Light, because they want the darkness to conceal their evil.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">So the wicked hate the Light and try to hide from it, for the Light fully exposes their lives.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">But those who love the truth will come into the Light, for the Light will reveal that it was God who produced their fruitful works.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Then Jesus and his disciples left for a length of time into the Judean countryside where they baptized the people.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">At this time John was still baptizing people at Aenon, near Salim, where there was plenty of water, and the people kept coming for John to baptize them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">(This was before John was thrown into prison.)</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">An argument started between John&amp;quot;s disciples and a particular Jewish man about baptism.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">So they went to John and asked him, &amp;apos;Teacher, are you aware that the One you told us about at the crossing place&amp;ndash;he&amp;quot;s now baptizing crowds larger than yours. People are flocking to him!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">John answered them, &amp;apos;A person cannot receive even one thing unless God bestows it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">You&amp;quot;ve heard me tell you that I am not the Messiah, but certainly I am the messenger sent ahead of him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">He is the Bridegroom, and the bride belongs to him. I am the friend of the Bridegroom who stands nearby and listens with great joy to the Bridegroom&amp;quot;s voice. Because of his words, my joy is complete and overflows!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">It is necessary for him to increase and for me to decrease.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">&amp;apos;For the one who is from the earth belongs to the earth and speaks from the natural realm. But the One who comes from above is above everything and speaks of the highest realm of all !</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">His message is about what he has seen and experienced, even though people don&amp;quot;t accept it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">Yet those who embrace his message know in their hearts that it&amp;quot;s the truth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">&amp;apos;The One whom God has sent to represent him will speak the words of God, because God has poured out upon him the fullness of the Holy Spirit without limitation.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">The Father loves his Son so much that he has given all things into his hands.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">Those who trust in the Son possess eternal life; those who don&amp;quot;t obey the Son will not see life, and God&amp;quot;s anger will rise up against them.&amp;apos;</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="4">
			<VERS vnumber="1">The news quickly reached the Jewish religious leaders known as the Pharisees that Jesus was drawing greater crowds of followers coming to be baptized than John.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">(Although Jesus himself didn&amp;quot;t baptize, but only his disciples.)</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Jesus heard what was being said and abruptly left Judea and returned to the province of Galilee,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">and he had to pass through Samaria.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Jesus arrived at the Samaritan village of Sychar, near the field that Jacob had given to his son Joseph.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">She replied, &amp;apos;Why would a Jewish man ask a Samaritan woman for a drink of water?&amp;apos; (For Jews have no dealings with Samaritans.)</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Jesus replied, &amp;apos;If you only knew who I am and the gift that God wants to give you, you&amp;quot;d ask me for a drink, and I would give you living water.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">The woman replied, &amp;apos;But sir, you don&amp;quot;t even have a bucket, and the well is very deep. So where do you find this &amp;quot;living water&amp;quot;?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Do you really think that you are greater than our ancestor Jacob who dug this well and drank from it himself, along with his children and livestock?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Jesus answered, &amp;apos;If you drink from Jacob&amp;quot;s well, you&amp;quot;ll be thirsty again,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">but if anyone drinks the living water I give them, they will never be thirsty again. For when you drink the water I give you, it becomes a gushing fountain of the Holy Spirit , flooding you with endless life!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">The woman replied, &amp;apos;Let me drink that water so I&amp;quot;ll never be thirsty again and won&amp;quot;t have to come back here to draw water.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Jesus said, &amp;apos;Go get your husband and bring him back here.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">&amp;apos;But I&amp;quot;m not married,&amp;apos; the woman answered. &amp;apos;That&amp;quot;s true,&amp;apos; Jesus said, Jesus responded, The man believed in his heart the words of Jesus and set off for home. &amp;apos;Yesterday,&amp;apos; they said, &amp;apos;at one in the afternoon. All at once his fever broke&amp;ndash; and now he&amp;quot;s well !&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">&amp;apos;for you&amp;quot;ve been married five times, and now you&amp;quot;re living with a man who is not your husband. You have told the truth.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">The woman changed the subject. &amp;apos;You must be a prophet!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">So tell me this: Why do our fathers worship God on this nearby mountain, but your people teach that Jerusalem is the place where we must worship. Who is right?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">&amp;apos;Believe me, dear woman, the time has come when you will worship the Father neither on a mountain nor in Jerusalem, but in your heart.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Your people don&amp;quot;t really know the One they worship, but we Jews worship out of our experience, for it&amp;quot;s from the Jews that salvation is available.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">The woman said, &amp;apos; This is all so confusing , but I do know that the Anointed One is coming&amp;ndash;the true Messiah. And when he comes, he will tell us everything we need to know.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">Jesus said to her, &amp;apos;You don&amp;quot;t have to wait any longer, the Anointed One is here speaking with you&amp;ndash;I am the One you&amp;quot;re looking for.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">At that moment, his disciples returned and were stunned to see Jesus speaking with a Samaritan woman, yet none of them dared ask him why or what they were discussing.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">All at once, the woman left her water jar and ran off to her village and told everyone,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">&amp;apos;Come and meet a man at the well who told me everything I&amp;quot;ve ever done! He could be the One we&amp;quot;ve been waiting for.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">Hearing this, the people came streaming out of the village to go see Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">Then the disciples began to insist that Jesus eat some of the food they brought back with them, saying, &amp;apos;Teacher, you must eat something.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">But Jesus told them, &amp;apos;I have eaten a meal you don&amp;quot;t know about.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">Puzzled by this, the disciples began to discuss it among themselves, &amp;apos;Did someone already bring him food?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">To clarify, Jesus spoke up and said, &amp;apos;My food is to do the will of him who sent me and bring it to completion.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">As the crowds emerged from the village, Jesus said to his disciples , &amp;apos;Why would you say, &amp;quot;The harvest is another four months away&amp;quot;? Look at all the people coming&amp;ndash;now is harvest time! Their hearts are like vast fields of ripened grain&amp;ndash;ready for a harvest.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">Everyone who reaps these souls for eternal life will receive a reward. Both those who plant spiritual seeds and those who reap the spiritual harvest will celebrate together with great joy!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">And this confirms the saying, &amp;quot;One sows the seed and another reaps the harvest.&amp;quot;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">I have sent you out to harvest a field that you haven&amp;quot;t planted, where many others have labored long and hard before you. And now you are privileged to profit from their labors and reap the harvest.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">Many from the Samaritan village became believers in Jesus because of the woman&amp;quot;s testimony: &amp;apos;He told me everything I ever did!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">Then they begged Jesus to stay with them, so he stayed there for two days,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">resulting in many more coming to faith in him because of his message.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">The Samaritans said to the woman, &amp;apos;Now we&amp;quot;ve heard him ourselves. We no longer believe just because of what you told us, but we&amp;quot;re convinced that he really is the true Savior of the world!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43">On the third day Jesus left there and continued his journey to Galilee, where he had been raised .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44">Now Jesus knew that prophets are honored everywhere except in their own hometown.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45">Even so, as Jesus arrived in the province of Galilee, the people welcomed him with open arms. Many of them had been in Jerusalem during the Passover Festival and had witnessed firsthand the miracles he had performed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="48">So Jesus said to him, &amp;apos;You never believe unless you see signs and wonders.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="49">But the man continued to plead, &amp;apos;Come with me to Capernaum before my little boy dies!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="50">Jesus looked him in the eyes and said, &amp;apos;Go back home now. I promise you, your son will live.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="51">When he was still a distance from Capernaum, his servants met him on the road and told him the good news, &amp;apos;Your son is healed! He&amp;quot;s alive!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="52">Overjoyed, the father asked his servants, &amp;apos;When did my son begin to recover?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="53">Then the father immediately realized that it was at that very same hour that Jesus spoke the words to him, &amp;apos;Your son will live.&amp;apos; From that day forward, the man, his servants, and all his family believed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="54">Healing the official&amp;quot;s son was Jesus&amp;quot; second extraordinary miracle in Galilee after returning from Judea.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="5">
			<VERS vnumber="1">From Galilee, Jesus returned to Jerusalem to observe one of the Jewish feasts.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Inside the city, near the Sheep Gate, there is a pool called in Aramaic, The House of Loving Kindness, surrounded by five covered porches.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Hundreds of sick people were lying under the covered porches&amp;ndash;the paralyzed, the blind, and the crippled&amp;ndash;all of them waiting for their healing.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">For an angel of God periodically descended into the pool to stir the waters, and the first one who stepped into the pool after the waters swirled would instantly be healed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Among the many sick people lying there was a man who had been disabled for thirty-eight years.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">When Jesus saw him lying there, he knew that the man had been crippled for a long time. Jesus said to him, &amp;apos;Do you truly long to be well?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">The sick man answered, &amp;apos;Sir, there&amp;quot;s no way I can get healed, for I have no one to lower me into the water when the angel comes. As soon as I try to crawl to the edge of the pool, someone else jumps in ahead of me.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Jesus said to him, &amp;apos;Stand up! Pick up your sleeping mat and you will walk!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Immediately he stood up&amp;ndash;he was healed! So he rolled up his mat and walked again! Now Jesus worked this miracle on the Sabbath.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">When the Jewish leaders saw the man walking along carrying his sleeping mat, they objected and said, &amp;apos;What are you doing carrying that? Don&amp;quot;t you know it&amp;quot;s the Sabbath? It&amp;quot;s not lawful for you to carry things on the Sabbath!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">He answered them, &amp;apos;The man who healed me told me to pick it up and walk.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">&amp;apos;What man?&amp;apos; they asked him. &amp;apos;Who was this man who ordered you to carry something on a Sabbath?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">But the healed man couldn&amp;quot;t give them an answer, for he didn&amp;quot;t yet know who it was, since Jesus had already slipped away into the crowd.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">A short time later, Jesus found the man at the temple and said to him, &amp;apos;Look at you now! You&amp;quot;re healed! Walk away from your sin so that nothing worse will happen to you.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Then the man went to the Jewish leaders to inform them, &amp;apos;It was Jesus who healed me!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">From that day forward the Jewish leaders began to persecute Jesus because of the things he did on the Sabbath.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Jesus answered his critics by saying, &amp;apos;Every day my Father is at work, and I will be, too!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">This infuriated them and made them all the more eager to devise a plan to kill him. For not only did he break their Sabbath rules, but he also called God &amp;apos;my Father,&amp;apos; which made him equal to God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">So Jesus said, &amp;apos;I speak to you eternal truth. The Son is unable to do anything from himself or through his own initiative. I only do the works that I see the Father doing, for the Son does the same works as his Father.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">&amp;apos;Because the Father loves his Son so much, he always reveals to him everything that he is about to do. And you will all be amazed when he shows him even greater works than what you&amp;quot;ve seen so far!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">For just as the Father has power to raise the dead, the Son will also raise the dead and give life to whomever he wants.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">&amp;apos;The Father judges no one, for he has given to the Son all the authority to judge.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">Therefore, the honor that belongs to the Father he will now share with his Son. So if you refuse to honor the Son, you are refusing to honor the Father who sent him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">&amp;apos;I speak to you an eternal truth: if you embrace my message and believe in the One who sent me, you will never face condemnation. In me, you have already passed from the realm of death into eternal life!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">&amp;apos;I speak to you an eternal truth: Soon the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God, and those who listen will arise with life!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">For as the Father is the source of life, so he has given the Son the power to impart life.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">The Father has transferred to the Son the authority to judge, because he is the Son of Man.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">&amp;apos;Don&amp;quot;t be amazed when I tell you these things, for there is a day coming when everyone who has ever died will hear my voice calling them back to life,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">and they will come out of their graves! Those who have done what is good will experience a resurrection to eternal life. And those who have practiced evil will taste the resurrection of judgment!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">&amp;apos;Nothing I do is from my own initiative. As I hear the judgment passed by my Father, I execute those judgments. And my judgments will be perfect, because I seek only to fulfill the desires of my Father who sent me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">If I were to make claims about myself, you would have reasons to doubt.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">But there is another who bears witness on my behalf, and I know that what he testifies of me is true.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">&amp;apos;You have sent messengers to John, and what he testified about me is true.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">I have no need to be validated by men, but I&amp;quot;m explaining these things so that you will believe and be saved.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">&amp;apos;John was a blazing, shining torch, and for a short time, you basked in his light with great joy.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">But I can provide more substantial proof of who I am that exceeds John&amp;quot;s testimony&amp;ndash;my miracles! These works which the Father destined for me to complete&amp;ndash;they prove that the Father has sent me!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">And my Father himself, who gave me this mission, has also testified that I am his Son. But you have never heard his voice nor seen his form,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">nor does his Word truly live inside of you, for you refuse to believe in me or to embrace me as God&amp;quot;s messenger.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">&amp;apos;You are busy analyzing the Scriptures, poring over them hoping to gain eternal life. Everything you read points to me,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">yet you still refuse to come to me so I can give you the life you&amp;quot;re looking for&amp;ndash;eternal life!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">&amp;apos;I do not accept the honor that comes from men,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">for I know what kind of people you really are, and I can see that the love of God has found no home in you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43">I have come to represent my Father, yet you refuse to embrace me in faith. If someone comes in their own name and with their own agenda , you readily accept him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44">Of course you&amp;quot;re unable to believe in me. For you live to enjoy the praises of others and not the praise that comes from the one true God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45">&amp;apos;I will not accuse you before the Father. The one who will incriminate you is Moses, the very one you claim to obey, the one in whom you trust!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46">If you really believed what Moses has written, then you would embrace me, for Moses wrote about me!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="47">But since you do not believe what he wrote, no wonder you don&amp;quot;t believe what I say.&amp;apos;</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="6">
			<VERS vnumber="1">After this Jesus went to the other side of the Lake of Tiberias, which is also known as Lake Galilee.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">And a massive crowd of people followed him everywhere. They were attracted by his miracles and the healings they watched him perform.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Jesus went up the slope of a hill and sat down with his disciples.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Now it was approaching the time of the Jewish celebration of Passover, and there were many pilgrims on their way to Jerusalem in the crowd .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">As Jesus sat down, he looked out and saw the massive crowd of people scrambling up the hill, for they wanted to be near him. So he turned to Philip and said, &amp;apos;Where will we buy enough food to feed all these people?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Now Jesus already knew what he was about to do, but he said this to stretch Philip&amp;quot;s faith.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Philip answered, &amp;apos;Well, I suppose if we were to give everyone only a snack, it would cost thousands of dollars to buy enough food!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">But just then, Andrew, Peter&amp;quot;s brother, spoke up and said,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">&amp;apos;Look! Here&amp;quot;s a young person with five barley loaves and two small fish . . . but how far would that go with this huge crowd?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">&amp;apos;Have everyone sit down,&amp;apos; Jesus said to his disciples. So on the vast grassy slope, more than five thousand hungry people sat down.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Jesus then took the barley loaves and the fish and gave thanks to God. He then gave it to the disciples to distribute to the people. Miraculously, the food multiplied, with everyone eating as much as they wanted!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">When everyone was satisfied, Jesus told his disciples, &amp;apos;Now go back and gather up the pieces left over so that nothing will be wasted.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">The disciples filled up twelve baskets of fragments, a basket of leftovers for each disciple .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">All the people were astounded as they saw with their own eyes the incredible miracle Jesus had performed! They began to say among themselves, &amp;apos;He really is the One&amp;ndash;the true prophet we&amp;quot;ve been expecting!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">So Jesus, knowing that they were about to take him and make him their king by force, quickly left and went up the mountainside alone.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">By now a strong wind began to blow and was stirring up the waters.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">The disciples had rowed about halfway across the lake when all of a sudden they caught sight of Jesus walking on top of the waves, coming toward them. The disciples panicked,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">but Jesus called out to them, &amp;apos;Don&amp;quot;t be afraid. You know who I am.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">They were relieved to take him in, and the moment Jesus stepped into the boat, they were instantly transported to the other side!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">So when the people saw on the shoreline a number of small boats from Tiberias and realized Jesus and the disciples weren&amp;quot;t there, they got into the boats and went to Capernaum to search for him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">When they finally found him, they asked him, &amp;apos;Teacher, how did you get here?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">Jesus replied, &amp;apos;Let me make this very clear, you came looking for me because I fed you by a miracle, not because you believe in me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">Why would you strive for food that is perishable and not be passionate to seek the food of eternal life, which never spoils? I, the Son of Man, am ready to give you what matters most, for God the Father has destined me for this purpose.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">They replied, &amp;apos;So what should we do if we want to do God&amp;quot;s work?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">Jesus answered, &amp;apos;The work you can do for God starts with believing in the One he has sent.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">&amp;apos;The truth is,&amp;apos; Jesus said, &amp;apos;Moses didn&amp;quot;t give you the bread of heaven. It&amp;quot;s my Father who offers bread that comes as a dramatic sign from heaven.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">The bread of God is the One who came out of heaven to give his life to feed the world.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">&amp;apos;Then please, sir, give us this bread every day,&amp;apos; they replied.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">Jesus said to them, &amp;apos;I am the Bread of Life. Come every day to me and you will never be hungry. Believe in me and you will never be thirsty.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">Yet I&amp;quot;ve told you that even though you&amp;quot;ve seen me, you still don&amp;quot;t believe in me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">But everyone my Father has given to me, they will come. And all who come to me, I will embrace and will never turn them away.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">And I have come out of heaven not for my own desires, but for the satisfaction of my Father who sent me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">My Father who sent me has determined that I will not lose even one of those he has given to me, and I will raise them up in the last day.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">For the longing of my Father is that everyone who embraces the Son and believes in him will experience eternal life and I will raise them up in the last day!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">When the Jews who were hostile to Jesus heard him say, &amp;apos;I am the Bread that came down from heaven,&amp;apos; they immediately began to complain,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">&amp;apos;How can he say these things about himself? We know him, and we know his parents. How dare he say, &amp;quot;I have come down from heaven?&amp;quot; &amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43">Jesus responded, &amp;apos;Stop your grumbling!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44">The only way people come to me is by the Father who sent me&amp;ndash;he pulls on their hearts to embrace me. And those who are drawn to me, I will certainly raise them up in the last day.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45">Jesus continued, &amp;apos;It has been written by the prophets, &amp;quot;They will all be taught by God himself.&amp;quot; If you are really listening to the Father and learning directly from him, you will come to me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46">For I am the only One who has come from the Father&amp;quot;s side, and I have seen the Father!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="47">&amp;apos;I speak to you living truth: Unite your heart to me and believe&amp;ndash;and you will experience eternal life!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="48">I am the true Bread of Life.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="49">Your ancestors ate manna in the desert and died.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="50">But standing here before you is the true Bread that comes out of heaven, and when you eat this Bread you will never die.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="51">I alone am this living Bread that has come to you from heaven. Eat this Bread and you will live forever. The living Bread I give you is my body, which I will offer as a sacrifice so that all may live.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="52">These words of Jesus sparked an angry outburst among the Jews. They protested, saying, &amp;apos;Does this man expect us to eat his body?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="53">Jesus replied to them, &amp;apos;Listen to this eternal truth: Unless you eat the body of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you will not have eternal life.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="54">Eternal life comes to the one who eats my body and drinks my blood, and I will raise him up in the last day.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="55">For my body is real food for your spirit and my blood is real drink.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="56">The one who eats my body and drinks my blood lives in me and I live in him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="57">The Father of life sent me, and he is my life. In the same way, the one who feeds upon me, I will become his life.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="58">I am not like the bread your ancestors ate and later died. I am the living Bread that comes from heaven. Eat this Bread and you will live forever!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="59">Jesus preached this sermon in the synagogue in Capernaum.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="60">And when many of Jesus&amp;quot; followers heard these things, it caused a stir. &amp;apos;That&amp;quot;s disgusting!&amp;apos; they said. &amp;apos;How could anybody accept it?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="61">Without anyone telling him, Jesus knew they were outraged and told them, &amp;apos;Are you offended over my teaching?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="62">What will you do when you see the Son of Man ascending into the realm from where he came?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="63">&amp;apos;The Holy Spirit is the one who gives life, that which is of the natural realm is of no help. The words I speak to you are Spirit and life. But there are still some of you who won&amp;quot;t believe.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="64">In fact, Jesus already knew from the beginning who the skeptics were and who his traitor would be.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="65">He went on to say, &amp;apos;This is why I told you that no one embraces me unless the Father has given you to me.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="66">And so from that time on many of the disciples turned their backs on Jesus and refused to be associated with him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="67">So Jesus said to his twelve, &amp;apos;And you&amp;ndash;do you also want to leave?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="68">Peter spoke up and said, &amp;apos;But Lord, where would we go? No one but you gives us the revelation of eternal life.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="69">We&amp;quot;re fully convinced that you are the Anointed One, the Son of the Living God, and we believe in you!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="70">Then Jesus shocked them with these words: &amp;apos;I have hand-picked you to be my twelve, knowing that one of you is the devil.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="71">Jesus was referring to Judas Iscariot, son of Simon, for he knew that Judas, one of his chosen disciples, was getting ready to betray him.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="7">
			<VERS vnumber="1">After this Jesus traveled extensively throughout the province of Galilee, but he avoided the province of Judea, for he knew the Jewish leaders in Jerusalem were plotting to have him killed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Now the annual Feast of Tabernacles was approaching.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">So Jesus&amp;quot; brothers came to advise him, saying, &amp;apos;Why don&amp;quot;t you leave the countryside villages and go to Judea where the crowds are, so that your followers can see your miracles?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">No one can see what you&amp;quot;re doing here in the backwoods of Galilee. How do you expect to be successful and famous if you do all these things in secret? Now is your time&amp;ndash;go to Jerusalem, come out of hiding, and show the world who you are!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">His brothers were pushing him, even though they didn&amp;quot;t yet believe in him as the Savior.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Jesus responded, &amp;apos;My time of being unveiled hasn&amp;quot;t yet come, but any time is a suitable opportunity for you to gain man&amp;quot;s approval.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">The world can&amp;quot;t hate you, but it does me, for I am exposing their evil deeds.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">You can go ahead and celebrate the feast without me&amp;ndash;my appointed time has not yet come.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">During the feast, the Jewish leaders kept looking for Jesus and asking around, &amp;apos;Where is he? Have you seen him?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">A controversy was brewing among the people, with so many differing opinions about Jesus. Some were saying, &amp;apos;He&amp;quot;s a good man!&amp;apos; While others weren&amp;quot;t convinced and insisted, saying, &amp;apos;He&amp;quot;s just a demagogue.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Yet no one was bold enough to speak out publicly on Jesus&amp;quot; behalf for fear of the Jewish leaders.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Not until the feast was half over did Jesus finally appear in the temple courts and begin to teach.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">The Jewish leaders were astonished by what he taught and said, &amp;apos;How did this man acquire such knowledge? He wasn&amp;quot;t trained in our schools&amp;ndash;who taught him?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">So Jesus responded, &amp;apos;I don&amp;quot;t teach my own ideas, but the truth revealed to me by the One who sent me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">If you want to test my teachings and discover where I received them, first be passionate to do God&amp;quot;s will, and then you will be able to discern if my teachings are from the heart of God or from my own opinions.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Charlatans praise themselves and seek honor from men, but my Father sent me to speak truth on his behalf. And I have no false motive, because I seek only the glory of God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Moses has given you the law, but not one of you is faithful to keep it. So if you are all law-breakers, why then would you seek to kill me?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Then some in the crowd shouted out, &amp;apos;You must be out of your mind! Who&amp;quot;s trying to kill you?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Jesus replied, &amp;apos;I only had to do one miracle, and all of you marvel!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Yet isn&amp;quot;t it true that Moses and your forefathers ordered you to circumcise your sons even if the eighth day fell on a Sabbath?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">So if you cut away part of a man on the Sabbath and that doesn&amp;quot;t break the Jewish law, why then would you be indignant with me for making a man completely healed on the Sabbath?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">Stop judging based on the superficial. First you must embrace the standards of mercy and truth.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">Then some of the residents of Jerusalem spoke up and said, &amp;apos;Isn&amp;quot;t this the one they&amp;quot;re trying to kill?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">So why is he here speaking publicly and not one of the Jewish leaders is doing anything about it? Are they starting to think that he&amp;quot;s the Anointed One?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">But how could he be, since we know this man is from Galilee, but no one will know where the true Messiah comes from, he&amp;quot;ll just appear out of nowhere.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">Knowing all of this, Jesus one day preached boldly in the temple courts, &amp;apos;So, you think you know me and where I come from? But you don&amp;quot;t know the One who sent me&amp;ndash;the Father who is always faithful. I have not come simply on my own initiative.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">The Father has sent me here, and I know all about him, for I have come from his presence.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">His words caused many to want to arrest him, but no man was able to lay a hand on him, for it wasn&amp;quot;t yet his appointed time.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">And there were many people who thought he might be the Messiah. They said, &amp;apos;After all, when the Anointed One appears, could he possibly do more signs and wonders than this man has done?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">So when the Pharisees heard these rumors circulating about Jesus, they went with the leading priests and the temple guards to arrest him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">Then Jesus said, &amp;apos;My days to be with you are numbered. Then I will return to the One who sent me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">And you will search for me and not be able to find me. For where I am, you cannot come.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">When the Jewish leaders heard this, they discussed among themselves, &amp;apos;Where could he possibly go that we won&amp;quot;t be able to find him? Is he going to minister in a different land where our people live scattered among the nations? Is he going to teach those who are not Jews?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">What did he really mean by his statement, &amp;quot;You will search for me and won&amp;quot;t be able to find me. And where I am you can&amp;quot;t come&amp;quot;?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">Then on the most important day of the feast, the last day, Jesus stood and shouted out to the crowds&amp;ndash; &amp;apos;All you thirsty ones, come to me! Come to me and drink!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">Believe in me so that rivers of living water will burst out from within you, flowing from your innermost being, just like the Scripture says!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">Jesus was prophesying about the Holy Spirit that believers were being prepared to receive. But the Holy Spirit had not yet been poured out upon them, because Jesus had not yet been unveiled in his full splendor.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">When the crowd heard Jesus&amp;quot; words, some said, &amp;apos;This man really is a prophet!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">Others said, &amp;apos;He&amp;quot;s the Messiah!&amp;apos; But others said, &amp;apos;How could he be the Anointed One since he&amp;quot;s from Galilee?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">Don&amp;quot;t the Scriptures say that he will be one of David&amp;quot;s descendants and be born in Bethlehem, the city of David?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43">So the crowd was divided over Jesus,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44">some wanted him arrested but no one dared to lay a hand on him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45">So when the temple guards returned to the Pharisees and the leading priests without Jesus, they were questioned, &amp;apos;Where is he? Why didn&amp;quot;t you bring that man back with you?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46">They answered, &amp;apos;You don&amp;quot;t understand&amp;ndash;he speaks amazing things like no one else has ever spoken!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="47">The religious leaders mocked, &amp;apos;Oh, so now you also have been led astray by him?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="48">Do you see even one of us, your leaders, following him?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="49">This ignorant rabble swarms around him because none of them know anything about the Law! They&amp;quot;re all cursed!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="50">Just then, Nicodemus, who had secretly spent time with Jesus, spoke up, for he was a respected voice among them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="51">He cautioned them, saying, &amp;apos;Does our law decide a man&amp;quot;s guilt before we first hear him and allow him to defend himself?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="52">They argued, &amp;apos;Oh, so now you&amp;quot;re an advocate for this Galilean! Search the Scriptures, Nicodemus, and you&amp;quot;ll see that there&amp;quot;s no mention of a prophet coming out of Galilee!&amp;apos; So with that their debate ended ,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="53">and they each went their own way.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="8">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Jesus walked up the Mount of Olives near the city where he spent the night .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Then at dawn Jesus appeared in the temple courts again, and soon all the people gathered around to listen to his words, so he sat down and taught them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Then in the middle of his teaching, the religious scholars and the Pharisees broke through the crowd and brought a woman who had been caught in the act of committing adultery and made her stand in the middle of everyone.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Then they said to Jesus, &amp;apos;Teacher, we caught this woman in the very act of adultery.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Doesn&amp;quot;t Moses&amp;quot; law command us to stone to death a woman like this? Tell us, what do you say we should do with her?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">They were only testing Jesus because they hoped to trap him with his own words and accuse him of breaking the laws of Moses . But Jesus didn&amp;quot;t answer them. Instead he simply bent down and wrote in the dust with his finger. Jesus said, &amp;apos;Then I certainly don&amp;quot;t condemn you either. Go, and from now on, be free from a life of sin.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Angry, they kept insisting that he answer their question, so Jesus stood up and looked at them and said, &amp;apos;Let&amp;quot;s have the man who has never had a sinful desire throw the first stone at her.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">And then he bent over again and wrote some more words in the dust.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Upon hearing that, her accusers slowly left the crowd one at a time, beginning with the oldest to the youngest, with a convicted conscience.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Until finally, Jesus was left alone with the woman still standing there in front of him. So he stood back up and said to her, &amp;apos;Dear woman, where are your accusers? Is there no one here to condemn you?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Looking around, she replied, &amp;apos;I see no one, Lord.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Then Jesus said, &amp;apos;I am light to the world, and those who embrace me will experience life-giving light, and they will never walk in darkness.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">The Pharisees were immediately offended and said, &amp;apos;You&amp;quot;re just boasting about yourself! Since we only have your word on this, it makes your testimony invalid!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Jesus responded, &amp;apos;Just because I am the one making these claims doesn&amp;quot;t mean they&amp;quot;re invalid. For I absolutely know who I am , where I&amp;quot;ve come from, and where I&amp;quot;m going. But you Pharisees have no idea about what I&amp;quot;m saying.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">For you&amp;quot;ve set yourselves up as judges of others based on outward appearances, but I certainly never judge others in that way.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">For I discern the truth. And I am not alone in my judgments, for my Father and I have the same understanding in all things, and he has sent me to you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">&amp;apos;Isn&amp;quot;t it written in the law of Moses that the testimony of two men is trustworthy?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Then what I say about who I am is true, for I am not alone in my testimony&amp;ndash;my Father is the other witness, and we testify together of the truth.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Then they asked, &amp;apos;Just who is this &amp;quot;Father&amp;quot; of yours? Where is he?&amp;apos; Jesus answered, &amp;apos;You wouldn&amp;quot;t ask that question if you knew who I am, or my Father. For if you knew me, you would recognize my Father too.&amp;apos; &amp;apos;I am the One I&amp;quot;ve always claimed to be.&amp;apos; Jesus replied. Jesus said, &amp;apos;If you are really Abraham&amp;quot;s sons, then you would follow in the steps of Abraham. Indignant, they responded, &amp;apos;What are you talking about? We only have one Father, God himself! We&amp;quot;re not illegitimate!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">(Jesus taught all these things while standing in the treasure room of the temple . And no one dared to arrest him, for it wasn&amp;quot;t yet his time to surrender to men.)</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">One day Jesus said again, &amp;apos;I am about to leave you. You will want to find me, but you will still die in your sins. You won&amp;quot;t be able to come where I am going.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">This so confused the Jewish leaders that they began to say, &amp;apos;Is he planning to commit suicide? What&amp;quot;s he talking about&amp;ndash;&amp;quot;You won&amp;quot;t be able to come where I am going&amp;quot;?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">Jesus spoke up and said, &amp;apos;You are all from the earth; I am from above. I am not from this world like you are.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">That&amp;quot;s why I&amp;quot;ve told you that you will all die in your sins if you fail to believe that I AM who I AM.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">So they asked him plainly, &amp;apos;Who are you?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">&amp;apos;And I still have many more things to pronounce in judgment about you. For I will testify to the world of the truths that I have heard from my Father, and the Father who sent me is trustworthy.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">(Even after all of this, they still didn&amp;quot;t realize that he was speaking about his heavenly Father.)</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">&amp;apos;You will know me as &amp;quot;I AM&amp;quot; after you have lifted me up from the earth as the Son of Man. Then you will realize that I do nothing on my own initiative, but I only speak the truth that the Father has revealed to me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">I am his messenger and he is always with me, for I only do that which delights his heart.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">These words caused many respected Jews to believe in him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">Jesus said to those Jews who believed in him, &amp;apos;When you continue to embrace all that I teach, you prove that you are my true followers.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">For if you embrace the truth, it will release true freedom into your lives.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">Surprised by this, they said, &amp;apos;But we&amp;quot;re the descendants of Abraham and we&amp;quot;re already free. We&amp;quot;ve never been in bondage to anyone. How could you say that we will be released into more freedom?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">&amp;apos;I speak eternal truth,&amp;apos; Jesus said. &amp;apos;When you sin you are not free. You&amp;quot;ve become a slave in bondage to your sin.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">And slaves have no permanent standing in a family, like a son does, for a son is a part of the family forever.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">So if the Son sets you free from sin, then become a true son and be unquestionably free!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">Even though you are descendants of Abraham, you desire to kill me because the message I bring has not found a home in your hearts.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">Yet the truths I speak I&amp;quot;ve seen and received in my Father&amp;quot;s presence. But you are doing what you&amp;quot;ve learned from your father!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">&amp;apos;What do you mean?&amp;apos; they replied. &amp;apos;Abraham is our father!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">I&amp;quot;ve only told you the truth that I&amp;quot;ve heard in my Father&amp;quot;s presence, but now you are wanting me dead&amp;ndash;is that how Abraham acted?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">No, you people are doing what your father has taught you!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">Jesus said, &amp;apos;Then if God were really your father, you would love me, for I&amp;quot;ve come from his presence. I didn&amp;quot;t come here on my own, but God sent me to you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43">Why don&amp;quot;t you understand what I say? You don&amp;quot;t understand because your hearts are closed to my message!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44">&amp;apos;You are the offspring of your father, the devil, and you serve your father very well, passionately carrying out his desires. He&amp;quot;s been a murderer right from the start! He never stood with the truth, for he&amp;quot;s full of nothing but lies&amp;ndash;lying is his native tongue. He is a master of deception and the father of lies!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45">But I am the true Prince who speaks nothing but the truth, yet you refuse to believe and you want nothing to do with me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46">Can you name one sin that I&amp;quot;ve committed? Then if I am telling you only the truth, why don&amp;quot;t you believe me?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="47">If you really knew God, you would listen, receive, and respond with faith to his words. But since you don&amp;quot;t listen and respond to what he says, it proves you don&amp;quot;t belong to him and you have no room for him in your hearts.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="48">&amp;apos;See! We were right all along!&amp;apos; some of the Jewish leaders shouted. &amp;apos;You&amp;quot;re nothing but a demon-possessed Samaritan!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="49">Jesus replied, &amp;apos;It is not a demon that would cause me to honor my Father. I live my life for his honor, even though you insult me for it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="50">I never have a need to seek my own glory, for the Father will do that for me, and he will judge those who do not.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="51">I speak to you this eternal truth: whoever cherishes my words and keeps them will never experience death.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="52">This prompted the Jewish leaders to say, &amp;apos;Now we know for sure that you&amp;quot;re demon possessed! You just said that those who keep watch over your words will never experience death, but Abraham and all the prophets have died!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="53">Do you think you&amp;quot;re greater than our father Abraham and all the prophets? You are so delusional about yourself that you make yourself greater than you are!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="54">Jesus answered them, &amp;apos;If I were to tell you how great I am, it would mean nothing. But my Father is the One who will prove it and will glorify me. Isn&amp;quot;t he the One you claim is your God?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="55">But in reality, you&amp;quot;ve never embraced him as your own. I know him, and I would be a liar, like yourselves, if I told you anything less than that. I have fully embraced him, and I treasure his every word.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="56">And not only that, Abraham, your ancestor, was overjoyed when he received the revelation of my coming to earth. Yes, he foresaw me coming and was filled with delight!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="57">But many of the Jewish leaders doubted him and said, &amp;apos;What are you talking about? You&amp;quot;re not even fifty years old yet. You talk like you&amp;quot;ve seen Abraham!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="58">Jesus said to them, &amp;apos;I give you this eternal truth: I have existed long before Abraham was born, for I AM!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="59">When they heard this, they picked up rocks to stone him, but Jesus concealed himself as he passed through the crowd and went away from there.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="9">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Afterward, as Jesus walked down the street, he noticed a man blind from birth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">His disciples asked him, &amp;apos;Teacher, whose sin caused this guy&amp;quot;s blindness, his own, or the sin of his parents?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Jesus answered, &amp;apos;Neither. It happened to him so that you could watch him experience God&amp;quot;s miracle.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">While I am with you, it is daytime and we must do the works of God who sent me while the light shines. For there is coming a dark night when no one will be able to work.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">As long as I am with you my life is the light that pierces the world&amp;quot;s darkness.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Then Jesus spat on the ground and made some clay with his saliva. Then he anointed the blind man&amp;quot;s eyes with the clay.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">And he said to the blind man, &amp;apos;Now go and wash the clay from your eyes in the ritual pool of Siloam.&amp;apos; So he went and washed his face and as he came back, he could see for the first time in his life!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">This caused quite a stir among the people of the neighborhood, for they noticed the blind beggar was now seeing! They began to say to one another, &amp;apos;Isn&amp;quot;t this the blind man who once sat and begged?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Some said, &amp;apos;No, it can&amp;quot;t be him!&amp;apos; Others said, &amp;apos;But it looks just like him&amp;ndash;it has to be him!&amp;apos; All the while the man kept insisting, &amp;apos;I&amp;quot;m the man who was blind!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Finally, they asked him, &amp;apos;What has happened to you?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">He replied, &amp;apos;I met the man named Jesus! He rubbed clay on my eyes and said, &amp;quot;Go to the pool named Siloam and wash.&amp;quot; So I went and while I was washing the clay from my eyes I began to see for the very first time ever! &amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">So the people of the neighborhood inquired, &amp;apos;Where is this man?&amp;apos; &amp;apos;I have no idea.&amp;apos; the man replied. He replied, &amp;apos;A man anointed my eyes with clay, then I washed, and now I can see for the first time in my life!&amp;apos; &amp;apos;He&amp;quot;s a prophet of God!&amp;apos; the man replied. &amp;apos;Yes,&amp;apos; they answered. &amp;apos;Was he really born blind?&amp;apos; &amp;apos;Yes, he was,&amp;apos; they replied. So they pressed his parents to answer, &amp;apos;Then how is it that he&amp;quot;s now seeing?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">So the people marched him over to the Pharisees to speak with them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">They were concerned because the miracle Jesus performed by making clay with his saliva and anointing the man&amp;quot;s eyes happened on a Sabbath day, a day that no one was allowed to &amp;apos;work.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Then the Pharisees asked the man, &amp;apos;How did you have your sight restored?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Then an argument broke out among the Pharisees over the healing of the blind man on the Sabbath. Some said, &amp;apos;This man who performed this healing is clearly not from God! He doesn&amp;quot;t even observe the Sabbath!&amp;apos; Others said, &amp;apos;If Jesus is just an ordinary sinner, how could he perform a miracle like that?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">This prompted them to turn on the man healed of blindness, putting him on the spot in front of them all, demanding an answer. They asked, &amp;apos;Who do you say he is&amp;ndash;this man who opened your blind eyes?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Still refusing to believe that the man had been healed and was truly blind from birth, the Jewish leaders called for the man&amp;quot;s parents to be brought to them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">&amp;apos;We have no idea,&amp;apos; they answered. &amp;apos;We don&amp;quot;t know what happened to our son. Ask him, he&amp;quot;s a mature adult. He can speak for himself.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">(Now the parents were obviously intimidated by the Jewish religious leaders, for they had already announced to the people that if anyone publicly confessed Jesus as the Messiah, they would be excommunicated.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">That&amp;quot;s why they told them, &amp;apos;Ask him, he&amp;quot;s a mature adult. He can speak for himself.&amp;apos;)</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">So once again they summoned the man who was healed of blindness and said to him, &amp;apos;Swear to God to tell us the truth! We know the man who healed you is a sinful man! Do you agree?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">The healed man replied, &amp;apos;I have no idea what kind of man he is. All I know is that I was blind and now I can see for the first time in my life!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">&amp;apos;But what did he do to you?&amp;apos; they asked. &amp;apos;How did he heal you?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">The man responded, &amp;apos;I told you once and you didn&amp;quot;t listen to me. Why do you make me repeat it? Are you wanting to be his followers too?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">This angered the Jewish leaders. They heaped insults on him, &amp;apos;We can tell you are one of his followers&amp;ndash;now we know it! We are true followers of Moses,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">for we know that God spoke to Moses directly. But as for this one, we don&amp;quot;t know where he&amp;quot;s coming from!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">&amp;apos;Well, what a surprise this is!&amp;apos; the man said. &amp;apos;You don&amp;quot;t even know where he comes from, but he healed my eyes and now I can see!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">We know that God doesn&amp;quot;t listen to sinners, but only to godly people who do his will.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">Yet who has ever heard of a man born blind that was healed and given his eyesight for the very first time?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">I tell you, if this man isn&amp;quot;t from God, he wouldn&amp;quot;t be able to heal me like he has!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">Some of the Jewish leaders were enraged and said, &amp;apos;Just who do you think you are to lecture us! You were born a blind, filthy sinner!&amp;apos; So they threw the man out in the street.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">When Jesus learned they had thrown him out, he went to find him and said to him, &amp;apos;Do you believe in the Son of God?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">The man whose blind eyes were healed answered, &amp;apos;Who is he, Master? Tell me so that I can place all my faith in him.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">Jesus replied, &amp;apos;You&amp;quot;re looking right at him. He&amp;quot;s speaking with you. It&amp;quot;s me, the one in front of you now.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">Then the man threw himself at his feet and worshiped Jesus and said, &amp;apos;Lord, I believe in you!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">And Jesus said, &amp;apos;I have come to judge those who think they see and make them blind. And for those who are blind, I have come to make them see.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">Some of the Pharisees were standing nearby and overheard these words. They interrupted Jesus and said, &amp;apos;You mean to tell us that we are blind?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">Jesus told them, &amp;apos;If you would acknowledge your blindness, then your sin would be removed. But now that you claim to see, your sin remains with you!&amp;apos;</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="10">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Jesus said to the Pharisees , &amp;apos;Listen to this eternal truth: The person who sneaks over the wall to enter into the sheep pen, rather than coming through the gate, reveals himself as a thief coming to steal.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">But the true Shepherd walks right up to the gate,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">and because the gatekeeper knows who he is, he opens the gate to let him in. And the sheep recognize the voice of the true Shepherd, for he calls his own by name and leads them out, for they belong to him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">And when he has brought out all his sheep, he walks ahead of them and they will follow him, for they are familiar with his voice.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">But they will run away from strangers and never follow them because they know it&amp;quot;s the voice of a stranger.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Jesus told the Pharisees this parable even though they didn&amp;quot;t understand a word of what he meant.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">So Jesus went over it again, &amp;apos;I speak to you eternal truth: I am the Gate for the flock.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">All those who broke in before me are thieves who came to steal, but the sheep never listened to them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">I am the Gateway. To enter through me is to experience life, freedom, and satisfaction.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">A thief has only one thing in mind&amp;ndash;he wants to steal, slaughter, and destroy. But I have come to give you everything in abundance, more than you expect &amp;ndash;life in its fullness until you overflow!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">I am the Good Shepherd who lays down my life as a sacrifice for the sheep.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">&amp;apos;I alone am the Good Shepherd, and I know those whose hearts are mine, for they recognize me and know me,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">just as my Father knows my heart and I know my Father&amp;quot;s heart. I am ready to give my life for the sheep.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">&amp;apos;And I have other sheep that I will gather which are not of this Jewish flock. And I, their shepherd, must lead them too, and they will follow me and listen to my voice. And I will join them all into one flock with one shepherd.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">&amp;apos;The Father has an intense love for me because I freely give my own life&amp;ndash;to raise it up again.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">I surrender my own life, and no one has the power to take my life from me. I have the authority to lay it down and the power to take it back again. This is the destiny my Father has set before me.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">This teaching set off another heated controversy among the Jewish leaders.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Many of them said, &amp;apos;This man is a demon-possessed lunatic! Why would anyone listen to a word he says?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">But then there were others who weren&amp;quot;t so sure: &amp;apos;His teaching is full of insight. These are not the ravings of a madman! How could a demonized man give sight to one born blind?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">when the Jewish leaders encircled him and said, &amp;apos;How much longer will you keep us in suspense? Tell us the truth and clarify this for us once and for all. Are you really the Messiah, the Anointed One?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">Jesus answered them, &amp;apos;I have told you the truth already and you did not believe me. The proof of who I am is revealed by all the miracles that I do in the name of my Father.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">Yet, you stubbornly refuse to follow me, because you are not my sheep. As I&amp;quot;ve told you before:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">My own sheep will hear my voice and I know each one, and they will follow me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">I give to them the gift of eternal life and they will never be lost and no one has the power to snatch them out of my hands.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">My Father, who has given them to me as his gift, is the mightiest of all, and no one has the power to snatch them from my Father&amp;quot;s care.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">The Father and I are one.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">When they heard this, the Jewish leaders were so enraged that they picked up rocks to stone him to death.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">But Jesus said, &amp;apos;My Father has empowered me to work many miracles and acts of mercy among you. So which one of them do you want to stone me for?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">The Jewish leaders responded, &amp;apos;We&amp;quot;re not stoning you for anything good you did&amp;ndash;it&amp;quot;s because of your blasphemy! You&amp;quot;re just a son of Adam , but you&amp;quot;ve claimed to be God!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">Jesus answered, &amp;apos;Isn&amp;quot;t it written in your Scriptures that God said, &amp;quot;You are gods?&amp;quot; The Scriptures cannot be denied or found to be in error.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">So if those who have the message of the Scriptures are said to be &amp;quot;gods,&amp;quot; then why would you accuse me of blasphemy?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">For I have been uniquely chosen by God and he is the one who sent me to you. How then could it be blasphemy for me to say, &amp;quot;I am the Son of God!&amp;quot;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">If I&amp;quot;m not doing the beautiful works that my Father sent me to do, then don&amp;quot;t believe me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">But if you see me doing the beautiful works of God upon the earth, then you should at least believe the evidence of the miracles, even if you don&amp;quot;t believe my words! Then you would come to experience me and be convinced that I am in the Father and the Father is in me.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">Once again they attempted to seize him, but he escaped miraculously from their clutches.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">Then Jesus went back to the place where John had baptized him at the crossing of the Jordan.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">Many came out to where he was and said about him, &amp;apos;Even though John didn&amp;quot;t perform any miracles, everything he predicted about this man is true!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">And many people became followers of Jesus at the Jordan and believed in him.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="11">
			<VERS vnumber="3">So his sisters sent a message to Jesus, &amp;apos;Lord, our brother Lazarus, the one you love, is very sick. Please come!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">When he heard this, he said, &amp;apos;This sickness will not end in death for Lazarus, but will bring glory and praise to God. This will reveal the greatness of the Son of God by what takes place.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Finally, on the third day, he said to his disciples, &amp;apos;Come. It&amp;quot;s time to go to Bethany.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">&amp;apos;But Teacher,&amp;apos; they said to him, &amp;apos;do you really want to go back there? It was just a short time ago the people of Judea were going to stone you!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Then Jesus added, &amp;apos;Lazarus, our friend, has just fallen asleep. It&amp;quot;s time that I go and awaken him.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">When they heard this, the disciples replied, &amp;apos;Lord, if he has just fallen asleep, then he&amp;quot;ll get better.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Jesus was speaking about Lazarus&amp;quot; death, but the disciples presumed he was talking about natural sleep.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Then Jesus made it plain to them, &amp;apos;Lazarus is dead.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">And for your sake, I&amp;quot;m glad I wasn&amp;quot;t there, because now you have another opportunity to see who I am so that you will learn to trust in me. Come, let&amp;quot;s go and see him.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">So Thomas, nicknamed the Twin, remarked to the other disciples, &amp;apos;Let&amp;quot;s go so that we can die with him.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Many friends of Mary and Martha had come from the region to console them over the loss of their brother.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">And when Martha heard that Jesus was approaching the village, she went out to meet him, but Mary stayed in the house.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Martha said to Jesus, &amp;apos;My Lord, if only you had come sooner, my brother wouldn&amp;quot;t have died.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">But I know that if you were to ask God for anything, he would do it for you.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">Jesus told her, &amp;apos;Your brother will rise and live.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">She replied, &amp;apos;Yes, I know he will rise with everyone else on resurrection day.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">&amp;apos;Martha,&amp;apos; Jesus said, &amp;apos; You don&amp;quot;t have to wait until then. I am the Resurrection, and I am Life Eternal. Anyone who clings to me in faith, even though he dies, will live forever.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">And the one who lives by believing in me will never die. Do you believe this?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">Then Martha replied, &amp;apos;Yes, Lord, I do! I&amp;quot;ve always believed that you are the Anointed One, the Son of God who has come into the world for us!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">Then she left and hurried off to her sister, Mary, and called her aside from all the mourners and whispered to her, &amp;apos;The Master is here and he&amp;quot;s asking for you.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">So when Mary heard this, she quickly went off to find him,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">for Jesus was lingering outside the village at the same spot where Martha met him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">Now when Mary&amp;quot;s friends who were comforting her noticed how quickly she ran out of the house, they followed her, assuming she was going to the tomb of her brother to mourn.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">When Mary finally found Jesus outside the village, she fell at his feet in tears and said, &amp;apos;Lord, if only you had been here, my brother would not have died.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">When Jesus looked at Mary and saw her weeping at his feet, and all her friends who were with her grieving, he shuddered with emotion and was deeply moved with tenderness and compassion.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">He said to them, &amp;apos;Where did you bury him?&amp;apos; &amp;apos;Lord, come with us and we&amp;quot;ll show you,&amp;apos; they replied. Then Martha said, &amp;apos;But Lord, it&amp;quot;s been four days since he died&amp;ndash;by now his body is already decomposing!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">Then tears streamed down Jesus&amp;quot; face.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">Seeing Jesus weep caused many of the mourners to say, &amp;apos;Look how much he loved Lazarus.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">Yet others said, &amp;apos;Isn&amp;quot;t this the One who opens blind eyes? Why didn&amp;quot;t he do something to keep Lazarus from dying?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">Then Jesus, with intense emotions, came to the tomb&amp;ndash;a cave with a stone placed over its entrance.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">Jesus told them, &amp;apos;Roll away the stone.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">Jesus looked at her and said, &amp;apos;Didn&amp;quot;t I tell you that if you will believe in me, you will see God unveil his power?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">So they rolled away the heavy stone. Jesus gazed into heaven and said, &amp;apos;Father, thank you that you have heard my prayer,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">for you listen to every word I speak. Now, so that these who stand here with me will believe that you have sent me to the earth as your messenger, I will use the power you have given me. &amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43">Then with a loud voice Jesus shouted with authority: &amp;apos;Lazarus! Come out of the tomb!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44">Then in front of everyone, Lazarus, who had died four days earlier, slowly hobbled out&amp;ndash;he still had grave clothes tightly wrapped around his hands and feet and covering his face! Jesus said to them, &amp;apos;Unwrap him and let him loose.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45">From that day forward many of those who had come to visit Mary believed in him, for they had seen with their own eyes this amazing miracle!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46">But a few went back to inform the Pharisees about what Jesus had done.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="47">So the Pharisees and the chief priests called a special meeting of the High Council and said, &amp;apos;So what are we going to do about this man? Look at all the great miracles he&amp;quot;s performing!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="48">If we allow him to continue like this, everyone will believe in him. And the Romans will take action and destroy both our country and our people!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="49">Now Caiaphas, the high priest that year, spoke up and said, &amp;apos;You don&amp;quot;t understand a thing!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="50">Don&amp;quot;t you realize we&amp;quot;d be much better off if this one man were to die for the people than for the whole nation to perish?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="51">(This prophecy that Jesus was destined to die for the Jewish people didn&amp;quot;t come from Caiaphas himself, but he was moved by God to prophesy as the chief priest.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="52">And Jesus&amp;quot; death would not be for the Jewish people only, but to gather together God&amp;quot;s children scattered around the world and unite them as one.)</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="53">So from that day on, they were committed to killing Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="54">For this reason Jesus no longer went out in public among the Jews. But he went in the wilderness to a village called Ephraim, where he secluded himself with his disciples.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="55">Now the time came for the Passover preparations, and many from the countryside went to Jerusalem for their ceremonial cleansing before the feast began.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="56">And all the people kept looking out for Jesus, expecting him to come to the city. They said to themselves while they waited in the temple courts, &amp;apos;Do you think that he will dare come to the feast?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="57">For the leading priests and the Pharisees had given orders that they be informed immediately if anyone saw Jesus, so they could seize and arrest him.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="12">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Six days before the Passover began, Jesus went back to Bethany, the town where he raised Lazarus from the dead.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">They had prepared a supper for Jesus. Martha served, and Lazarus and Mary were among those at the table.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Mary picked up an alabaster jar filled with nearly a liter of extremely rare and costly perfume&amp;ndash;the purest extract of nard, and she anointed Jesus&amp;quot; feet. Then she wiped them dry with her long hair. And the fragrance of the costly oil filled the house.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">But Judas the locksmith, Simon&amp;quot;s son, the betrayer, spoke up and said,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">&amp;apos;What a waste! We could have sold this perfume for a fortune and given the money to the poor!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">(In fact, Judas had no heart for the poor. He only said this because he was a thief and in charge of the money case. He would steal money whenever he wanted from the funds given to support Jesus&amp;quot; ministry .)</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Jesus said to Judas, &amp;apos;Leave her alone! She has saved it for the time of my burial.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">You&amp;quot;ll always have the poor with you; but you won&amp;quot;t always have me.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">When the word got out that Jesus was not far from Jerusalem, a large crowd came out to see him, and they also wanted to see Lazarus, the man Jesus had raised from the dead.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">This prompted the chief priests to seal their plans to do away with both Jesus and Lazarus,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">for his miracle testimony was irrefutable and was persuading many of the Jews living in Jerusalem to believe in Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">The next day the news that Jesus was on his way to Jerusalem swept through the massive crowd gathered for the feast.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">So they took palm branches and went out to meet him. Everyone was shouting, &amp;apos;Lord, be our Savior! Blessed is the one who comes to us sent from Yahweh , the King of Israel!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Then Jesus found a young donkey and rode on it to fulfill what was prophesied:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">&amp;apos;People of Zion, have no fear! Look&amp;ndash;it&amp;quot;s your king coming to you riding on a young donkey!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Now Jesus&amp;quot; disciples didn&amp;quot;t fully understand the importance of what was taking place, but after he was raised and exalted into glory, they understood how Jesus fulfilled all the prophecies in the Scriptures that were written about him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">All the eyewitnesses of the miracle Jesus performed when he called Lazarus out of the tomb and raised him from the dead kept spreading the news about Jesus to everyone.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">The news of this miracle of resurrection caused the crowds to swell as great numbers of people welcomed him into the city with joy .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">But the Pharisees were disturbed by this and said to each other, &amp;apos;We won&amp;quot;t be able to stop this. The whole world is going to run after him!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Now there were a number of foreigners from among the nations who were worshipers at the feast.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">They went to Philip (who came from the village of Bethsaida in Galilee) and they asked him, &amp;apos;Would you take us to see Jesus? We want to see him.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">So Philip went to find Andrew, and then they both went to inform Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">He replied to them, &amp;apos;Now is the time for the Son of Man to be glorified.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">Let me make this clear: A single grain of wheat will never be more than a single grain of wheat unless it drops into the ground and dies. Because then it sprouts and produces a great harvest of wheat&amp;ndash;all because one grain died.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">&amp;apos;The person who loves his life and pampers himself will miss true life! But the one who detaches his life from this world and abandons himself to me, will find true life and enjoy it forever!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">If you want to be my disciple, follow me and you will go where I am going. And if you truly follow me as my disciple, the Father will shower his favor upon your life.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">&amp;apos;Even though I am torn within, and my soul is in turmoil, I will not ask the Father to rescue me from this hour of trial. For I have come to fulfill my purpose &amp;ndash; to offer myself to God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">So, Father, bring glory to your name!&amp;apos; Then suddenly a booming voice was heard from the sky, &amp;apos;I have glorified my name! And I will glorify it through you again!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">The audible voice of God startled the crowd standing nearby. Some thought it was only thunder, yet others said, &amp;apos;An angel just spoke to him!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">Then Jesus told them, &amp;apos;The voice you heard was not for my benefit, but for yours&amp;ndash; to help you believe.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">From this moment on, everything in this world is about to change, for the ruler of this dark world will be overthrown.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">And I will do this when I am lifted up off the ground and when I draw the hearts of people to gather them to me.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">He said this to indicate that he would die by being lifted up on the cross.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">People from the crowd spoke up and said, &amp;apos;Die? How could the Anointed One die? The Word of God says that the Anointed One will live with us forever, but you just said that the Son of Man must be lifted up from the earth. And who is this Son of Man anyway?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">Jesus replied, &amp;apos;You will have the light shining with you for only a little while longer. While you still have me, walk in the light, so that the darkness doesn&amp;quot;t overtake you. For when you walk in the dark you have no idea where you&amp;quot;re going.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">So believe and cling to the light while I am with you, so that you will become children of light.&amp;apos; After saying this, Jesus then entered into the crowd and hid himself from them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">Even with the overwhelming evidence of all the many signs and wonders that Jesus had performed in front of them, his critics still refused to believe.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">This fulfilled the prophecy given by Isaiah: Lord, who has believed our message? Who has seen the unveiling of your great power?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">And the people were not able to believe, for Isaiah also prophesied:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">God has blinded their eyes and hardened their hearts to the truth. So with their eyes and hearts closed they cannot understand the truth nor turn to me so that I could instantly cleanse and heal them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">Isaiah said these things because he had seen and experienced the splendor of Jesus and prophesied about him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">Yet there were many Jewish leaders who believed in Jesus, but because they feared the Pharisees they kept it secret, so they wouldn&amp;quot;t be ostracized by the assembly of the Jews.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43">For they loved the glory that men could give them rather than the glory that came from God!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44">Jesus shouted out passionately, &amp;apos;To believe in me is to also believe in God who sent me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45">For when you look at me you are seeing the One who sent me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46">I have come as a light to shine in this dark world so that all who trust in me will no longer wander in darkness.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="47">If you hear my words and refuse to follow them, I do not judge you. For I have not come to judge you but to save you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="48">If you reject me and refuse to follow my words, you already have a judge. The message of truth I have given you will rise up to judge you at the Day of Judgment.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="49">For I&amp;quot;m not speaking as someone who is self-appointed, but I speak by the authority of the Father himself who sent me, and who instructed me what to say.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="50">And I know that the Father&amp;quot;s commands result in eternal life, and that&amp;quot;s why I speak the very words I&amp;quot;ve heard him speak.&amp;apos;</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="13">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Jesus knew that the night before Passover would be his last night on earth before leaving this world to return to the Father&amp;quot;s side. All throughout his time with his disciples, Jesus had demonstrated a deep and tender love for them. And now he longed to show them the full measure of his love.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Before their evening meal had begun, the accuser had already deeply embedded betrayal into the heart of Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Now Jesus was fully aware that the Father had placed all things under his control, for he had come from God and was about to go back to be with him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">So he got up from the meal and took off his outer robe, and took a towel and wrapped it around his waist.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Then he poured water into a basin and began to wash the disciples&amp;quot; dirty feet and dry them with his towel.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">But when Jesus got to Simon Peter, he objected and said, &amp;apos;I can&amp;quot;t let you wash my dirty feet&amp;ndash;you&amp;quot;re my Lord!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Jesus replied, &amp;apos;You don&amp;quot;t understand yet the meaning of what I&amp;quot;m doing, but soon it will be clear to you.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Peter looked at Jesus and said, &amp;apos;You&amp;quot;ll never wash my dirty feet&amp;ndash;never!&amp;apos; &amp;apos;But Peter, if you don&amp;quot;t allow me to wash your feet,&amp;apos; Jesus responded, &amp;apos;then you will not be able to share life with me.&amp;apos; Jesus replied, &amp;apos;Where I am going you won&amp;quot;t be able to follow, but one day you will follow me there.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">So Peter said, &amp;apos;Lord, in that case, don&amp;quot;t just wash my feet, wash my hands and my head too!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Jesus said to him, &amp;apos;You are already clean. You&amp;quot;ve been washed completely and you just need your feet to be cleansed&amp;ndash;but that can&amp;quot;t be said of all of you.&amp;apos; For Jesus knew which one was about to betray him,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">and that&amp;quot;s why he told them that not all of them were clean.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">After washing their feet, he put his robe on and returned to his place at the table. &amp;apos;Do you understand what I just did?&amp;apos; Jesus said.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">&amp;apos;You&amp;quot;ve called me your teacher and lord, and you&amp;quot;re right, for that&amp;quot;s who I am.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">I speak to you timeless truth: a servant is not superior to his master, and an apostle is never greater than the one who sent him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">So now put into practice what I have done for you, and you will experience a life of happiness enriched with untold blessings!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">&amp;apos;I don&amp;quot;t refer to all of you when I tell you these things, for I know the ones I&amp;quot;ve chosen&amp;ndash;to fulfill the Scripture that says, &amp;quot;The one who shared supper with me treacherously betrays me.&amp;quot;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">I am telling you this now, before it happens, so that when the prophecy comes to pass you will be convinced that I AM.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">&amp;apos;Listen to this timeless truth: whoever receives the messenger I send receives me, and the one who receives me receives the Father who sent me.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Then Jesus was moved deeply in his spirit. Looking at his disciples, he announced, &amp;apos;I tell you the truth&amp;ndash;one of you is about to betray me.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Eyeing each other, his disciples puzzled over which one of them could do such a thing.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">The disciple that Jesus dearly loved was at the right of him at the table and was leaning his head on Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">Peter gestured to this disciple to ask Jesus who it was he was referring to.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">Then the dearly loved disciple leaned into Jesus&amp;quot; chest and whispered, &amp;apos;Master, who is it?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">&amp;apos;The one I give this piece of bread to after I&amp;quot;ve dipped it in the bowl,&amp;apos; Jesus replied. Then he dipped the piece of bread into the bowl and handed it to Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">And when Judas ate the piece of bread, Satan entered him. Then Jesus looked at Judas and said, &amp;apos;What you are planning to do, go do it now.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">None of those around the table realized what was happening.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">Some thought that Judas, their trusted treasurer, was being told to go buy what was needed for the Passover celebration, or perhaps to go give something to the poor.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">So Judas left quickly and went out into the dark night to betray Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">After Judas left the room, Jesus said, &amp;apos;The time has come for the glory of God to surround the Son of Man, and God will be greatly glorified through what happens to me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">And very soon God will unveil the glory of the Son of Man.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">&amp;apos;My dear friends, I only have a brief time left to be with you. And then you will search and long for me. But I tell you what I told the Jewish leaders: you&amp;quot;ll not be able to come where I am.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">&amp;apos;So I give you now a new commandment: Love each other just as much as I have loved you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">For when you demonstrate the same love I have for you by loving one another, everyone will know that you&amp;quot;re my true followers.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">Peter interjected, &amp;apos;But, Master, where are you going?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">Peter said, &amp;apos;What do you mean I&amp;quot;m not able to follow you now? I would sacrifice my life to die for you!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">Jesus answered, &amp;apos;Would you really lay down your life for me, Peter? Here&amp;quot;s the absolute truth: Before the rooster crows in the morning, you will say three times that you don&amp;quot;t even know me!&amp;apos;</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1">&amp;apos;Don&amp;quot;t worry or surrender to your fear. For you&amp;quot;ve believed in God, now trust and believe in me also.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="3">And when everything is ready, I will come back and take you to myself so that you will be where I am.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">And you already know the way to the place where I&amp;quot;m going.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Thomas said to him, &amp;apos;Master, we don&amp;quot;t know where you&amp;quot;re going, so how could we know the way there?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Jesus explained, &amp;apos;I am the Way, I am the Truth, and I am the Life. No one comes next to the Father except through union with me. To know me is to know my Father too.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">And from now on you will realize that you have seen him and experienced him.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Philip spoke up, &amp;apos;Lord, show us the Father, and that will be all that we need!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Jesus replied, &amp;apos;Philip, I&amp;quot;ve been with you all this time and you still don&amp;quot;t know who I am? How could you ask me to show you the Father, for anyone who has looked at me has seen the Father.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Don&amp;quot;t you believe that the Father is living in me and that I am living in the Father? Even my words are not my own but come from my Father, for he lives in me and performs his miracles of power through me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Believe that I live as one with my Father and that my Father lives as one with me&amp;ndash;or at least, believe because of the mighty miracles I have done.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">&amp;apos;I tell you this timeless truth: The person who follows me in faith, believing in me, will do the same mighty miracles that I do&amp;ndash;even greater miracles than these because I go to be with my Father!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">For I will do whatever you ask me to do when you ask me in my name. And that is how the Son will show what the Father is really like and bring glory to him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Ask me anything in my name, and I will do it for you!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">&amp;apos;Loving me empowers you to obey my commands.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">&amp;apos;I promise that I will never leave you helpless or abandon you as orphans&amp;ndash;I will come back to you!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Soon I will leave this world and they will see me no longer, but you will see me, because I will live again, and you will come alive too.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="21">Those who truly love me are those who obey my commands. Whoever passionately loves me will be passionately loved by my Father. And I will passionately love him in return and will reveal myself to him.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Then one of the disciples named Judas (not Judas Iscariot) said, &amp;apos;Lord, why is it you will only reveal your identity to us and not to everyone?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">Jesus replied, &amp;apos;Loving me empowers you to obey my word. And my Father will love you so deeply that we will come to you and make you our dwelling place.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">But those who don&amp;quot;t love me will not obey my words. The Father did not send me to speak my own revelation, but the words of my Father.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">I am telling you this while I am still with you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">But when the Father sends the Spirit of Holiness, the One like me who sets you free, he will teach you all things in my name. And he will inspire you to remember every word that I&amp;quot;ve told you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">&amp;apos;I leave the gift of peace with you&amp;ndash;my peace. Not the kind of fragile peace given by the world, but my perfect peace. Don&amp;quot;t yield to fear or be troubled in your hearts&amp;ndash;instead, be courageous!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">&amp;apos;Remember what I&amp;quot;ve told you, that I must go away, but I promise to come back to you. So if you truly love me, you will be glad for me, since I&amp;quot;m returning to my Father, who is greater than I.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">So when all of these things happen, you will still trust and cling to me.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="3">The words I have spoken over you have already cleansed you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">So you must remain in life-union with me, for I remain in life-union with you. For as a branch severed from the vine will not bear fruit, so your life will be fruitless unless you live your life intimately joined to mine.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">&amp;apos;I am the sprouting vine and you&amp;quot;re my branches. As you live in union with me as your source, fruitfulness will stream from within you&amp;ndash;but when you live separated from me you are powerless.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="7">But here&amp;quot;s the truth: It&amp;quot;s to your advantage that I go away, for if I don&amp;quot;t go away the Divine Encourager will not be released to you. But after I depart, I will send him to you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">And when he comes, he will expose sin and prove that the world is wrong about God&amp;quot;s righteousness and his judgments.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">&amp;apos; &amp;quot;Sin,&amp;quot; because they refuse to believe in who I am.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">&amp;apos;God&amp;quot;s &amp;quot;righteousness,&amp;quot; because I&amp;quot;m going back to join the Father and you&amp;quot;ll see me no longer.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">&amp;apos;And &amp;quot;judgment&amp;quot; because the ruler of this dark world has already received his sentence.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">&amp;apos;There is so much more I would like to say to you, but it&amp;quot;s more than you can grasp at this moment.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">But when the truth-giving Spirit comes, he will unveil the reality of every truth within you. He won&amp;quot;t speak on his own, but only what he hears from the Father, and he will reveal prophetically to you what is to come.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">He will glorify me on the earth, for he will receive from me what is mine and reveal it to you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Everything that belongs to the Father belongs to me&amp;ndash;that&amp;quot;s why I say that the Divine Encourager will receive what is mine and reveal it to you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Soon you won&amp;quot;t see me any longer, but then, after a little while, you will see me in a new way .&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Some of the disciples asked each other, &amp;apos;What does he mean, &amp;quot;Soon you won&amp;quot;t see me,&amp;quot; and, &amp;quot;A little while after that and you will see me in a new way&amp;quot;? And what does he mean, &amp;quot;Because I&amp;quot;m going to my Father&amp;quot;?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">So they kept on repeating, &amp;apos;What&amp;quot;s the meaning of &amp;quot;a little while&amp;quot;? We have no clue what he&amp;quot;s talking about!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Jesus knew what they were thinking, and it was obvious that they were anxious to ask him what he had meant, so he spoke up and said,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">&amp;apos;Let me make it quite clear: You will weep and be overcome with grief over what happens to me . The unbelieving world will be happy, while you will be filled with sorrow. But know this, your sadness will turn into joy when you see me again!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Just like a woman giving birth experiences intense labor pains in delivering her baby, yet after the child is born she quickly forgets what she went through because of the overwhelming joy of knowing that a new baby has been born into the world.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">&amp;apos;So will you also pass through a time of intense sorrow when I am taken from you , but you will see me again! And then your hearts will burst with joy, with no one being able to take it from you!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">For here is eternal truth: When that time comes you won&amp;quot;t need to ask me for anything, but instead you will go directly to the Father and ask him for anything you desire and he will give it to you, because of your relationship with me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">Until now you&amp;quot;ve not been bold enough to ask the Father for a single thing in my name, but now you can ask, and keep on asking him! And you can be sure that you&amp;quot;ll receive what you ask for, and your joy will have no limits!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">&amp;apos;I have spoken to you using figurative language, but the time is coming when I will no longer teach you with veiled speech, but I will teach you about the Father with your eyes unveiled.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">And I will not need to ask the Father on your behalf, for you&amp;quot;ll ask him directly because of your new relationship with me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">For the Father tenderly loves you, because you love me and believe that I&amp;quot;ve come from God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">I came to you sent from the Father&amp;quot;s presence, and I entered into the created world, and now I will leave this world and return to the Father&amp;quot;s side.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">His disciples said, &amp;apos;At last you&amp;quot;re speaking to us clearly and not using veiled speech and metaphors!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">Now we understand that you know everything there is to know, and we don&amp;quot;t need to question you further. And everything you&amp;quot;ve taught us convinces us that you have come directly from God!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">Jesus replied, &amp;apos;Now you finally believe in me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">And the time has come when you will all be scattered, and each one of you will go your own way, leaving me alone! Yet I am never alone, for the Father is always with me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">And everything I&amp;quot;ve taught you is so that the peace which is in me will be in you and will give you great confidence as you rest in me. For in this unbelieving world you will experience trouble and sorrows, but you must be courageous, for I have conquered the world!&amp;apos;</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1">This is what Jesus prayed as he looked up into heaven, &amp;apos;Father, the time has come. so that I will magnify your glory! over all people so that I may give the gift of eternal life to all those that you have given to me. and to know and experience Jesus Christ, as the Son whom you have sent. by faithfully doing everything you&amp;quot;ve told me to do. that we shared together when we were face-to-face They were yours, and you gave them to me, and they have fastened your Word firmly to their hearts. I have passed on to them. They have received your words and carry them in their hearts. They are convinced that I have come from your presence, and they have fully believed that you sent me to represent you. but for those who belong to you, those you have given me. And all who belong to you now belong to me as well, to return and be with you, but my disciples will remain here. Holy Father, each one that you have given me, keep them in your name so that they will be united as one, even as we are one. I was guarding them and keeping them in your name. Not one of them is lost, so that the Scripture would be fulfilled. so that it is fulfilled in them and overflows. and that is why the unbelieving world hates them. For their allegiance is no longer to this world because I am not of this world. just as you commissioned me to represent you. so that they will live as fully dedicated to God but also for all those who will one day believe in me through their message. even as you and I, Father, are joined together as one. so that the world will recognize that you sent me. so that they will be joined together as one and the world will be convinced that you have sent me, for they will see that you love each one of them with the same passionate love that you have for me. Then they will see my full glory&amp;ndash; the very splendor you have placed upon me because you have loved me even before the beginning of time. but the unbelieving world has never known you in the perfect way that I know you! also know that you have sent me! and I will continue to make you even more real to them, so that they may experience the same endless love that you have for me, for your love will now live in them, even as I live in them!&amp;apos; Unveil the glorious splendor of your Son as the only true God, before the universe was created.&amp;apos; and I have revealed you to the men and women that you gave to me. I&amp;quot;m not asking on behalf of the unbelieving world, and my glory is revealed through their surrendered lives. except the one that was destined to be lost, I pray that they will experience and enter into my joyous delight in you but I ask that you guard their hearts from evil, and be made holy by your truth.&amp;apos; I pray for them to become one with us and experience the same unity that we enjoy. so that they will experience perfect unity, to be with me where I am!

		<CHAPTER cnumber="18">
			<VERS vnumber="1">After Jesus finished this prayer; he left with his disciples and went across the Kidron Valley to a place where there was a garden.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Judas, the traitor, knew where this place was, for Jesus had gone there often with his disciples.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">The Pharisees and the leading priests had given Judas a large detachment of Roman soldiers and temple police to seize Jesus. Judas guided them to the garden, all of them carrying torches and lanterns and armed with swords and spears .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Jesus, knowing full well what was about to happen, went out to the garden entrance to meet them. Stepping forward, he asked, &amp;apos;Who are you looking for?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">&amp;apos;Jesus of Nazareth,&amp;apos; they replied. (Now Judas, the traitor, was among them.) He replied, &amp;apos;I am he.&amp;apos; As they stood up, they answered, &amp;apos;Jesus of Nazareth.&amp;apos; He denied it, saying, &amp;apos;No! I&amp;quot;m not!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">And the moment Jesus spoke the words, &amp;apos;I am he,&amp;apos; the mob fell backward to the ground!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">So once more, Jesus asked them, &amp;apos;Who are you looking for?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Jesus replied, &amp;apos;I told you that I am the one you&amp;quot;re looking for, so if you want me, let these men go home.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">He said this to fulfill the prophecy he had spoken, &amp;apos;Father, not one of those you have given me has been lost.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Suddenly, Peter took out his sword and struck the high priest&amp;quot;s servant, slashing off his right ear! The servant&amp;quot;s name was Malchus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Jesus ordered Peter, &amp;apos;Put your sword away! Do you really think I will avoid the suffering which my Father has assigned to me?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Then the soldiers and their captain, along with the Jewish officers, seized Jesus and tied him up.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">They took him first to Annas, as he was the father-in-law of Caiaphas, the high priest that year.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Caiaphas was the one who had persuaded the Jewish leaders that it would be better off to have one person die for the sake of the people.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Peter and another disciple followed along behind them as they took Jesus into the courtyard of Annas&amp;quot; palace. Since the other disciple was well known to the high priest, he entered in,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">but Peter was left standing outside by the gate. Then the other disciple came back out to the servant girl who was guarding the gate and convinced her to allow Peter inside.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">As he passed inside, the young servant girl guarding the gate took a look at Peter and said to him, &amp;apos;Aren&amp;quot;t you one of his disciples?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Now because it was cold, the soldiers and guards made a charcoal fire and were standing around it to keep warm. So Peter huddled there with them around the fire.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">The high priest interrogated Jesus concerning his disciples and his teachings.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Jesus answered Annas&amp;quot; questions by saying, &amp;apos;I have said nothing in secret. At all times I have taught openly and publicly in a synagogue, in the temple courts, and wherever the people assemble.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Why would you ask me for evidence to condemn me? Ask those who have heard what I&amp;quot;ve taught. They can tell you.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Just then one of the guards standing near Jesus punched him in the face with his fist and said, &amp;apos;How dare you answer the high priest like that!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">Jesus replied, &amp;apos;If my words are evil, then prove it. But if I haven&amp;quot;t broken any laws, then why would you hit me?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">Then Annas sent Jesus, still tied up, across the way to the high priest Caiaphas.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">Meanwhile, Peter was still standing in the courtyard by the fire. And one of the guards standing there said to him, &amp;apos;Aren&amp;quot;t you one of his disciples? I know you are!&amp;apos; Peter swore and said, &amp;apos;I am not his disciple!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">But one of the servants of the high priest, a relative to the man whose ear Peter had cut off, looked at him and said, &amp;apos;Wait! Didn&amp;quot;t I see you out there in the garden with Jesus?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">Then Peter denied it the third time and said, &amp;apos;No!&amp;apos;&amp;ndash;and at that very same moment, a rooster crowed nearby.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">Before dawn they took Jesus from his trial before Caiaphas to the Roman governor&amp;quot;s palace. Now the Jews refused to go into the Roman governor&amp;quot;s residence to avoid ceremonial defilement before eating the Passover meal.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">So Pilate came outside where they waited and asked them pointedly, &amp;apos;Tell me, what exactly is the accusation that you bring against this man? What has he done?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">They answered, &amp;apos;We wouldn&amp;quot;t be coming here to hand over this &amp;quot;criminal&amp;quot; to you if he wasn&amp;quot;t guilty of some wrongdoing!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">Pilate said, &amp;apos;Very well, then you take him yourselves and go pass judgment on him according to your Jewish laws!&amp;apos; But the Jewish leaders complained and said, &amp;apos;We don&amp;quot;t have legal authority to put anyone to death. You should have him crucified !&amp;apos; &amp;apos;You are right.&amp;apos; Jesus said, &amp;apos;I was born a King, and I have come into this world to prove what truth really is. And everyone who loves the truth will receive my words.&amp;apos; As silence filled the room, Pilate went back out to where the Jewish leaders were waiting and said to them, &amp;apos;He&amp;quot;s not guilty. I couldn&amp;quot;t even find one fault with him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">(This was to fulfill the words of Jesus when he predicted the manner of death that he would die.)</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">Upon hearing this, Pilate went back inside his palace and summoned Jesus. Looking him over, Pilate asked him, &amp;apos;Are you really the king of the Jews?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">Jesus replied, &amp;apos;Are you asking because you really want to know, or are you only asking this because others have said it about me?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">Pilate responded, &amp;apos;Only a Jew would care about this; do I look like a Jew? It&amp;quot;s your own people and your religious leaders that have handed you over to me. So tell me, Jesus, what have you done wrong?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">Jesus looked at Pilate and said, &amp;apos;The royal power of my kingdom realm doesn&amp;quot;t come from this world. If it did, then my followers would be fighting to the end to defend me from the Jewish leaders. My kingdom realm authority is not from this realm.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">Then Pilate responded, &amp;apos;Oh, so then you are a king?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">Pilate looked at Jesus and said, &amp;apos;What is truth?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">Now, you do know that we have a custom that I release one prisoner every year at Passover&amp;ndash;shall I release your king&amp;ndash;the king of the Jews?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">They shouted out over and over, &amp;apos;No, not him! Give us Barabbas!&amp;apos; (Now Barabbas was a robber and a troublemaker.)</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="19">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Then Pilate ordered Jesus to be brutally beaten with a whip of leather straps embedded with metal.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">And the soldiers also wove thorn-branches into a crown and set it on his head and placed a purple robe over his shoulders.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Then, one by one, they came in front of him to mock him by saying, &amp;apos;Hail, to the king of the Jews!&amp;apos; And one after the other, they repeatedly punched him in the face.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Once more Pilate went out and said to the Jewish officials, &amp;apos;I will bring him out once more so that you know that I&amp;quot;ve found nothing wrong with him.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">So when Jesus emerged, bleeding , wearing the purple robe and the crown of thorns on his head, Pilate said to them, &amp;apos;Look at him! Here is your man!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">No sooner did the high priests and the temple guards see Jesus that they all shouted in a frenzy, &amp;apos;Crucify him! Crucify him!&amp;apos; Pilate replied, &amp;apos;You take him then and nail him to a cross yourselves! I told you&amp;ndash;he&amp;quot;s not guilty! I find no reason to condemn him.&amp;apos; Then Pilate said to the Jewish officials, &amp;apos;Look! Here is your king!&amp;apos; Pilate replied, &amp;apos;Shall I nail your king to a cross?&amp;apos; The high priests answered, &amp;apos;We have no other king but Caesar!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">The Jewish leaders shouted back, &amp;apos;But we have the Law! And according to our Law, he must die, because he claimed to be the Son of God!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Then Pilate was greatly alarmed when he heard that Jesus claimed to be the Son of God!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">So he took Jesus back inside and said to him, &amp;apos;Where have you come from?&amp;apos; But once again, silence filled the room.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Perplexed, Pilate said, &amp;apos;Are you going to play deaf? Don&amp;quot;t you know that I have the power to grant you your freedom or nail you to a tree?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Jesus answered, &amp;apos;You would have no power over me at all, unless it was given to you from above. This is why the one who betrayed me is guilty of an even greater sin.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">From then on Pilate tried to find a way out of the situation and to set him free, but the Jewish authorities shouted him down: &amp;apos;If you let this man go, you&amp;quot;re no friend of Caesar! Anyone who declares himself a king is an enemy of the emperor!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">So when Pilate heard this threat, he relented and had Jesus, who was torn and bleeding , brought outside. Then he went up the elevated stone platform and took his seat on the judgment bench&amp;ndash;which in Aramaic is called Gabbatha, or &amp;apos;The Bench.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">And it was now almost noon. And it was the same day they were preparing to slay the Passover lambs.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">But they screamed out, &amp;apos;Take him away! Take him away and crucify him!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Then Pilate handed Jesus over to them. So the soldiers seized him and took him away to be crucified.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Jesus carried his own cross out of the city to the place called &amp;apos;The Skull,&amp;apos; which in Aramaic is Golgotha.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">And there they nailed him to the cross. He was crucified, along with two others, one on each side with Jesus in the middle.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">But the chief priests of the Jews said to Pilate, &amp;apos;You must change the sign! Don&amp;quot;t let it say, &amp;quot;King of the Jews,&amp;quot; but rather&amp;ndash;&amp;quot;he claimed to be the King of the Jews!&amp;quot; &amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Pilate responded, &amp;apos;What I have written will remain!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">Now when the soldiers crucified Jesus, they divided up his clothes into four shares, one for each of them. But his tunic was seamless, woven from the top to the bottom as a single garment.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">So the soldiers said to each other, &amp;apos;Don&amp;quot;t tear it&amp;ndash;let&amp;quot;s throw dice to see who gets it!&amp;apos; The soldiers did all of this not knowing they fulfilled the Scripture that says, &amp;apos;They divided my garments among them and gambled for my clothing.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">Mary, Jesus&amp;quot; mother, was standing next to his cross, along with Mary&amp;quot;s sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">So when Jesus looked down and saw the disciple he loved standing with her, he said, &amp;apos;Mother, look&amp;ndash;John will be a son to you.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">Then he said, &amp;apos; John, look&amp;ndash;she will be a mother to you!&amp;apos; From that day on, John accepted Mary into his home as one of his own family .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">Jesus knew that his mission was accomplished, and to fulfill the Scripture, Jesus said: &amp;apos;I am thirsty.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">A jar of sour wine was sitting nearby, so they soaked a sponge with it and put it on the stalk of hyssop and raised it to his lips.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">When he had sipped the sour wine, he said, &amp;apos;It is finished, my bride!&amp;apos; Then he bowed his head and surrendered his spirit to God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">The Jewish leaders did not want the bodies of the victims to remain on the cross through the next day, since it was the day of preparation for a very important Sabbath. So they asked Pilate&amp;quot;s permission to have the victims&amp;quot; legs broken to hasten their death and their bodies taken down before sunset.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">So the soldiers broke the legs of the two men who were nailed there.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">But when they came to Jesus, they realized that he had already died, so they decided not to break his legs.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">But one of the soldiers took a spear and pierced Jesus&amp;quot; side, and blood and water gushed out.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">(I, John, do testify to the certainty of what took place, and I write the truth so that you might also believe.)</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">For all these things happened to fulfill the prophecies of the Scriptures: &amp;apos;Not one of his bones will be broken,&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">and, &amp;apos;They will gaze on the one they have pierced!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">After this, Joseph from the city of Ramah, who was a secret disciple of Jesus for fear of the Jewish authorities, asked Pilate if he could remove the body of Jesus. So Pilate granted him permission to remove the body from the cross.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">Now Nicodemus, who had once come to Jesus privately at night, accompanied Joseph, and together they carried a significant amount of myrrh and aloes to the cross.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">Then they took Jesus&amp;quot; body and wrapped it in strips of linen with the embalming spices according to the Jewish burial customs.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">Near the place where Jesus was crucified was a garden, and in the garden there was a new tomb where no one had yet been laid to rest.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">And because the Sabbath was approaching, and the tomb was nearby, that&amp;quot;s where they laid the body of Jesus.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="20">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Very early Sunday morning, before sunrise, Mary Magdalene made her way to the tomb. And when she arrived she discovered that the stone that sealed the entrance to the tomb was moved away!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">So she went running as fast as she could to go tell Peter and the other disciple, the one Jesus loved. She told them, &amp;apos;They&amp;quot;ve taken the Lord&amp;quot;s body from the tomb, and we don&amp;quot;t know where he is!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Then Peter and the other disciple jumped up and ran to the tomb to go see for themselves.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">They started out together, but the other disciple outran Peter and reached the tomb first.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">He didn&amp;quot;t enter the tomb, but peeked in, and saw only the linen cloths lying there.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Then Peter came behind him and went right into the tomb. He too noticed the linen cloths lying there,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">but the burial cloth that had been on Jesus&amp;quot; head had been rolled up and placed separate from the other cloths.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Then the other disciple who had reached the tomb first went in, and after one look, he believed!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">For until then they hadn&amp;quot;t understood the Scriptures that prophesied that he was destined to rise from the dead.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Puzzled, Peter and the other disciple then left and went back to their homes.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Mary arrived back at the tomb , broken and sobbing. She stooped to peer inside, and through her tears</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">she saw two angels in dazzling white robes, sitting where Jesus&amp;quot; body had been laid&amp;ndash;one at the head and one at the feet!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">&amp;apos;Dear woman, why are you crying?&amp;apos; they asked. Mary answered, &amp;apos;They have taken away my Lord, and I don&amp;quot;t know where they&amp;quot;ve laid him.&amp;apos; Mary answered, thinking he was only the gardener, &amp;apos;Sir, if you have taken his body somewhere else, tell me, and I will go and . . .&amp;apos; Turning to face him, she said, &amp;apos;Rabboni!&amp;apos; (Aramaic for &amp;apos;My teacher!&amp;apos;)</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Then she turned around to leave, and there was Jesus standing in front of her, but she didn&amp;quot;t realize that it was him!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">He said to her, &amp;apos;Dear woman, why are you crying? Who are you looking for?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">&amp;apos;Mary,&amp;apos; Jesus interrupted her.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Jesus cautioned her, &amp;apos;Mary, don&amp;quot;t cling to me, for I haven&amp;quot;t yet ascended to God, my Father. And he&amp;quot;s not only my Father and God, but now he&amp;quot;s your Father and your God! Now go to my brothers and tell them what I&amp;quot;ve told you, that I am ascending to my Father&amp;ndash;and your Father, to my God&amp;ndash;and your God!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Then Mary Magdalene left to inform the disciples of her encounter with Jesus. &amp;apos;I have seen the Lord!&amp;apos; she told them. And she gave them his message.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">That evening, the disciples gathered together, and because they were afraid of reprisals from the Jewish leaders, they had locked the doors. But suddenly Jesus appeared among them and said, &amp;apos;Peace to you!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Then he showed them the wounds of his hands and his side&amp;ndash;they were overjoyed to see the Lord with their own eyes!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Jesus repeated his greeting, &amp;apos;Peace to you!&amp;apos; And he told them, &amp;apos;Just as the Father has sent me, I&amp;quot;m now sending you.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Then, taking a deep breath, he blew on them and said, &amp;apos;Receive the Holy Spirit.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">I send you to preach the forgiveness of sins&amp;ndash;and people&amp;quot;s sins will be forgiven. But if you don&amp;quot;t proclaim the forgiveness of their sins, they will remain guilty.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">One of the twelve wasn&amp;quot;t present when Jesus appeared to them&amp;ndash;it was Thomas, whose nickname was &amp;apos;the Twin.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">So the disciples informed him, &amp;apos;We have seen the Lord with our own eyes!&amp;apos; Still unconvinced, Thomas replied, &amp;apos;There&amp;quot;s no way I&amp;quot;m going to believe this unless I personally see the wounds of the nails in his hands, touch them with my finger, and put my hand into the wound of his side where he was pierced!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">Then eight days later, Thomas and all the others were in the house together. And even though all the doors were locked, Jesus suddenly stood before them! &amp;apos;Peace to you,&amp;apos; he said.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">Then, looking into Thomas&amp;quot; eyes, he said, &amp;apos;Put your finger here in the wounds of my hands. Here&amp;ndash;put your hand into my wounded side and see for yourself. Thomas, don&amp;quot;t give in to your doubts any longer, just believe!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">Then the words spilled out of his heart&amp;ndash;&amp;apos;You are my Lord, and you are my God!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">Jesus responded, &amp;apos;Thomas, now that you&amp;quot;ve seen me, you believe. But there are those who have never seen me with their eyes but have believed in me with their hearts, and they will be blessed even more!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">Jesus went on to do many more miraculous signs in the presence of his disciples, which are not even included in this book.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">But all that is recorded here is so that you will fully believe that Jesus is the Anointed One, the Son of God, and that through your faith in him you will experience eternal life by the power of his name!</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="21">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Later, Jesus appeared once again to a group of his disciples by Lake Galilee.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">It happened one day while Peter, Thomas (the Twin), Nathanael (from Cana in Galilee), Jacob, John, and two other disciples were all together.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Peter told them, &amp;apos;I&amp;quot;m going fishing.&amp;apos; And they all replied, &amp;apos;We&amp;quot;ll go with you.&amp;apos; So they went out and fished through the night, but caught nothing.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Then at dawn, Jesus was standing there on the shore, but the disciples didn&amp;quot;t realize that it was him!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">He called out to them, saying, &amp;apos;Hey guys! Did you catch any fish?&amp;apos; &amp;apos;Not a thing,&amp;apos; they replied. And not one of the disciples needed to ask who it was, because every one of them knew it was the Lord. Peter answered, &amp;apos;Yes, Lord! You know that I have great affection for you!&amp;apos; Peter answered, &amp;apos;Yes, my Lord! You know that I have great affection for you!&amp;apos; &amp;apos;Then take care of my sheep,&amp;apos; Jesus said. Jesus replied, &amp;apos;Then feed my lambs!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Jesus shouted to them, &amp;apos;Throw your net over the starboard side, and you&amp;quot;ll catch some!&amp;apos; And so they did as he said, and they caught so many fish they couldn&amp;quot;t even pull in the net!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Then the disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter, &amp;apos;It&amp;quot;s the Lord!&amp;apos; When Peter heard him say that, he quickly wrapped his outer garment around him, and because he was athletic, he dove right into the lake to go to Jesus!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">The other disciples then brought the boat to shore, dragging their catch of fish. They weren&amp;quot;t far from land, only about a hundred meters.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">And when they got to shore, they noticed a charcoal fire with some roasted fish and bread.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Then Jesus said, &amp;apos;Bring some of the fish you just caught.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">So Peter waded into the water and helped pull the net to shore. It was full of many large fish, exactly one hundred and fifty-three, but even with so many fish, the net was not torn.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">&amp;apos;Come, let&amp;quot;s have some breakfast,&amp;apos; Jesus said to them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Then Jesus came close to them and served them the bread and the fish.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">This was the third time Jesus appeared to his disciples after his resurrection.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">After they had breakfast, Jesus said to Peter, &amp;apos;Simon, son of Jonah, do you burn with love for me more than these?&amp;apos; &amp;apos;Then take care of my lambs,&amp;apos; Jesus said. Peter was saddened by being asked the third time and said, &amp;apos;My Lord, you know everything. You know that I burn with love for you!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Jesus repeated his question the second time, &amp;apos;Simon, son of Jonah, do you burn with love for me?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Then Jesus asked him again, &amp;apos;Peter, son of Jonah, do you have great affection for me?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Peter, listen, when you were younger you made your own choices and you went where you pleased. But one day when you are old, others will tie you up and escort you where you would not choose to go&amp;ndash;and you will spread out your arms.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">(Jesus said this to Peter as a prophecy of what kind of death he would die, for the glory of God.) And then he said, &amp;apos;Peter, follow me!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Then Peter turned and saw that the disciple whom Jesus loved was following them. (This was the disciple who sat close to Jesus at the Last Supper and had asked him, &amp;apos;Lord, who is the one that will betray you?&amp;apos;)</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">So when Peter saw him, he asked Jesus, &amp;apos;What&amp;quot;s going to happen to him?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Jesus replied, &amp;apos;If I decide to let him live until I return, what concern is that of yours? You must still keep on following me!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">So the rumor started to circulate among the believers that this disciple wasn&amp;quot;t going to die. But Jesus never said that, he only said, &amp;apos;If I let him live until I return, what concern is that of yours?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">I, John, am that disciple who has written these things to testify of the truth, and we know that what I&amp;quot;ve documented is accurate.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">Jesus did countless things that I haven&amp;quot;t included here. And if every one of his works were written down and described one by one , I suppose that the world itself wouldn&amp;quot;t have enough room to contain the books that would have to be written!</VERS>

	</BIBLEBOOK>
	<BIBLEBOOK bnumber="44" bname="Acts">
		<CHAPTER cnumber="1">
			<VERS vnumber="1">To Theophilus, the lover of God. I write to you again, my dear friend, to give you further details about the life of our Lord Jesus and all the things that he did and taught. No one will live there.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Let another take his ministry.&amp;quot;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Just before he ascended into heaven, Jesus left instructions through the Holy Spirit for the apostles he had chosen.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">After the sufferings of his cross, Jesus appeared alive many times to these same apostles over a forty-day period, proving to them with many convincing signs that he had been resurrected. During these encounters, he taught them the truths of God&amp;quot;s kingdom.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Jesus instructed them, &amp;apos;Don&amp;quot;t leave Jerusalem, but wait here until you receive the gift I told you about, the gift the Father has promised.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">For John baptized you in water, but in a few days from now you will be baptized in the Holy Spirit!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Every time they were gathered together, they asked Jesus, &amp;apos;Lord, is it now the time for you to free Israel and restore our kingdom?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">He answered, &amp;apos;The Father is the one who sets the fixed dates and the times of their fulfillment. You are not permitted to know the timing of all that he has prepared by his own authority.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">But I promise you this&amp;ndash;the Holy Spirit will come upon you, and you will be seized with power. You will be my messengers to Jerusalem, throughout Judea, the distant provinces &amp;ndash;even to the remotest places on earth!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Right after Jesus spoke those words, the disciples saw him being lifted into the sky, and disappearing into a cloud!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">As they stared into the sky, watching Jesus ascend, two men in white robes suddenly appeared beside them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">They told the startled disciples, &amp;apos;Galileans, why are you staring up into the sky? Jesus has been taken from you into heaven, but he will come back in the same way that you saw him ascend.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">The disciples left the Mount of Olives and returned to Jerusalem, which was less than a mile away.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">During this time Peter stood up among the 120 believers who were gathered and said,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">&amp;apos;Fellow believers, the Scripture David prophesied by the Holy Spirit concerning Judas had to be fulfilled. Judas betrayed our Lord Jesus and led the mob to the garden to arrest him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">He was one of us, and he was chosen to be an apostle just as we were.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">He earned the wages of his sin, for he fell headfirst, and his belly split open, spilling his intestines on the ground.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Everyone in Jerusalem knows what happened to him. That&amp;quot;s why the field where he died is called in Aramaic &amp;quot;Haqel Dama,&amp;quot; that is, &amp;quot;The Bloody Field.&amp;quot;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">For it is written in the Psalms: &amp;quot;Let his house be deserted and become a wasteland. And also:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">&amp;apos;So then, we must choose his replacement from among those who have been with us from the very beginning,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">from John&amp;quot;s baptism until Jesus&amp;quot; ascension. And, like us, he must be a witness of his resurrection.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">They proposed two candidates: Joseph, who is also called Barsabbas the Just, and Matthias.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">They all prayed, &amp;apos;Lord Yahweh , you know the heart of every man. Please give us clear revelation to know which of these two men you have chosen</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">to be an apostle and take Judas&amp;quot; place because he renounced his apostleship to go where he belonged.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">They cast lots and determined that Matthias was the Lord&amp;quot;s choice, so he was added to the eleven apostles.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="2">
			<VERS vnumber="1">On the day Pentecost was being fulfilled, all the disciples were gathered in one place.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Suddenly they heard the sound of a violent blast of wind rushing into the house from out of the heavenly realm. The roar of the wind was so overpowering it was all anyone could bear!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Then all at once a pillar of fire appeared before their eyes . It separated into tongues of fire that engulfed each one of them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">They were all filled and equipped with the Holy Spirit and were inspired to speak in tongues&amp;ndash;empowered by the Spirit to speak in languages they had never learned!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Now, at that time there were Jewish worshipers who had emigrated from many different lands to live in Jerusalem.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">When the people of the city heard the roaring sound, crowds came running to where it was coming from, stunned over what was happening, because each one could hear the disciples speaking in his or her own language.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Bewildered, they said to one another, &amp;apos;Aren&amp;quot;t these all Galileans?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">So how is it that we hear them speaking in our own languages?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">We are northeastern Iranians, northwestern Iranians, Elamites, and those from Mesopotamia, Judea, east central Turkey, the coastal areas of the Black Sea, Asia,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">north central Turkey, southern Turkey, Egypt, Libyans who are neighbors of Cyrene, visitors from all over the Roman Empire, both Jews and converts to Judaism, Cretans and Arabs.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Yet we hear them speaking of God&amp;quot;s mighty wonders in our own dialects!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">They all stood there, dumbfounded and astonished, saying to one another, &amp;apos;What is this phenomenon?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">But others poked fun at them and said, &amp;apos;They&amp;quot;re just drunk on new wine.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Peter stood up with the eleven apostles and shouted to the crowd. &amp;apos;Listen carefully, my fellow Jews and residents of Jerusalem. You need to clearly understand what&amp;quot;s happening here.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">These people are not drunk like you think they are, for it is only nine o&amp;quot;clock in the morning.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">This is the fulfillment of what was prophesied through the prophet Joel, for God says :</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">&amp;quot;This is what I will do in the last days &amp;ndash;I will pour out my Spirit on everybody and cause your sons and daughters to prophesy, and your young men will see visions, and your old men will experience dreams from God .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">The Holy Spirit will come upon all my servants, men and women alike, and they will prophesy.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">I will reveal startling signs and wonders in the sky above and mighty miracles on the earth below. Blood and fire and pillars of clouds will appear.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">For the sun will be turned dark and the moon blood-red before that great and awesome appearance of the day of the Lord.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">But everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.&amp;quot; &amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Peter continued, &amp;apos;People of Israel, listen to the facts. Jesus, the Victorious, was a man on a divine mission whose authority was clearly proven. For you know how God performed many powerful miracles, signs, and wonders through him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">This Man&amp;quot;s destiny was prearranged, for God knew that Jesus would be handed over to you to be crucified and that you would execute him on a cross by the hands of lawless men. Yet it was all part of his predetermined plan.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">God destroyed the cords of death and raised him up, because it was impossible for death&amp;quot;s power to hold him prisoner.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">This is the very thing David prophesied about him: &amp;quot;I continually see the Lord in front of me. He&amp;quot;s at my right hand, and I am never shaken. and I have hope that my body will live and seeing your face fills me with euphoria!&amp;quot; &amp;quot; Yahweh said to my Lord, I honor you by enthroning you beside me, a footstool beneath your feet.&amp;quot;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">No wonder my heart is glad and my glory celebrates! My mouth is filled with his praises, nor will you allow your sacred one to experience decay.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">because you will not leave my soul among the dead,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">For you have revealed to me the pathways to life,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">&amp;apos;My fellow Jews, I can tell you there is no doubt that our noted patriarch has both died and been buried in his tomb, which remains to this day. So you can see that he was not referring to himself with those words .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">But as a prophet, he knew God&amp;quot;s faithful promise, made with God&amp;quot;s unbreakable oath, that one of his descendants would take his throne.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">So when peering into the future, David prophesied of the Messiah&amp;quot;s resurrection. And God revealed to him that the Messiah would not be abandoned to the realm of death, nor would his body experience decay.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">&amp;apos;Can&amp;quot;t you see it? God has resurrected Jesus, and we all have seen him!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">&amp;apos;Then God exalted him to his right hand upon the throne of highest honor. And the Father gave him the authority to send the promised Holy Spirit, which is being poured out upon us today. This is what you&amp;quot;re seeing and hearing!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">&amp;apos;David wasn&amp;quot;t the one who ascended into heaven, but the one who prophesied:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">until I make your enemies</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">&amp;apos;Now everyone in Israel can know for certain that Jesus, whom you crucified, is the one God has made both Lord and the Messiah.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">When they heard this they were crushed and realized what they had done to Jesus. Deeply moved, they said to Peter and the other apostles, &amp;apos;What do we need to do, brothers?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">Peter replied, &amp;apos;Repent and return to God, and each one of you must be baptized in the name of Jesus, the Anointed One, to have your sins removed. Then you may take hold of the gift of the Holy Spirit.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">For God&amp;quot;s promise of the Holy Spirit is for you and your families, for those yet to be born and for everyone whom the Lord our God calls to himself.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">Peter preached to them and warned them with these words: &amp;apos;Be rescued from the wayward and perverse culture of this world!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">Those who believed the word that day numbered three thousand. They were all baptized and added to the church .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">Every believer was faithfully devoted to following the teachings of the apostles. Their hearts were mutually linked to one another, sharing communion and coming together regularly for prayer.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43">A deep sense of holy awe swept over everyone, and the apostles performed many miraculous signs and wonders.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44">All the believers were in fellowship as one body, and they shared with one another whatever they had.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45">Out of generosity they even sold their assets to distribute the proceeds to those who were in need among them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46">Daily they met together in the temple courts and in one another&amp;quot;s homes to celebrate communion. They shared meals together with joyful hearts and tender humility.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="47">They were continually filled with praises to God, enjoying the favor of all the people. And the Lord kept adding to their number daily those who were coming to life.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="3">
			<VERS vnumber="1">One afternoon Peter and John went to the temple for the three o&amp;quot;clock prayer.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">As they came to the entrance called the Beautiful Gate, they were captured by the sight of a man crippled from birth being carried and placed at the entrance to the temple. He was often brought there to beg for money from those going in to worship.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">When he noticed Peter and John going into the temple, he begged them for money.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Peter and John, looking straight into the eyes of the crippled man, said, &amp;apos;Look at us!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Expecting a gift, he readily gave them his attention.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Then Peter said, &amp;apos;I don&amp;quot;t have money, but I&amp;quot;ll give you this&amp;ndash;by the power of the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, stand up and walk!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">When all the people saw him jumping up and down and heard him glorifying God,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">they realized it was the crippled beggar they had passed by in front of the Beautiful Gate. Astonishment swept over the crowd, for they were amazed over what had happened to him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Dumbfounded over what they were witnessing, the crowd ran over to Peter and John, who were standing under the covered walkway called Solomon&amp;quot;s Porch. Standing there also was the healed beggar, clinging to Peter and John.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">With the crowd surrounding him, Peter said to them all, &amp;apos;People of Israel, listen to me! Why are you so amazed by this healing? Why do you stare at us? We didn&amp;quot;t make this crippled man walk by our own power or authority.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">The God of our ancestors, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, has done this . For he has glorified his Servant Jesus, the one you denied to Pilate&amp;quot;s face when he decided to release him&amp;ndash;and you insisted that he be crucified.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">You rejected the one who is holy and righteous, and instead begged for a murderer to be released.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">You killed the Prince of Life! But God raised him from the dead, and we stand here as witnesses to that fact.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Faith in Jesus&amp;quot; name has healed this man standing before you. It is the faith that comes through believing in Jesus&amp;quot; name that has made the crippled man walk right in front of your eyes!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">&amp;apos;My fellow Jews, I realize that neither you nor your leaders realize the grave mistake you made.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">But in spite of what you&amp;quot;ve done, God has fulfilled what he foretold through the prophets long ago about the sufferings of his Anointed One.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">And now you must repent and turn back to God so that your sins will be removed, and so that times of refreshing will stream from the Lord&amp;quot;s presence.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">And he will send you Jesus, the Messiah, the appointed one.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">For he must remain in heaven until the restoration of all things has taken place, fulfilling everything that God said long ago through his holy prophets.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">For has not Moses told us: &amp;quot;The Lord your God will raise up a prophet from among you who is like me. Listen to him and follow everything he tells you. will be cut off and completely destroyed.&amp;quot;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">Every person who disobeys that prophet</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">&amp;apos;In fact, every prophet from the time of Samuel onward has prophesied of these very days!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">And you are heirs of their prophecies and of the covenants God made with your fathers when he promised Abraham, &amp;quot;Your descendant will bring blessing to all the people on the earth.&amp;quot;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">&amp;apos;Now that God raised up his Son, he has chosen to send him first to you that he might bless you by turning each one of you from your wickedness.&amp;apos;</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="4">
			<VERS vnumber="3">They had them arrested, and since it was already evening they kept them in custody until the next day.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Yet there were many in the crowd who believed the message, bringing the total number of men who believed to nearly five thousand!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">The next day many Jewish leaders, religious scholars, and elders of the people convened a meeting in Jerusalem.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Annas the high priest was there with Caiaphas, John, Alexander, and others who were members of the high priest&amp;quot;s family.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">They made Peter and John stand in front of the council as they questioned them, saying, &amp;apos;Tell us, by what power and authority have you done these things?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit, answered, &amp;apos;Respected elders and leaders of the people, listen.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Are we being put on trial today for doing an act of kindness by healing a frail, crippled man? Well then,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">you and everyone else in Israel should know that it is by the power of the name of Jesus that the crippled man stands here today completely healed! You crucified Jesus Christ of Nazareth, but God raised him from the dead.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">This Jesus is &amp;quot;the stone that you, the builders, have rejected, and now he has become the cornerstone!&amp;quot;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">There is no one else who has the power to save us, for there is only one name to whom God has given authority by which we must experience salvation: the name of Jesus .&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">The council members were astonished as they witnessed the bold courage of Peter and John, especially when they discovered that they were just ordinary men who had never had religious training. Then they began to understand the effect Jesus had on them simply by spending time with him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Standing there with them was the healed man, and there was nothing further they could say.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">So they ordered them to leave the room while they discussed the matter. Among themselves, they said,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">&amp;apos;What should we do with these men? Everyone in Jerusalem can clearly see that they&amp;quot;ve performed a notable sign and wonder&amp;ndash;we can&amp;quot;t deny that.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">But to keep this propaganda from spreading any further among the people, let&amp;quot;s threaten them severely and warn them to never speak to anyone in this name again.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">So they had them brought back in before the council, and they commanded them to never teach the people or speak again using the name of Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">But Peter and John replied, &amp;apos;You can judge for yourselves&amp;ndash;is it better to listen to you or to God?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">It&amp;quot;s impossible for us to stop speaking about all the things we&amp;quot;ve seen and heard!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Since the members of the council couldn&amp;quot;t come up with a crime they could punish them for, they threatened them once more and let them go. All the people praised God, thrilled over the miraculous healing of the crippled man.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">And the man who received this miracle sign of healing was over forty years old.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">As soon as they were released from custody, Peter and John went to the other believers and explained all that had happened with the high priest and the elders.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">When the believers heard their report, they raised their voices in unity and prayed, &amp;apos;Lord Yahweh , you are the Lord of all! You created the universe&amp;ndash;the earth, the sky, the sea, and everything that is in them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">And you spoke by the Holy Spirit through your servant David, our forefather, saying: &amp;quot;How dare the nations plan a rebellion, ranting and raging against the Lord Most High? Their foolish plots are futile! with the rulers scheming and conspiring together</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">Look at how the kings of the earth take their stand, against God and his anointed Messiah!&amp;quot;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">&amp;apos;In fact, Herod and Pontius Pilate, along with Jews and non-Jews, met together to take their stand against your holy servant, Jesus the Messiah.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">They did to him all that your purpose and will had determined, according to the destiny you had marked out for him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">So now, Lord, listen to their threats to harm us. Empower us, as your servants, to speak the word of God freely and courageously.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">Stretch out your hand of power through us to heal, and to move in signs and wonders by the name of your holy Son, Jesus!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">As they prayed the earth shook beneath them, causing the building they were in to tremble. Each one of them was filled with the Holy Spirit, and they proclaimed the word of God with unrestrained boldness.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">All the believers were one in mind and heart. Selfishness was not a part of their community, for they shared everything they had with one another.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">The apostles gave powerful testimonies about the resurrection of the Lord Jesus, and great measures of grace rested upon them all.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="5">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Now, a man named Ananias and his wife, Sapphira, likewise sold their farm.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">They conspired to secretly keep back for themselves a portion of the proceeds. So when Ananias brought the money to the apostles, it was only a portion of the entire sale.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">God revealed their secret to Peter , so he said to him, &amp;apos;Ananias, why did you let Satan fill your heart and make you think you could lie to the Holy Spirit? You only pretended to give it all, yet you hid back part of the proceeds from the sale of your property to keep for yourselves.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Before you sold it, wasn&amp;quot;t it yours to sell or to keep? And after you sold it, wasn&amp;quot;t the money entirely at your disposal? How could you plot such a thing in your heart? You haven&amp;quot;t lied to people; you&amp;quot;ve lied to God!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">The moment Ananias heard those words, he fell over dead. Everyone was terrified when they heard what had happened.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Some young men came in and removed the body and buried him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Three hours later, his wife came into the room, with no clue what had happened to her husband.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Peter said to her, &amp;apos;Tell me, were the two of you paid this amount for the sale of your land?&amp;apos; Sapphira said, &amp;apos;Yes, that&amp;quot;s how much it was.&amp;apos; When the young men came in, she was already dead, so they carried her out and buried her next to her husband. Gamaliel&amp;quot;s words convinced the council.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Peter told her, &amp;apos;Why have you agreed together to test the Spirit of the Lord? I hear the footsteps of those who buried your husband at the door&amp;ndash;they&amp;quot;re coming here to bury you too!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">At that moment she dropped dead at Peter&amp;quot;s feet.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">The entire church was seized with a powerful sense of the fear of God, which came over all who heard what had happened.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">The apostles performed many signs, wonders, and miracles among the people.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">And the believers were wonderfully united as they met regularly in the temple courts in the area known as Solomon&amp;quot;s Porch. No one dared harm them, for everyone held them in high regard.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Continually more and more people believed in the Lord and were added to their number&amp;ndash;great crowds of both men and women.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">In fact, when people knew Peter was going to walk by, they carried the sick out to the streets and laid them down on cots and mats, knowing the incredible power emanating from him would overshadow them and heal them .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Great numbers of people swarmed into Jerusalem from the nearby villages. They brought with them the sick and those troubled by demons&amp;ndash;and everyone was healed!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">The high priest and his officials, who formed the party of the Sadducees, became extremely jealous over all that was happening,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">so they had the apostles arrested, placed in chains, and thrown into jail.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">But during the night, the Lord sent an angel who appeared before them . He supernaturally opened their prison doors and brought the apostles outside.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">&amp;apos;Go,&amp;apos; the angel told them. &amp;apos;Stand in the temple courts and preach the words that bring life!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">So early that morning they entered the temple courts and taught the people. The high priest and his officials, unaware of their supernatural release from prison , convened the members of the supreme council. They sent for the apostles to be brought to them from prison.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">But when the officers came to the prison cell, it was empty! They returned to the council and informed them,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">&amp;apos;We found the jail securely locked and the guards standing by their cell, but when we opened the door, there was no one inside!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">When the captain of the temple guard and the leading priests heard this report, they were perplexed and at a loss over what to make of it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">Someone came and informed them, &amp;apos;The men you put in prison are out there standing in the temple courts, teaching the people!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">So the captain of the temple guard and his officers went to arrest them once again, but without using force, for they were afraid the people would stone them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">When they brought them before the council, the high priest demanded an explanation,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">saying, &amp;apos;Didn&amp;quot;t we strictly warn you that you were to never again teach in this name? But instead you have now filled all of Jerusalem with this doctrine and are committed to holding us responsible for this man&amp;quot;s death!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">Peter and the apostles replied, &amp;apos;We must listen to and obey God more than pleasing religious leaders.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">You had Jesus arrested and killed by crucifixion, but the God of our forefathers has raised him up.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">He&amp;quot;s the one God has exalted and seated at his right hand as our Savior and Champion. He is the provider of grace as the Redeemer of Israel.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">We are witnesses of these things, and so is the Holy Spirit, whom God freely gives to all who believe in him.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">When they heard this, they were infuriated and determined to murder them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">But a Pharisee named Gamaliel, a noted religious professor who was highly respected by all, stood up. He gave orders to send the apostles outside.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">Then he said to the council, &amp;apos;Men of Israel, you need to be very careful about how you deal with these men.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">Some time ago there was a man named Theudas who rose up claiming to be somebody. He had a following of about four hundred men, but when he was killed, all of his followers were scattered, and nothing came of it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">&amp;apos;After him, in the days of the census, another man rose up, Judas the Galilean, who got people to follow him in a revolt. He too perished, and all those who followed him were scattered.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">So in this situation, you should just leave these men to themselves. For if this plan or undertaking originates with men, it will fade away and come to nothing.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">But if this movement is of God, you won&amp;quot;t be able to stop it. And you might discover that you were fighting God all along!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">So they brought the apostles back in and had them severely beaten. They ordered them never again to speak in the name of Jesus and then let them go.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">The apostles left there rejoicing, thrilled that God had considered them worthy to suffer disgrace for the name of Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">And nothing stopped them! They kept preaching every day in the temple courts and went from house to house, preaching the gospel of Jesus, God&amp;quot;s Anointed One!</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="6">
			<VERS vnumber="1">During those days the number of Jesus&amp;quot; followers kept multiplying greatly. But a complaint was brought against those who spoke Aramaic by the Greek-speaking Jews, who felt their widows were being overlooked during the daily distribution of food.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">The twelve apostles called a meeting of all the believers and told them, &amp;apos;It is not advantageous for us to be pulled away from the word of God to wait on tables.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">We want you to carefully select from among yourselves seven godly men. Make sure they are honorable, full of the Holy Spirit and wisdom, and we will give them the responsibility of this crucial ministry of serving.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">That will enable us to give our full attention to prayer and preaching the word of God.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Everyone in the church loved this idea. So they chose seven men. One of them was Stephen, who was known as a man full of faith and overflowing with the Holy Spirit. Along with him they chose Philip, Prochorus, Nicanor, Timon, Parmenas, and Nicholas from Antioch, who had converted to Judaism.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">All seven stood before the apostles, who laid their hands on them and prayed for them, commissioning them to this ministry .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">God&amp;quot;s word reigned supreme and kept spreading. The number of Jesus&amp;quot; followers in Jerusalem quickly grew and increased by the day. Even a great number of Jewish priests became believers and were obedient to the faith!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Stephen, who was a man full of grace and supernatural power, performed many astonishing signs and wonders and mighty miracles among the people.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">This upset some men belonging to a sect who called themselves the Men Set Free. They were Libyans, Egyptians, and Turks. They all confronted Stephen to argue with him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">But the Holy Spirit gave Stephen remarkable wisdom to answer them. His words were prompted by the Holy Spirit, and they could not refute what he said.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">So the Men Set Free conspired in secret to find those who would bring false accusations against Stephen and lie about him by saying, &amp;apos;We heard this man speak blasphemy against Moses and God.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">The Men Set Free agitated the crowd, the elders, and the religious scholars, then seized Stephen and forcefully took him before the supreme council.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">One after another, false witnesses stepped forward and accused Stephen, saying, &amp;apos;This man never stops denigrating our temple and our Jewish law.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">For we have heard him teach that Jesus of Nazareth will destroy the temple and change the traditions and customs that Moses handed down to us.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Every member of the supreme council focused his gaze on Stephen, for right in front of their eyes, while being falsely accused , his face glowed as though he had the face of an angel!</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="7">
			<VERS vnumber="1">The high priest asked, &amp;apos;Are these accusations true?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Stephen replied, &amp;apos;My fellow Jews and fathers, listen to me. The God of glory appeared to our ancestor Abraham while he was living in Iraq and before he moved to Haran in Syria.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">God said to him, &amp;quot;Go! Leave behind your country and your relatives. Begin your journey and come to the land that I will show you.&amp;quot;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">&amp;apos;So Abraham left southeastern Iraq and began his journey. He settled in Haran and stayed there until his father passed away. Then God had him move to the land of Israel with only a promise.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Although God gave him no parcel of land he could call his own, not even a footprint, yet he promised Abraham that he and his descendants would one day have it all. And even though as yet Abraham had no child,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">God spoke with him and gave him this promise: &amp;quot;Your descendants will live in a foreign land with a people who will make slaves of them and your descendants will be set free I am the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.&amp;quot; &amp;apos;Trembling in God&amp;quot;s presence and overwhelmed with awe, Moses didn&amp;quot;t even dare to look into the fire. I have heard their painful groaning, and now I have come down to set them free. So come to me, Moses, &amp;quot;People of Israel, you failed to worship me when you offered animal sacrifices for forty years in the wilderness. and you carried his tabernacle, not mine. You made idols with your hands and worshiped them instead of me. So now I will cast you into exile beyond Babylon.&amp;quot; is but a footstool for my feet. How could you possibly build a house that could contain me?&amp;quot; says the Lord Yahweh . &amp;quot;And where could you find a place where I could live? and oppress them for four hundred years. to return to this land to serve and worship me.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Take the sandals off your feet, for you are standing in the realm of holiness. have been mistreated in Egypt. for I am sending you to Egypt to represent me.&amp;quot; You worshiped your star-god, Rephan. that have built my house, not yours?&amp;quot;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">But I will judge the nation that enslaves them,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">&amp;apos;Then God entered into covenant with Abraham, which included the requirement of circumcision. So when he became the father of Isaac, he circumcised him eight days after his birth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">&amp;apos;Isaac then became the father of Jacob, who was the father of our twelve patriarchs. Jacob&amp;quot;s sons became jealous of their brother Joseph and sold him to be a slave in Egypt. But God&amp;quot;s favor and blessing rested upon Joseph, and in time,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">God rescued him from all his oppression and granted him extraordinary favor before Pharaoh, the king of Egypt. Pharaoh appointed him as the overseer of his nation and even of his own palace.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">&amp;apos;Then a devastating famine came over all of Egypt and Canaan, bringing great misery to the people, including our ancestors, who couldn&amp;quot;t find food.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">But when Jacob learned that there was food in Egypt, he sent his sons, our ancestors, on their first trip to purchase grain for their family.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">On their second trip to Egypt, Joseph revealed his identity to his brothers, and because of this, Pharaoh learned about Joseph&amp;quot;s family and where he came from.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">&amp;apos;Joseph sent for his father, Jacob, and his entire family, a total of seventy-five people, to come and reside in Egypt.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Eventually, Jacob died there, along with all of his sons, our forefathers.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Their bones were later carried back to the promised land and buried in Shechem, in the tomb Abraham had purchased for a sum of money from the sons of Hamor.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">&amp;apos;The time drew near for God to fulfill the prophetic promise he had made to Abraham. Our Jewish people had increased greatly in number, multiplying many times over while in Egypt.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">&amp;apos;Another king, who had forgotten how Joseph had made their nation great , arose to rule over Egypt.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">He was an abusive king who exploited our people with his smooth talk. With cruelty he forced our ancestors to give up their little boys as he committed infanticide!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">&amp;apos;Then Moses came on the scene&amp;ndash;a child of divine beauty. His parents hid him from Pharaoh as long as they could to spare his life. After three months they could conceal him no longer,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">so they had to abandon him to his fate. But God arranged that Pharaoh&amp;quot;s daughter would find him, take him home, and raise him as her own son.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">So Moses was fully trained in the royal courts and educated in the highest wisdom Egypt had to offer, until he arose as a powerful prince and an eloquent orator.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">&amp;apos;When Moses turned forty, his heart was stirred for his people, the Israelites.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">One day he saw one of our people being violently mistreated, so he came to his rescue, and with his own hands Moses murdered the abusive Egyptian.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">Moses hoped that when the people realized how he had rescued one of their own, they would recognize him as their deliverer. How wrong he was!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">The next day he came upon two of our people engaged in a fist fight, and he tried to break it up by saying, &amp;quot;Men, you are brothers! Why would you want to hurt each other?&amp;quot;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">&amp;apos;But the perpetrator pushed Moses aside and said, &amp;quot;Who do you think you are? Who appointed you to be our ruler and judge?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">Are you going to kill me like you did the Egyptian yesterday?&amp;quot;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">&amp;apos;Shaken by this, Moses fled Egypt and lived as an exile in the land of Midian, where he became the father of two sons.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">After forty years had passed, while he was in the desert near Mount Sinai, the Messenger of Yahweh appeared to him in the midst of a flaming thorn bush.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">Moses was astonished and stunned by what he was seeing, so he drew closer to observe this marvel. Then the Lord Yahweh spoke to him out of the flames:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">&amp;quot;I am the living God, the God of your ancestors.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">&amp;apos;Out of the flames the Lord Yahweh said to him:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">I have watched and seen how my people</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">&amp;apos;So God sent back to Egypt the man our people rejected and refused to recognize by saying, &amp;quot;Who appointed you to be our ruler and judge?&amp;quot; God sent this man back to be their ruler and deliverer, commissioned with the power of the messenger who appeared to him in the flaming thorn bush.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">This man brought the people out from their Egyptian bondage with many astonishing wonders and miracle signs&amp;ndash;miracles in Egypt, miracles at the Red Sea, and miracles during their forty-year journey through the wilderness.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">This is the same Moses who said to our ancestors, &amp;quot;The Lord God will raise up one from among you who will be a prophet to you, like I have been. Listen to everything he will say!&amp;quot;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">&amp;apos;Moses led the congregation in the wilderness and he spoke face-to-face with the angel who spoke with him on the top of Mount Sinai. Along with our ancestors, he received the living oracles of God that were passed down to us.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">But our forefathers refused to obey. They pushed him away, and their hearts longed to return to Egypt.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">&amp;apos;While Moses was on the mountain, our forefathers said to Aaron, &amp;quot;Make us gods to lead us, because we don&amp;quot;t know what has become of this Moses who brought us out of Egypt.&amp;quot;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">&amp;apos;So they made a god, an idol in the form of a bull calf. They offered sacrifices to it and celebrated with delight what their own hands had made.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">&amp;apos;When God saw what they had done, he turned away from them and handed them over to the worship of the stars of heaven, as recorded in the prophetic writings:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43">Instead you worshiped the god Moloch,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44">&amp;apos;God gave Moses the revelation of the pattern of the tabernacle of the testimony. By God&amp;quot;s command, he made it exactly according to the specifications given to him for our ancestors in the wilderness.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45">The next generation received possession of it, and under Joshua&amp;quot;s leadership they took possession of the land of the nations, which God drove out in front of them. The tabernacle was carried about until</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46">David found loving favor with God and prayed for a dwelling place for the God of Jacob,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="47">but it was Solomon who built him a house.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="48">&amp;apos;However, the Most High God does not live in temples made by human hands, as the prophet said:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="49">&amp;quot;Heaven is my throne room and the earth</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="50">Don&amp;quot;t you know that it is my hands</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="51">&amp;apos;Why would you be so stubborn as to close your hearts and your ears to me? You are always opposing the Holy Spirit, just like your forefathers!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="52">Which prophet was not persecuted and murdered by your ancestors? Name just one! They killed them all&amp;ndash;even the ones who prophesied long ago of the coming of the Righteous One! Now you follow in their steps and have become his betrayers and murderers.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="53">You have been given the law by the visitation of angels, but you have not obeyed it.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="54">When they heard these things, they were overtaken with violent rage filling their souls, and they gnashed their teeth at him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="55">But Stephen, overtaken with great faith, was full of the Holy Spirit. He fixed his gaze into the heavenly realm and saw the glory and splendor of God&amp;ndash;and Jesus, who stood up at the right hand of God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="56">&amp;apos;Look!&amp;apos; Stephen said. &amp;apos;I can see the heavens opening and the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God to welcome me home !&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="57">His accusers covered their ears with their hands and screamed at the top of their lungs to drown out his voice.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="58">Then they pounced on him and threw him outside the city walls to stone him. His accusers, one by one, placed their outer garments at the feet of a young man named Saul of Tarsus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="59">As they hurled stone after stone at him, Stephen prayed, &amp;apos;Our Lord Jesus, accept my spirit into your presence.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="60">He crumpled to his knees and shouted in a loud voice, &amp;apos;Our Lord, don&amp;quot;t hold this sin against them.&amp;apos; And then he died.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="8">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Now, Saul agreed to be an accomplice to Stephen&amp;quot;s stoning and participated in his execution. From that day on, a great persecution of the church in Jerusalem began. All the believers scattered into the countryside of Judea and among the Samaritans, except the apostles who remained behind in Jerusalem.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">God-fearing men gave Stephen a proper burial and mourned greatly over his death.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Then Saul mercilessly persecuted the church of God, going from house to house into the homes of believers to arrest both men and women and drag them off to prison.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Although the believers were scattered by persecution, they preached the wonderful news of the word of God wherever they went.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Philip traveled to a Samaritan city and preached to them the wonderful news of the Anointed One.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">The crowds were eager to receive Philip&amp;quot;s message and were persuaded by the many miracles and wonders he performed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Many demon-possessed people were set free and delivered as evil spirits came out of them with loud screams and shrieks, and many who were lame and paralyzed were also healed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">This resulted in an uncontainable joy filling the city!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Now, there was a man who lived there who was steeped in sorcery. For some time he had astounded the people of Samaria with his magic, boasting to be someone great.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Everyone, from the least to the greatest among them, was dazzled by his sorcery, saying, &amp;apos;This man is the greatest wizard of all! The divine power of God walks among us!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">For many years everyone was in awe of him because of his astonishing displays of the magic arts.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">But as Philip preached the wonderful news of God&amp;quot;s kingdom realm, and the name of Jesus the Anointed One, many believed his message and were baptized, both men and women.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Even Simon believed and was baptized! Wherever Philip went, Simon was right by his side, astounded by all the miracles, signs, and enormous displays of power that he witnessed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">When the apostles in Jerusalem heard that the Samaritans had accepted God&amp;quot;s message of life, they sent Peter and John</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">to pray over them so that they would receive the Holy Spirit.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">For they had only been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus and were yet to have the Holy Spirit fall upon them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">As soon as Peter and John arrived, they laid their hands on the Samaritan believers, one after another, and the Holy Spirit fell and filled each one of them!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">When Simon saw how the Holy Spirit was released through the laying on of the apostles&amp;quot; hands, he approached them and offered them money,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">saying, &amp;apos;I want this power too. I&amp;quot;m willing to pay you for the anointing that you have, so that I also can lay my hands on everyone to receive the Holy Spirit.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Peter rebuked him and said, &amp;apos;Your money will go with you to destruction! How could you even think that you could purchase God&amp;quot;s supernatural gift with money?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">You will never have this gift or take part in this ministry, for your heart is not right with God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Repent this moment for allowing such wickedness to fill you. Plead with the Lord that perhaps he would forgive you the treachery of your heart.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">For I discern that jealous envy has poisoned you and binds you as a captive to sin.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">Simon begged, &amp;apos;Peter, please pray to God for me. Plead with him so that nothing you just said over me may come to pass!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">After Peter and John had testified and taught the word of God in that city, they returned to Jerusalem, stopping at many Samaritan villages along the way to preach the hope of the gospel.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">Then the Lord&amp;quot;s angel said to Philip, &amp;apos;Now go south from Jerusalem on the desert road to Gaza.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">He left immediately on his assignment. Along the way he encountered an Ethiopian who believed in the God of the Jews , who was the minister of finance for Candace, queen of Ethiopia. He was on his way home from worshiping God in Jerusalem. For his life was taken from the earth. The man answered, &amp;apos;I believe that Jesus is the Anointed One, the Son of God.&amp;apos; The man never saw Philip again. He returned to Ethiopia full of great joy. Philip, however, traveled on to all of the towns of that region, bringing them the good news, until he arrived at Caesarea.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">As he rode along in his chariot, he was reading from the scroll of Isaiah.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">The Holy Spirit said to Philip, &amp;apos;Go and walk alongside the chariot.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">So Philip ran to catch up. As he drew closer he overheard the man reading from the scroll of Isaiah the prophet. Philip asked him, &amp;apos;Sir, do you understand what you&amp;quot;re reading?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">The man answered, &amp;apos;How can I possibly make sense of this without someone explaining it to me?&amp;apos; So he invited Philip up into his chariot to sit with him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">The portion from Isaiah he was reading was this: He was led away to the slaughter like a lamb to be offered. He was like a lamb that is silent before those who sheared him&amp;ndash; he never even opened his mouth. And who could fully express his struggles?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">In his lowliness justice was stripped away from him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">The Ethiopian asked Philip, &amp;apos;Please, can you tell me who the prophet is speaking of? Is it himself or another man?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">Philip started with this passage and shared with him the wonderful message of Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">As they were traveling down the road, the man said, &amp;apos;Look, here&amp;quot;s a pool of water. Why don&amp;quot;t I get baptized right now?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">Philip replied, &amp;apos;If you believe with all your heart, I&amp;quot;ll baptize you.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">The Ethiopian stopped his chariot, and they went down into the water and Philip baptized him.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="9">
			<VERS vnumber="1">During those days, Saul, full of angry threats and rage, wanted to murder the disciples of the Lord Jesus. So he went to ask the high priest</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">and requested a letter of authorization he could take to the Jewish leaders in Damascus, requesting their cooperation in finding and arresting any who were followers of the Way. Saul wanted to capture all of the believers he found, both men and women, and drag them as prisoners back to Jerusalem.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">So he obtained the authorization and left for Damascus. Just outside the city, a brilliant light flashing from heaven suddenly exploded all around him. Saul replied, &amp;apos;Who are you, Lord?&amp;apos; &amp;apos;Yes, Lord,&amp;apos; Ananias answered. There were many widows standing next to Peter, weeping. One after another showed him the tunics and other garments that Tabitha had made to bless others. At once she opened her eyes, and seeing Peter, she sat up.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Falling to the ground, he heard a booming voice say to him, &amp;apos;Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Saul stood to his feet, and even though his eyes were open he could see nothing&amp;ndash;he was blind. So the men had to take him by the hand and lead him into Damascus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">For three days he didn&amp;quot;t eat or drink and couldn&amp;quot;t see a thing.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Living in Damascus was a believer named Ananias. The Lord spoke to him in a vision, calling his name. &amp;apos;Ananias.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">&amp;apos;But Lord,&amp;apos; Ananias replied, &amp;apos;many have told me about his terrible persecution of those in Jerusalem who are devoted to you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">In fact, the high priest has authorized him to seize and imprison all those in Damascus who call on your name.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">The Lord Yahweh answered him, &amp;apos;Arise and go! I have chosen this man to be my special messenger. He will be brought before kings, before many nations, and before the Jewish people to give them the revelation of who I am.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">And I will show him how much he is destined to suffer because of his passion for me.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Ananias left and found the house where Saul was staying. He went inside and laid hands on him, saying, &amp;apos;Saul, my brother, the Lord Jesus, who appeared to you on the road, has sent me to pray for you so that you might see again and be filled to overflowing with the Holy Spirit.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">All at once, the crusty substance that was over Saul&amp;quot;s eyes disappeared and he could see perfectly. Immediately, he got up and was baptized.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">After eating a meal, his strength returned.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Within the hour he was in the synagogues, preaching about Jesus and proclaiming, &amp;apos;Jesus is the Son of God!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Those who heard him were astonished, saying among themselves, &amp;apos;Isn&amp;quot;t this the Saul who furiously persecuted those in Jerusalem who called on the name of Jesus? Didn&amp;quot;t he come here with permission from the high priest to drag them off and take them as prisoners?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Saul&amp;quot;s power increased greatly as he became more and more proficient in proving that Jesus was the anointed Messiah. Saul remained there for several days with the disciples, even though it agitated the Jews of Damascus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">As time passed, the Jews plotted together to kill Saul,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">but it was revealed to him what they were about to do. They closely guarded the gates of the city and tracked his every movement so they could kill him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">But during the night, some of Saul&amp;quot;s converts helped him escape by lowering him down through an opening in the wall, hiding him in a woven basket.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">When Saul arrived in Jerusalem, he attempted to introduce himself to the fellowship of the believers, but everyone was afraid of him because they doubted he was a true disciple.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">Barnabas came to his defense and brought him before the apostles. Saul shared with them his supernatural experience of seeing the Lord, who spoke with him on the road to Damascus. Barnabas also told them how boldly Saul preached throughout the city in Jesus&amp;quot; mighty name.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">Then they accepted him as a brother and he remained with them, joining them wherever they went in Jerusalem, boldly preaching in the power and authority of Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">He openly debated with some of the Jews who had adopted the Greek culture, yet they were secretly plotting to murder him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">When the believers discovered their scheme, they smuggled him out of the city and took him to Caesarea and then sent him on to Tarsus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">After this, the church all over Judea, Galilee, and Samaria experienced a season of peace. The congregations grew larger and larger, with the believers being empowered and encouraged by the Holy Spirit. They worshiped God in wonder and awe, and walked in the fear of the Lord.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">As Peter was ministering from place to place, he visited God&amp;quot;s devoted ones in the village of Lydda.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">He met a man there named Aeneas who had been paralyzed and bedridden for eight years.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">Peter said to him, &amp;apos;Aeneas, Jesus the Anointed One instantly and divinely heals you. Now, get up and make your bed.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">All at once he stood to his feet. And when all the people of Lydda and Sharon saw him, they became believers in the Lord.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">Now, there was a follower of Jesus who lived in Joppa. Her Aramaic name, Tabitha, means &amp;apos;gazelle.&amp;apos; She lived her life doing kind things for others and serving the poor.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">But then she became very ill and died. After the disciples prepared her body for burial, they laid her in an upstairs room.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">When the believers heard that Peter was nearby in Lydda, they sent two men with an urgent message for him to come without delay.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">So Peter went with them back to Joppa, and upon arriving they led him to the upper room.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">Peter made them all leave the room. Then he knelt down and prayed. Turning to the dead body, he said, &amp;apos;Tabitha, rise up!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">He took her by the hand and helped her to her feet. Then he called for the believers and all the widows to come and see that she was alive!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">The news spread all over the city of Joppa, and many believed in the Lord.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43">Peter remained in Joppa for several more days as a guest at the house of Simon the tanner.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="10">
			<VERS vnumber="1">At that time there was a Roman military officer, Cornelius, who was in charge of one hundred men stationed in Caesarea. He was the captain of the Italian regiment,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">a devout man of extraordinary character who worshiped God and prayed regularly, together with all his family. He also had a heart for the poor and gave generously to help them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">One afternoon about three o&amp;quot;clock, he had an open vision and saw the angel of God appear right in front of him, calling out his name, &amp;apos;Cornelius!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Startled, he was overcome with fear by the sight of the angel. He asked, &amp;apos;What do you want, Lord?&amp;apos; The angel said, &amp;apos;All of your prayers and your generosity to the poor have ascended before God as an eternal offering. After their baptism, they asked Peter to stay with them for a few more days.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Now, send some men to Joppa at once. Have them find a man named Simon the Rock,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">who is staying as a guest in the home of Simon the tanner, whose house is by the sea.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">After the angel left, Cornelius called for two of his servants and a trusted, godly soldier who was his personal attachÃ©.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">He explained to them everything that had just happened and sent them off to Joppa.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">The next day around noon, as Cornelius&amp;quot; men were approaching Joppa, Peter went up to the flat roof of the house to pray.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">He was hungry and wanted to eat, but while lunch was being prepared he fell into a trance and entered into another realm.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">As the heavenly realm opened up, he saw something resembling a large linen tablecloth that descended from above, being let down to the earth by its four corners.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">As it floated down he saw that it held many kinds of four-footed animals, reptiles, and wild birds.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">A voice said to him, &amp;apos;Peter, go and prepare them to be eaten.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Peter replied, &amp;apos;There&amp;quot;s no way I could do that, Lord, for I&amp;quot;ve never eaten anything forbidden or impure according to our Jewish laws .&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">The voice spoke again. &amp;apos;Nothing is unclean if God declares it to be clean.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">The vision was repeated three times. Then suddenly the linen sheet was snatched back up into heaven.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Peter was so stunned by the vision that he couldn&amp;quot;t stop wondering about what all it meant. Meanwhile, Cornelius&amp;quot; men had learned where Peter was staying and at that same moment were standing outside the gate.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">They called out to those in the house, &amp;apos;Is this where Simon, the Rock, is staying?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Peter went downstairs to the men and said, &amp;apos;I believe I&amp;quot;m the one you&amp;quot;re looking for. What brings you here?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">They answered, &amp;apos;We serve Cornelius, a Roman military captain, who sent us to find you. He is a devout man of the highest integrity who worships God and is respected throughout the Jewish community. He was divinely instructed through the appearance of an angel to summon you to his home and to listen to the message that you would bring him.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">Peter invited them to stay for the night as his guests. The next morning they departed, accompanied by some of the believers from Joppa.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">The next day they arrived in Caesarea, where Cornelius was waiting anxiously for them and had gathered together all of his relatives and close friends.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">The moment Peter walked in the door, Cornelius fell at his feet to worship him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">But Peter pulled him to his feet and said, &amp;apos;Stand up, for I&amp;quot;m only a man and no different from you.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">They talked together and then went inside, where Peter found a large gathering waiting to hear his words .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">Peter said to them, &amp;apos;You all know that it is against the Jewish laws for me to associate with or even visit the home of one who is not a Jew. Yet God has shown me that I should never view anyone as inferior or ritually unclean.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">So when you sent for me, I came without objection. Now, may I ask why you sent for me?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">Cornelius replied, &amp;apos;Four days ago I was fasting and praying here in my home at this very hour, three o&amp;quot;clock in the afternoon, when a man in glistening clothing suddenly appeared in front of my eyes.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">He said, &amp;quot;Cornelius, God has heard your prayers. Your generosity to the poor has been recorded and remembered in God&amp;quot;s presence.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">However, you must send for a man named Simon, the Rock, who is staying in Joppa as a guest of Simon the tanner, who lives by the sea.&amp;quot;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">So I immediately sent my men to bring you here&amp;ndash;and you were kind enough to come. And now, here we are, all of us in God&amp;quot;s presence, anxious to hear the message that God has put into your heart to share with us.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">Peter said, &amp;apos;Now I know for certain that God doesn&amp;quot;t show favoritism with people but treats everyone on the same basis .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">It makes no difference what race of people one belongs to. If they show deep reverence for God, and are committed to doing what&amp;quot;s right, they are acceptable before him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">God sent his word to the Jewish people first, announcing the wonderful news of hope and peace through Jesus, the Anointed One, the Lord of all.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">You are well aware of all that began in Galilee and spread throughout the land of Israel immediately after John preached his message of baptism.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">&amp;apos;Jesus of Nazareth was anointed by God with the Holy Spirit and with great power. He did wonderful things for others and divinely healed all who were under the tyranny of the devil, for God had anointed him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">We apostles were eyewitnesses to all the miracles that he performed throughout the land of Israel. Finally, in Jerusalem, he was crucified on a cross,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">but God raised him from the dead three days later, allowing him to be seen openly.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">He didn&amp;quot;t appear to everyone, but he appeared to us, his chosen witnesses. He actually ate and drank with us after he rose from the dead!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">&amp;apos;Jesus ordered us to preach and warn the people that God had appointed him to be the judge of the living and the dead.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43">And not only us , but all of the prophets agree in their writings that everyone who believes in him receives complete forgiveness of sins through the power of his name.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44">While Peter was speaking, the Holy Spirit cascaded over all those listening to his message.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45">The Jewish brothers who had accompanied Peter were astounded that the gift of the Holy Spirit was poured out on people who weren&amp;quot;t Jews,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46">for they heard them speaking in supernaturally given languages and passionately praising God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="47">Peter said, &amp;apos;How could anyone object to these people being baptized? For they have received the Holy Spirit just as we have.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="48">So he instructed them to be baptized in the power of the name of Jesus, the Anointed One.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="11">
			<VERS vnumber="1">The news traveled fast and soon reached the apostles and the believers living in Judea that non-Jewish people were also receiving God&amp;quot;s message of new life .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">When Peter finally arrived in Jerusalem, the Jewish believers called him to task, saying,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">&amp;apos;Why did you stay in the home of people who aren&amp;quot;t Jewish? You even ate your meals with them!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Peter explained what had happened, saying,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">&amp;apos;One day when I was in the city of Joppa, while I was praying I fell into an ecstatic trance and I went into another realm. I saw in a vision something like a linen tablecloth descending out of heaven, being let down by its four corners, and it got close to me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">As I examined it I saw many four-footed animals, wild animals, reptiles, and wild birds.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Then I heard a voice say to me, &amp;quot;Get up, Peter. Kill and eat them.&amp;quot;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">&amp;apos;I said, &amp;quot;I can&amp;quot;t do that, Lord! For I&amp;quot;ve never eaten anything that is forbidden or impure according to our Jewish laws.&amp;quot;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">&amp;apos;The voice spoke to me again, saying, &amp;quot;Nothing is unclean if God declares it to be clean.&amp;quot;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">&amp;apos;The vision repeated itself three times. Then suddenly the linen sheet was snatched back up into heaven.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">At that moment three men from Caesarea, who had been sent for me, approached the house where I was staying.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">The Spirit told me to accompany them with no questions asked. These six brothers here with me made the trip, and we entered into the home of the man who had sent for me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">He shared with us about the angel who appeared to him and told him to send messengers to Joppa to find Simon, the Rock. The angel had told him,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">&amp;quot;He will tell you and your family the message of how you can be saved!&amp;quot;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">&amp;apos;Shortly after I began to speak, the Holy Spirit was poured out upon them, just like what happened to us at the beginning.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">And I remembered the words the Lord had told us: &amp;quot;John immersed you in water, but you will be immersed in the Holy Spirit.&amp;quot;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">So I concluded that if God is pleased to give them the same gift of the Holy Spirit that he gave us after they believed in the Lord Jesus Christ, who am I to stand in the way of God?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">When they heard this, their objections were put to rest and they all glorified God, saying, &amp;apos;Look what God has done! He&amp;quot;s giving the gift of repentance that leads to life to people who aren&amp;quot;t even Jews.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Because of the persecution triggered by Stephen&amp;quot;s death in Jerusalem, many of the believers were scattered. Some reached as far as the coast of Lebanon, the island of Cyprus, and Antioch of Syria, but they were still only preaching the word to Jews.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">However, some of the believers from Cyprus and Cyrene, who had come to Antioch in Syria, preached to the non-Jews living there, proclaiming the message of salvation in the Lord Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">The mighty power of the Lord was with them as they ministered, and a large number of people believed and turned their hearts to the Lord.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">News of what was happening in Antioch reached the church of Jerusalem, so the apostles sent Barnabas to Antioch as their emissary.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">When he got there and witnessed for himself God&amp;quot;s marvelous grace, he was enthused and overjoyed. He encouraged the believers to remain faithful and cling to the Lord with passionate hearts.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">Barnabas was a good man, full of the Spirit of holiness, and he exuded a life of faith. Because of his ministry even more crowds of people were brought to the Lord!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">Barnabas left for Tarsus to find Saul and bring him back to Antioch.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">Together Saul and Barnabas ministered there for a full year, equipping the growing church and teaching the vast number of new converts. It was in Antioch that the followers of Jesus were first revealed as &amp;apos;anointed ones.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">At that time there were prophets in the church of Jerusalem, and some of them came to Antioch.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">One of them, named Agabus, stood up in one of the meetings and prophesied by the Holy Spirit that a severe famine was about to come over Israel. (This prophecy was fulfilled during the reign of Claudius Caesar.)</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">So they determined that each believer, according to his or her ability, would give an offering to send as relief to the brothers living in Judea.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">They set aside the gifts and entrusted the funds to Barnabas and Saul to take to the elders of the church in Jerusalem.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="12">
			<VERS vnumber="1">During this period King Herod incited persecution against the church, causing great harm to the believers.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">He even had the apostle Jacob, John&amp;quot;s brother, beheaded.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">The church went into a season of intense intercession, asking God to free him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">The night before Herod planned to bring him to trial, he made sure that Peter was securely bound with two chains. Peter was sound asleep between two soldiers, with additional guards stationed outside his cell door,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">when all at once an angel of the Lord appeared, filling his prison cell with a brilliant light. The angel struck Peter on the side to awaken him and said, &amp;apos;Hurry up! Let&amp;quot;s go!&amp;apos; Instantly the chains fell off his wrists.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">The angel told him, &amp;apos;Get dressed. Put on your sandals, bring your cloak, and follow me.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Peter quickly left the cell and followed the angel, even though he thought it was only a dream or a vision, for it seemed unreal&amp;ndash;he couldn&amp;quot;t believe it was really happening!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">They walked unseen past the first guard post and then the second before coming to the iron gate that leads to the city&amp;ndash;and the gate swung open all by itself right in front of them! They went out into the city and were walking down a narrow street when all of a sudden the angel disappeared.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">That&amp;quot;s when Peter realized that he wasn&amp;quot;t having a dream! He said to himself, &amp;apos;This is really happening! The Lord sent his angel to rescue me from the clutches of Herod and from what the Jewish leaders planned to do to me.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">When he realized this, he decided to go to the home of Mary and her son John Mark. The house was filled with people praying.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">When he knocked on the door to the courtyard, a young servant girl named Rose got up to see who it was.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">When she recognized Peter&amp;quot;s voice, she was so excited that she forgot to open the door, but ran back inside the house to announce, &amp;apos;Peter is standing outside!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">&amp;apos;Are you crazy?&amp;apos; they said to her. But when she kept insisting, they answered, &amp;apos;Well, it must be his angel.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Meanwhile, Peter was still outside, knocking on the door. When they finally opened it, they were shocked to find Peter standing there.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">He signaled for them to be quiet as he shared with them the miraculous way the Lord brought him out of prison. Before he left he said, &amp;apos;Make sure you let Jacob and all of the other believers know what has happened.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">At the first sign of daylight, the prison guards were in a tremendous uproar because of Peter&amp;quot;s disappearance. Herod ordered a thorough search for him, but no one could find him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">After he interrogated the guards, he ordered them executed. Then Herod left the province of Judea for Caesarea and stayed there for a period of time.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Now, during those days, Herod was engaged in a violent dispute with the people of Tyre and Sidon. So they sent a united delegation to Caesarea to appeal to him and reconcile their differences with the king, for Herod controlled their food supply. First they enlisted the support of his trusted personal assistant, Blastus, who secured them an appointment with the king.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">On the chosen day, Herod came before them, arrayed in his regal robes. Sitting on his elevated throne, he delivered a stirring public address to the people.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">At its conclusion the people gave him a round of applause. The crowd shouted, &amp;apos;These are the words of a god, not a man!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">Immediately, an angel of the Lord struck Herod with a sickness, an infestation of worms, because he accepted the people&amp;quot;s worship and didn&amp;quot;t give the glory to God, and he died.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">But the hope of God&amp;quot;s kingdom kept spreading and multiplying everywhere!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">After Barnabas and Saul had delivered the charitable offering for relief , they left Jerusalem, bringing with them a disciple named Mark (who was also known as John).</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="13">
			<VERS vnumber="1">In the church at Antioch there were a number of prophets and teachers of the Word, including Barnabas, Simeon from Niger, Lucius the Libyan, Manean (the childhood companion of King Herod Antipas), and Saul.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">While they were worshiping as priests before the Lord in prayer and fasting, the Holy Spirit said, &amp;apos;I have called Barnabas and Saul to do an important work for me. Now, release them to go and fulfill it.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">So after they had fasted and prayed, they laid hands on them and sent them off.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">From there they crossed the island as far as Paphos, where they encountered a Jewish false prophet, a sorcerer named Elymas, who also went by the name of &amp;apos;son of Jesus.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">He had gained influence as the spiritual advisor to the regional governor, Sergius Paulus, considered by many to be a wise and intelligent leader. The governor requested a meeting with Barnabas and Saul because he wanted to hear the message of God&amp;quot;s word.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">But Elymas, whose name means &amp;apos;sorcerer,&amp;apos; stood up against them and tried to prevent the governor from believing their message.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Saul, also known as Paul, stared into his eyes and rebuked him. Filled with the Holy Spirit, he said,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">&amp;apos;You son of the devil! You are full of every form of fraud and deceit and an enemy of all that is right. When will you stop perverting the truth of God into lies?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">At this very moment the hand of God&amp;quot;s judgment comes down upon you and you will be blind&amp;ndash;so blind you won&amp;quot;t even be able to see the light of the sun.&amp;apos; As Paul spoke these words, a shadowy mist and darkness came over the sorcerer, leaving him blind and groping about, begging someone to lead him around by the hand. &amp;quot;Today I reveal you as my Son, and I as your Father.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;I will give to you what I gave to David: Faithful mercies that you can trust.&amp;quot; to experience bodily decay.&amp;quot; you won&amp;quot;t even believe that it was I who did it!&amp;quot; &amp;apos; and release salvation to the ends of the earth!&amp;quot; &amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">When the governor witnessed this, he believed and was awestruck by the power of the message of the Lord.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Paul and his companions sailed from the Cyprus port of Paphos to Perga in southern Turkey. John left them there and returned to Jerusalem</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">as they journeyed on to the city of Antioch in the region of Pisidia. On the Sabbath they went into the synagogue and took their seats. &amp;apos;Then God raised up deliverers for the people until the time of the prophet Samuel. &amp;apos;Then they took him down from the cross and laid him in a tomb. &amp;quot;You will not allow your holy one For in your day I will do something so wonderful that when I perform mighty deeds among you, &amp;quot;I have destined you to become a beacon light for the nations</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">After the reading from the scrolls of the books of Moses and the prophets, the leader of the meeting sent Paul and Barnabas a message, saying, &amp;apos;Brothers, do you have a word of encouragement to share with us? If so, please feel free to give it.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Paul stood and motioned that he had something to say. He said, &amp;apos;Listen, all of you Jews and non-Jews who worship God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">The God of Israel divinely chose our ancestors to be his people. While they were enslaved in Egypt, he made them great, both in numbers and in strength, until he unveiled his mighty power and led them out of bondage.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">For nearly forty years, he nourished them in the wilderness.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">He was the one who destroyed the seven nations inhabiting the land of Canaan and afterward gave the land to his people as their inheritance.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">This took about four hundred and fifty years.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">The people craved for a king, so God gave them one from the tribe of Benjamin: Saul, the son of Kish, who ruled for forty years.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">After removing him, God raised up David to be king, for God said of him, &amp;quot;I have found in David, son of Jesse, a man who always pursues my heart and will accomplish all that I have destined him to do.&amp;quot;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">&amp;apos;From David&amp;quot;s lineage God brought Israel a Savior, just as he promised.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">So before Jesus appeared, John preached the message of a baptism of repentance to prepare all of Israel.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">As John was about to finish his mission, he said repeatedly, &amp;quot;If you think that I am the one to come, you&amp;quot;re mistaken. He will come after me, and I don&amp;quot;t even deserve to stoop down and untie his sandals!&amp;quot;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">&amp;apos;Fellow Jews, Abraham&amp;quot;s descendants, and all those among you who worship and reverence God, this message of life has been sent for us all to hear.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">But the people of Jerusalem and their leaders didn&amp;quot;t realize who he was, nor did they understand the prophecies written of him. Yet they fulfilled those very prophecies, which they read week after week in their meetings, by condemning him to death.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">Even though they could come up with no legal grounds for the death sentence, they pleaded with Pilate to have him executed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">And they did to him all that was prophesied they would do.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">But God raised him from the dead!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">And for many days afterward he appeared on numerous occasions to his disciples who knew him well and had followed him from Galilee to Jerusalem. Those disciples are now his witnesses, telling the people the truth about him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">&amp;apos;So here we are to share with you some wonderful news! The promise God made to our forefathers</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">has now been fulfilled for us, their children. For God has raised Jesus from the dead, as it says in Psalms:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">&amp;apos;God had promised to not let him decay in the tomb or face destruction again, so God raised him from the dead. He gave this promise in the Psalms:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">&amp;apos;He explains it further in another Psalm:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">&amp;apos;This cannot be a reference to David, for after he passionately served God&amp;quot;s purpose for his generation, he died. He was buried with his ancestors and his body experienced decay.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">But the one whom God raised from the dead has never experienced corruption in any form.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">&amp;apos;So listen, friends! Through this Jesus, the forgiveness of sins is offered to you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">Everyone who believes in him is set free from sin and guilt&amp;ndash;something the law of Moses had no power to do.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">So be very careful that what the prophets warned about does not happen to you:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">&amp;quot;Be amazed and in agony, you scoffers!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">As Paul and Barnabas started to leave, the people pleaded with them to share more about these things on the next Sabbath day.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43">When the meeting had finally broken up, many of those in attendance, both Jews and converts to Judaism, tagged along with Paul and Barnabas, who continued to persuade them to go deeper in their understanding of God&amp;quot;s grace.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44">The following week, nearly everyone in the city gathered to hear the word of God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45">When the Jewish leaders saw the size of the crowds, vicious jealousy filled their hearts and they rose up to oppose what Paul was teaching. They insulted him and argued with him over everything he said.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46">Yet Paul and Barnabas did not back down. Filled with courage, they boldly replied, &amp;apos;We were compelled to bring God&amp;quot;s message first to you Jews. But seeing you&amp;quot;ve rejected this message and refuse to embrace eternal life, we will focus instead on the nations and offer it to them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="47">This will fulfill what the Lord has commanded us:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="48">When the non-Jewish people in the crowd heard these words, they were thrilled and they honored the word of the Lord. All who believed that they were destined to experience eternal life received the message.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="49">God&amp;quot;s word spread like wildfire throughout the entire region.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="50">The Jewish leaders stirred up a violent mob against Paul and Barnabas, including many prominent and wealthy people of the city. They persecuted them and ran them out of town.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="51">As they left, they shook the dust off their feet as a sign of protest against them, and they went on to the city of Iconium.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="52">They left the new converts in Antioch overflowing with the joy of the Holy Spirit.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="14">
			<VERS vnumber="1">When Paul and Barnabas arrived at Iconium, the same thing happened there. They went, as they always did, to the synagogue and preached to the people with such power that a large crowd of both Jews and non-Jews believed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Some of the Jews refused to believe, and they began to poison the minds of the non-Jews to discredit the believers.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Yet Paul and Barnabas stayed there for a long time, preaching boldly and fearlessly about the Lord. Many trusted in the Lord, for he backed up his message of grace with miracles, signs, and wonders performed by the apostles.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">The people of the city were split over the issue. Some sided with the apostles, and others with the Jews who refused to believe .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Eventually, all the opposition factions came together, with their leaders devising a plot to harm Paul and Barnabas and stone them to death.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">When the apostles learned about this, they escaped to the region of Lyconia, to the cities of Lystra and Derbe and the nearby villages.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">And they continued to preach the hope of the gospel.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">In Lystra, Paul and Barnabas encountered a man who from birth had never walked, for he was crippled in his feet.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">He listened carefully to Paul as he preached. All of a sudden, Paul discerned that this man had faith in his heart to be healed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">So he shouted, &amp;apos;You! In the name of our Lord Jesus, stand up on your feet!&amp;apos; The man instantly jumped to his feet, stood for the first time in his life, and walked!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">When the crowds saw the miracle Paul had done, they shouted in their own language, &amp;apos;The gods have come down to us as men!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">They addressed Barnabas as &amp;apos;Zeus&amp;apos; and Paul as &amp;apos;Hermes,&amp;apos; because he was the spokesman.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Now, outside of the city stood the temple of Zeus. The priest of the temple, in order to honor Paul and Barnabas, brought bulls with wreaths of flowers draped on them to the gates of the courtyard where they were staying. The crowds clamored to offer them as sacrifices to the apostles. He even brought flower wreaths as crowns to place on their heads.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">When the apostles understood what was happening, they were mortified and tore their clothes as a sign of dismay. They rushed into the crowd and shouted,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">&amp;apos;People, what are you doing? We&amp;quot;re only weak human beings like everyone else. This is why we&amp;quot;ve come to tell you the good news, so that you would turn away from these worthless myths and turn to the living God. He is the Creator of all things: the earth, the heavens, the sea, and everything they contain.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">In previous generations he allowed the nations to pursue their own ways,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">yet he has never left himself without clear evidence of his goodness. For he blesses us with rain from heaven and seasons of fruitful harvests, and he nourishes us with food to meet our needs. He satisfies our lives, and euphoria fills our hearts.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Even after saying these things, they were barely able to restrain the people from offering sacrifices to them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Some of the Jews who had opposed Paul and Barnabas in Antioch and Iconium arrived and stirred up the crowd against them. They stoned Paul and dragged his body outside the city and left him for dead.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">When the believers encircled Paul&amp;quot;s body, he miraculously stood up! Paul stood and immediately went back into the city. The next day he left with Barnabas for Derbe.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">After preaching the wonderful news of the gospel there and winning a large number of followers to Jesus, they retraced their steps and revisited Lystra, Iconium, and Antioch.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">At each place they went, they strengthened the lives of the believers and encouraged them to go deeper in their faith. And they taught them, &amp;apos;It is necessary for us to enter into the realm of God&amp;quot;s kingdom, because that&amp;quot;s the only way we will endure our many trials and persecutions.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">Paul and Barnabas ordained leaders, known as elders, from among the congregations in every church they visited. After prayer and fasting, they publicly committed them into the care and protection of the Lord of their faith.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">After passing through different regions of central Turkey,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">they went to the city of Perga, preaching the life-giving message of the Lord. Afterward they journeyed down to the coast at Antalya,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">and from there they sailed back to Antioch. With their mission complete, they returned to the church where they had originally been sent out as missionaries, for it was in Antioch where they had been handed over to God&amp;quot;s powerful grace.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">When they arrived in Antioch, they gathered the church together and shared with them all of the wonderful works God had done through them and how God had opened the door of faith for the non-Jews to enter in.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">Afterward, Paul and Barnabas stayed there for a long time in fellowship with the believers.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="15">
			<VERS vnumber="1">While Paul and Barnabas were in Antioch, some false teachers came from Judea to trouble the believers. They taught, &amp;apos;Unless you are circumcised, as the law of Moses requires, you cannot be saved.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">This sparked a fierce argument between the false teachers and Paul and Barnabas. So the church appointed a delegation of believers, including Paul and Barnabas, to go to Jerusalem to meet with the apostles and elders of the church and resolve this issue.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">So the church sent them on their way. As they passed through Lebanon and Samaria, they stopped to share with the believers how God was converting many from among the non-Jewish people. Hearing this report brought great joy to all the churches. &amp;apos;Greetings from the apostles and pastors, and from your fellow believers&amp;ndash;to our non-Jewish brothers and sisters living in Antioch in Syria and the nearby regions.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">When they finally arrived in Jerusalem, Paul and Barnabas were welcomed by the church, the apostles, and the elders. They explained to them everything God had done among them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">But some of the believers who were of the religious group called &amp;apos;separated ones&amp;apos; were insistent, saying, &amp;apos;We must continue the custom of circumcision and require that the people keep the law of Moses.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">So the apostles and elders met privately to discuss the matter further.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">After a lengthy debate, Peter rose to his feet and said to them, &amp;apos;Brothers, you know how God has chosen me from the beginning to preach the wonderful news of the gospel to the non-Jewish nations.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">God, who knows the hearts of every person, confirmed this when he gave them the Holy Spirit, just like he has given the Spirit to us.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">So now, not one thing separates us as Jews and gentiles, for when they believe he makes their hearts pure.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">So why on earth would you now limit God&amp;quot;s grace by placing a yoke of religious duties on the shoulders of the believers that neither we nor our ancestors have been able to bear?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Don&amp;quot;t you believe that we are introduced to eternal life through the grace of our Lord Jesus&amp;ndash;the same grace that has brought these people new life?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Everyone became silent and listened carefully as Paul and Barnabas shared with the council at length about the signs and wonders and miracles God had worked through them while ministering to the non-Jewish people.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">When they had finished, Jacob took the floor and said, &amp;apos;Ladies and gentlemen, listen.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Peter has explained thoroughly that God has determined to win a people for himself from among the non-Jewish nations.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">And the prophet&amp;quot;s words are fulfilled:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">&amp;quot;After these things I will return to you and raise up the tabernacle of David that has fallen into ruin. I will restore and rebuild what David experienced including the gentiles whom I have called to be my very own,&amp;quot; says the Lord. After the believers prayed for them, asking for the Lord&amp;quot;s favor on their ministry, they left</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">so that all of humanity will be able to encounter the Lord</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">&amp;quot;For I have made known my works from eternity!&amp;quot;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">&amp;apos;So, in my judgment, we should not add any unnecessary burden upon the non-Jewish converts who are turning to God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">We will go to them as apostles and teach them to be set free from offering sacrifices to idols, sexual immorality, and eating anything strangled or with any blood.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">For many generations these words of Moses have been proclaimed every Sabbath day in the synagogues.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">The apostles and elders and the church of Jerusalem chose delegates to go to Antioch in Syria. They chose Judas, called Barsabbas, and Silas, both leaders in the church, to accompany Paul and Barnabas.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">They sent with them this letter:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">&amp;apos;We are aware that some have come to you from the church of Jerusalem. These men were not sent by us, but came with false teachings that have brought confusion and division, telling you to keep the law and be circumcised&amp;ndash;things we never commanded them to teach.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">&amp;apos;For it pleases the Holy Spirit and us that we not place any unnecessary burden on you, except for the following restrictions:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">Stay away from anything sacrificed to a pagan idol, from eating what is strangled or with any blood, and from any form of sexual immorality. You will be beautiful believers if you keep your souls from these things, and you will be true and faithful to our Lord Jesus. May God bless you!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">They sent the four men off for Antioch, and after gathering the regional church together, they delivered the letter.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">When the people heard the letter read out loud, they were overjoyed and delighted by its encouraging message.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">Then Judas and Silas, who were both prophets, spoke to them affirming words that strengthened the believers.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">After the four men spent some time there, the church sent them off in peace to return to the apostles in Jerusalem.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">After some days, Paul said to Barnabas, &amp;apos;Let&amp;quot;s travel to the regions where we&amp;quot;ve preached the word of God and see how the believers are getting along.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">Barnabas wished to take Mark (also known as John) along with them,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">but Paul disagreed. He didn&amp;quot;t think it was proper to take the one who had deserted them in south-central Turkey, leaving them to do their missionary work without him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">It became a heated argument between them, a disagreement so sharp that they parted from each other. Barnabas took Mark and sailed to Cyprus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">And Paul chose Silas as his partner.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">for Syria and southeast Turkey. Every place they went, they left the church stronger and more encouraged than before.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="16">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Paul and Silas came to the city of Derbe and then went on to Lystra, the hometown of a believer named Timothy. His mother was a Jewish follower of Jesus, but his father was not a Jew.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Timothy was well known and highly respected among all the believers of Lystra and Iconium.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Paul recognized God&amp;quot;s favor on Timothy&amp;quot;s life and wanted him to accompany them in ministry, but Paul had Timothy circumcised first because of the significant Jewish community living in the region, and everyone knew that Timothy&amp;quot;s father wasn&amp;quot;t a Jew.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">They went out together as missionaries, traveling to different cities where they preached and informed the churches of the decrees of the apostolic council of Jerusalem for the non-Jewish converts to observe.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">All the churches were growing daily and were encouraged and strengthened in their faith.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">The Holy Spirit had forbidden Paul and his partners to preach the word in the southwestern provinces of Turkey, so they ministered throughout the region of central and west-central Turkey.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">When they got as far west as the borders of Mysia, they repeatedly attempted to go north into the province of Bithynia, but again the Spirit of Jesus would not allow them to enter.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">So instead they went right on through the province of Mysia to the seaport of Troas.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">While staying there Paul experienced a supernatural, ecstatic vision during the night. A man from Macedonia appeared before him, pleading with him, &amp;apos;You must come across the sea to Macedonia and help us!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">After Paul had this vision, we immediately prepared to cross over to Macedonia, convinced that God himself was calling us to go and preach the wonderful news of the gospel to them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">From Troas we sailed a straight course to the island of Samothrace, and the next day to Neapolis.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Finally we reached Philippi, a major city in the Roman colony of Macedonia, and we remained there for a number of days.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">When the Sabbath day came, we went outside the gates of the city to the nearby river, for there appeared to be a house of prayer and worship there. Sitting on the riverbank we struck up a conversation with some of the women who had gathered there.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">One of them was Lydia, a businesswoman from the city of Thyatira who was a dealer of exquisite purple cloth and a Jewish convert. While Paul shared the good news with her, God opened her heart to receive Paul&amp;quot;s message.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">She devoted herself to the Lord, and we baptized her and her entire family. Afterward she urged us to stay in her home, saying, &amp;apos;Since I am now a believer in the Lord, come and stay in my house.&amp;apos; So we were persuaded to stay there.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">One day, as we were going to the house of prayer, we encountered a young slave girl who had an evil spirit of divination, the spirit of Python. She had earned great profits for her owners by being a fortune-teller.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">She kept following us, shouting, &amp;apos;These men are servants of the Great High God, and they&amp;quot;re telling us how to be saved!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Day after day she continued to do this, until Paul, greatly annoyed, turned and said to the spirit indwelling her, &amp;apos;I command you in the name of Jesus, the Anointed One, to come out of her, now!&amp;apos; At that very moment, the spirit came out of her!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">When her owners realized that their potential of making profit had vanished, they forcefully seized Paul and Silas and dragged them off to the city square to face the authorities.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">When they appeared before the Roman soldiers and magistrates, the slave owners leveled accusations against them, saying, &amp;apos;These Jews are troublemakers. They&amp;quot;re throwing our city into confusion.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">They&amp;quot;re pushing their Jewish religion down our throats. It&amp;quot;s wrong and unlawful for them to promote these Jewish ways, for we are Romans living in a Roman colony.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">A great crowd gathered, and all the people joined in to come against them. The Roman officials ordered that Paul and Silas be stripped of their garments and beaten with rods on their bare backs.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">After they were severely beaten, they were thrown into prison and the jailer was commanded to guard them securely.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">So the jailer placed them in the innermost cell of the prison and had their feet bound and chained.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">Paul and Silas, undaunted, prayed in the middle of the night and sang songs of praise to God, while all the other prisoners listened to their worship.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">Suddenly, a great earthquake shook the foundations of the prison. All at once every prison door flung open and the chains of all the prisoners came loose.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">Startled, the jailer awoke and saw every cell door standing open. Assuming that all the prisoners had escaped, he drew his sword and was about to kill himself</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">when Paul shouted in the darkness, &amp;apos;Stop! Don&amp;quot;t hurt yourself. We&amp;quot;re all still here.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">The jailer called for a light. When he saw that they were still in their cells, he rushed in and fell trembling at their feet.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">Then he led Paul and Silas outside and asked, &amp;apos;What must I do to be saved?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">They answered, &amp;apos;Believe in the Lord Jesus and you will be saved&amp;ndash;you and all your family.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">Then they prophesied the word of the Lord over him and all his family.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">Even though the hour was late, he washed their wounds. Then he and all his family were baptized. He took Paul and Silas into his home and set them at his table and fed them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">The jailer and all his family were filled with joy in their newfound faith in God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">At daybreak, the magistrates sent officers to the prison with orders to tell the jailer, &amp;apos;Let those two men go.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">The jailer informed Paul and Silas, &amp;apos;The magistrates have sent orders to release you. So you&amp;quot;re free to go now.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">But Paul told the officers, &amp;apos;Look, they had us beaten in public, without a fair trial&amp;ndash;and we are Roman citizens. Do you think we&amp;quot;re just going to quietly walk away after they threw us in prison and violated all of our rights? Absolutely not! You go back and tell the magistrates that they need to come down here themselves and escort us out!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">When the officers went back and reported what Paul and Silas had told them, the magistrates were frightened, especially upon hearing that they had beaten two Roman citizens without due process.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">So they went to the prison and apologized to Paul and Silas, begging them repeatedly, saying, &amp;apos;Please leave our city.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">So Paul and Silas left the prison and went back to Lydia&amp;quot;s house, where they met with the believers and comforted and encouraged them before departing.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="17">
			<VERS vnumber="1">After passing through the cities of Amphipolis and Apollonia, Paul and Silas arrived at Thessalonica.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">As they customarily did, they went to the synagogue to speak to the Jews from the Torah scrolls. For three weeks</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Paul challenged them by explaining the truth and proving to them the reality of the gospel&amp;ndash;that the Messiah had to suffer and die, then rise again from among the dead. He made it clear to them, saying, &amp;apos;I come to announce to you that Jesus is the Anointed One, the Messiah!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Some of the Jews were convinced that their message was true, so they joined Paul and Silas, along with quite a few prominent women and a large number of Greeks who worshiped God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">But many of the Jews were motivated by bitter jealousy and formed a large mob out of the troublemakers, unsavory characters, and street gangs to incite a riot. They set out to attack Jason&amp;quot;s house, for he had welcomed the apostles into his home. The mob was after Paul and Silas and sought to take them by force and bring them out to the people.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">When they couldn&amp;quot;t find them, they took Jason instead, along with some of the brothers in his house church , and dragged them before the city council. Along the way they screamed out, &amp;apos;Those troublemakers who have turned the world upside down have come here to our city.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">And now Jason and these men have welcomed them as guests. They&amp;quot;re traitors to Caesar, teaching that there is another king named Jesus.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Their angry shouts stirred up the crowds and troubled the city and all its officials.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">So when Paul and Silas came before the leaders of the city , they refused to let them go until Jason and his men posted bail.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">That night the believers sent Paul and Silas off to the city of Berea, where they once again went into the synagogue.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">They found that the Jews of Berea were of more noble character and much more open minded than those of Thessalonica. They were hungry to learn and eagerly received the word. Every day they opened the scrolls of Scripture to search and examine them, to verify that what Paul taught them was true.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">A large number of Jews became believers in Jesus , along with quite a few influential Greek women and men.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">When the news reached the Jews in Thessalonica that Paul was now in Berea, preaching the word of God, the troublemakers went there too and they agitated and stirred up the crowds against him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">The fellow believers helped Paul slip away to the coast of the Aegean Sea, while Silas and Timothy remained in Berea.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Those who accompanied Paul sailed with him as far as Athens. Then Paul sent them back to Berea with instructions for Silas and Timothy to hurry and join him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">While Paul was waiting for them in Athens, his spirit was deeply troubled when he realized that the entire city was full of idols.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">He argued the claims of the gospel with the Jews in their synagogue, and with those who were worshipers of God, and every day he preached in the public square to whomever would listen.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Philosophers of the teachings of Epicurus, and others called Stoics, debated with Paul. When they heard him speak about Jesus and his resurrection, they said, &amp;apos;What strange ideas is this babbler trying to present?&amp;apos; Others said, &amp;apos;He&amp;quot;s peddling some kind of foreign religion.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">So they brought him for a public dialogue before the leadership council of Athens, known as the Areopagus. &amp;apos;Tell us,&amp;apos; they said, &amp;apos;about this new teaching that you&amp;quot;re bringing to our city.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">You&amp;quot;re presenting strange and astonishing things to our ears, and we want to know what it all means.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Now, it was the favorite pastime of the Athenians and visitors to Athens to discuss the newest ideas and philosophies.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">So Paul stood in the middle of the leadership council and said, &amp;apos;Respected leaders of Athens, it is clear to me how extravagant you are in your worship of idols.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">For as I walked through your city, I was captivated by the many shrines and objects of your worship. I even found an inscription on one altar that read, &amp;quot;To the Unknown God.&amp;quot; I have come to introduce to you this God whom you worship without even knowing anything about him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">&amp;apos;The true God is the Creator of all things. He is the owner and Lord of the heavenly realm and the earthly realm, and he doesn&amp;quot;t live in man-made temples.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">He supplies life and breath and all things to every living being. He doesn&amp;quot;t lack a thing that we mortals could supply for him, for he has all things and everything he needs.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">From one man, Adam, he made every man and woman and every race of humanity, and he spread us over all the earth. He sets the boundaries of people and nations, determining their appointed times in history.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">He has done this so that every person would long for God, feel their way to him, and find him&amp;ndash;for he is the God who is easy to discover!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">It is through him that we live and function and have our identity; just as your own poets have said, &amp;quot;Our lineage comes from him.&amp;quot;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">&amp;apos;Since our lineage can be traced back to God, how could we even think that the divine image could be compared to something made of gold, silver, or stone, sculpted by man&amp;quot;s artwork and clever imagination?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">&amp;apos;In the past God tolerated our ignorance of these things, but now the time of deception has passed away. He commands us all to repent and turn to God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">For the appointed day has risen, in which he is going to judge the world in righteousness by the man he has designated. And the proof given to the world that God has chosen this man is this: he resurrected him from among the dead!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">The moment they heard Paul bring up the topic of resurrection, some of them ridiculed him, then got up and left . But others said, &amp;apos;We want to hear you again later about these things.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">So Paul left the meeting.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">But there were some who believed the message and joined him from that day forward. Among them were Dionysius, a judge on the leadership council, and a woman named Damaris.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="18">
			<VERS vnumber="1">When Paul left Athens he traveled to Corinth,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">where he met a Jewish man named Aquila, who was originally from northeastern Turkey. He and his wife, Priscilla, had recently emigrated from Italy to Corinth because Emperor Claudius had expelled all the Jews from Rome.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Since Paul and Aquila were both tentmakers by trade, Paul moved in with them and they became business partners.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Every Sabbath day Paul spoke openly in the synagogue, to both Jews and non-Jews, attempting to persuade them to believe the message of Jesus .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">When Silas and Timothy finally arrived from Macedonia, Paul spent all his time preaching the word of God, trying to convince the Jews that Jesus was the Messiah.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">When they viciously slandered him and hurled abuse on him, he symbolically shook the dust off his clothes in protest against them. He said to them, &amp;apos;Have it your way then! I am guiltless as to your fate, for the blood-guilt of your actions will be on your own heads, and from now on I will preach to the non-Jews.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Leaving the synagogue, Paul went to the home of Titus, a convert to Judaism, for he and his family attended the Jewish meetings and they had all become believers in Jesus .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Crispus, the leader of the synagogue, believed in the Lord, together with his entire family, and many of the Corinthians who heard what had happened believed in the Lord and were baptized.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">One night, the Lord spoke to Paul in a supernatural vision and said, &amp;apos;Don&amp;quot;t ever be afraid. Speak the words that I give you and don&amp;quot;t be intimidated,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">because I am with you. No one will be able to hurt you, for there are many in this city whom I call my own.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">For the next year and a half, Paul stayed in Corinth, faithfully teaching the word of God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Now, at that time, Gallio was the regional governor who ruled over the Roman province of Achaia, and the Jews turned against Paul and came together to seize him and bring him publicly before the governor&amp;quot;s court.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">They accused him before Gallio, saying, &amp;apos;This man is creating a disturbance by persuading people to worship God in ways that are contrary to our laws.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Just as Paul was about to speak in his defense, Gallio interrupted and said, &amp;apos;Wait! If this involved some major crime or fraud, it would be my responsibility to hear the case.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">But this is nothing more than a disagreement among yourselves over semantics and personalities and traditions of your own Jewish laws. Go and settle it yourselves! I refuse to be the judge of these issues.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">So Gallio dismissed them from the court.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Immediately the crowd turned on Sosthenes, one of the leaders of the synagogue who sided with Paul . They seized him and beat him up right there in the courtroom! But Gallio showed no concern at all over what was happening.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">After remaining in Corinth several more days, Paul finally bid shalom to the believers and sailed away for the coast of Syria, accompanied by Priscilla and Aquila. Before they left, Paul had his head shaved at Cenchrea, because he had taken a vow of dedication.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">When they reached Ephesus, Paul left Priscilla and Aquila behind, then he went into the synagogue and spoke to the Jews.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">They asked him to stay longer, but he refused</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">and said farewell to them, adding, &amp;apos;I will come back to you, if it is God&amp;quot;s will, after I go to Jerusalem to observe the feast.&amp;apos; Then he set sail from Ephesus for Caesarea.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">When he arrived there he traveled on to Jerusalem to visit the church and pray for them, then he left for Antioch.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">After spending some time there, Paul continued on through the region of Galatia and Phyrgia in central Turkey. And wherever he went he encouraged and strengthened the believers.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">A Jewish man by the name of Apollos arrived in Ephesus. He was a native of Alexandria and was recognized as an educated and cultured man. He was powerful in the Scriptures,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">had accepted Jesus, and had been taught about the Lord. He was spiritually passionate for Jesus and a convincing teacher, although he only knew about the baptism of John.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">He fearlessly preached in the synagogue. But when Priscilla and Aquila heard Apollos&amp;quot; teachings, they met with him privately and revealed to him the ways of God more completely.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">Then Apollos, with the encouragement of the believers, went to the province of Achaia. He took a letter of recommendation from the brothers of Ephesus so his ministry would be welcomed in the region. He was a tremendous help to the believers and caused them to increase in grace.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">Apollos boldly and publicly confronted the Jews, vigorously debating them, proving undeniably from the Scriptures that Jesus was the Messiah.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="19">
			<VERS vnumber="1">While Apollos was ministering in Corinth, Paul traveled on through the regions of Turkey until he arrived in Ephesus, where he found a group of twelve followers of Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">The first thing he asked them was &amp;apos;Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you became believers?&amp;apos; &amp;apos;No,&amp;apos; they replied. &amp;apos;We&amp;quot;ve not even heard of a holy spirit.&amp;apos; They responded, &amp;apos;It meant that we would follow John&amp;quot;s teaching.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Paul asked, &amp;apos;Then what was the meaning of your baptism?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Paul said, &amp;apos;John&amp;quot;s baptism was for those who were turning from their sins, and he taught you to believe in and follow the one who was coming after him: Jesus the Anointed One.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">When they understood this, they were baptized into the authority of Jesus, the Anointed One.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">For three months Paul taught openly and fearlessly in the synagogue, arguing persuasively for them to enter into God&amp;quot;s kingdom realm.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">But some of them hardened their hearts and stubbornly refused to believe. When they spoke evil of the Way in front of the congregation, Paul withdrew from them and took the believers with him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Every day for over two years, he taught them in the lecture hall of Tyrannus, which resulted in everyone living in the province of Asia, Jews and non-Jews, hearing the prophetic word of the Lord.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">God kept releasing a flow of extraordinary miracles through the hands of Paul.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Because of this, people took Paul&amp;quot;s handkerchiefs and articles of clothing, even pieces of cloth that had touched his skin, laying them on the bodies of the sick, and diseases and demons left them and they were healed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">One day, when they said those words, the demon in the man replied, &amp;apos;I know about Jesus, and I recognize Paul, but who do you think you are?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Then the demonized man jumped on them and threw them to the ground, beating them mercilessly. He overpowered the seven exorcists until they all ran out of the house naked and badly bruised.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">All of the people in Ephesus were awestruck, both Jews and non-Jews, when they heard about what had happened. Great fear fell over the entire city, and the authority of the name of Jesus was exalted.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Many believers publicly confessed their sins and disclosed their secrets.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Large numbers of those who had been practicing magic took all of their books and scrolls of spells and incantations and publicly burned them. When the value of all the books and scrolls was calculated, it all came to several million dollars.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">The power of God caused the word to spread, and the people were greatly impacted.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Paul had it in his heart to go to Jerusalem and, on his way there, to revisit the places in Greece where he had ministered. &amp;apos;After that,&amp;apos; he said, &amp;apos;I have to go to Rome also.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">So he sent ahead into Macedonia two of his ministry assistants, Timothy and Erastus, while he remained in western Turkey.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">At that time a major disturbance erupted in Ephesus over the people following God&amp;quot;s way.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">It began with a wealthy man named Demetrius, who had built a large business and enriched many craftsmen by manufacturing silver shrines for the Greek goddess Artemis.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">Our businesses are in danger of being discredited. And not only that, but the temple of our great goddess Artemis is being dishonored and seen as worthless. She is the goddess of all of western Turkey and is worshiped in all the world. But if this outrage continues, everyone everywhere will suffer the loss of her magnificent greatness.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">When the people heard this, they were filled with boiling rage. They shouted over and over, &amp;apos;Artemis, the great goddess of the Ephesians!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">The entire city was thrown into chaos as everyone rushed into the stadium together, dragging with them Gaius and Aristarchus, Paul&amp;quot;s traveling companions from Macedonia.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">When Paul attempted to go in and speak to the massive crowd, the disciples wouldn&amp;quot;t let him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">Some of the high-ranking governmental officials of the region, because they loved him, sent Paul an urgent message, saying, &amp;apos;Whatever you do, don&amp;quot;t step foot into that stadium!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">The frenzied crowd shouted out one thing, and others shouted something else, until they were all in mass confusion, with many not even knowing why they were there!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">Some of the Jews pushed forward a Jewish man named Alexander to be their spokesman, and different factions of the crowd shouted instructions at him. He stood before the people and motioned for everyone to be quiet so he could be heard.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">But when he began to speak, they realized that he was a Jew, so they shouted him down. For nearly two hours they shouted over and over, &amp;apos;Great is Artemis, the goddess of the Ephesians!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">Eventually the mayor of the city was able to quiet them down. He said, &amp;apos;Fellow citizens! Who in the world doesn&amp;quot;t know that we are devoted to the great temple of Artemis and to her image that fell from Zeus out of heaven?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">Since no one can deny it, you should all just be quiet. Calm down and don&amp;quot;t do anything hasty.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">For you have brought these men before us who aren&amp;quot;t guilty of any crime. They are neither temple robbers nor blasphemers of our goddess.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">So if Demetrius and the men of his trade have a case against someone, the courts are open. They can appear before the judge and press charges.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">But if you&amp;quot;re looking for anything further to bring up, it must be argued before the court and settled there, not here.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">Don&amp;quot;t you realize we&amp;quot;re putting our city in danger of being accused of a riot by the Roman authorities? There&amp;quot;s no good explanation we can give them for all this commotion!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">After he had said this, he dispersed the crowds and sent them away.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="20">
			<VERS vnumber="1">When the uproar finally died down, Paul gathered the believers and encouraged their hearts. He kissed them, said good-bye, and left for Macedonia.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">At every place he passed through, he brought words of great comfort and encouragement to the believers. Then he went on to Greece</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">and stayed there for three months. Just as Paul was about to sail for Syria, he learned of a plot against him by the Jews, so he decided to return by going through Macedonia. Then they tearfully accompanied Paul back to the ship.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Seven men accompanied him as far as western Turkey. They were Sopater, son of Pyrrhus from Berea, Aristarchus and Secundus from Thessalonica, Gaius from Derbe, and Timothy, Tychicus, and Trophimus from western Turkey.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">These men went ahead and were waiting for us at Troas.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">As soon as all of the Passover celebrations were over, we sailed from Philippi. After five days we joined the others in Troas, where we stayed another week.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">On Sunday we gathered to take communion and to hear Paul preach. Because he was planning to leave the next day, he continued speaking until past midnight.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">There were many flickering lights in the upstairs chamber where we were meeting.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Sitting in an open window listening was a young man named Eutychus. As Paul&amp;quot;s sermon dragged on, Eutychus became drowsy and fell into a deep slumber. Sound asleep, he fell three stories to his death below.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Paul went downstairs, bent over the boy, and embraced him. Taking him in his arms, he said to all the people gathered, &amp;apos;Stop your worrying. He&amp;quot;s come back to life!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Paul went back upstairs, served communion, and ate a meal with them. Then he picked back up where he left off and taught until dawn.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Filled with enormous joy, they took the boy home alive and everyone was encouraged.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Continuing our journey, we made our way to the ship and sailed for Assos. Paul had previously arranged to meet us there as he traveled overland by foot.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">So he rejoined our team there and we took him aboard and sailed for Mitylene.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">The next day we crossed over to Chios, and the following day we arrived at the island of Samos. We stayed at Trogyllium, and on the day after that we reached Miletus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Paul was in a hurry to arrive in Jerusalem, hoping to make it in time for the Feast of Pentecost, so he decided to bypass Ephesus and not spend any time in that region.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">However, from Miletus Paul had sent a message to the elders of the church in Ephesus and asked them to come meet with him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">When they arrived, he said to them, &amp;apos;All of you know how I&amp;quot;ve lived and conducted myself while I was with you. From the first day I set foot in western Turkey</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">I&amp;quot;ve operated in God&amp;quot;s miracle power with great humility and served you with many tears. I&amp;quot;ve endured numerous ordeals because of the plots of the Jews.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">You know how I&amp;quot;ve taught you in public meetings and in your homes, and that I&amp;quot;ve not held anything back from you that would help you grow.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">I urged both Jews and non-Jews to turn from sin to God and to have faith in our Lord Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">And now I am captive to the Holy Spirit to go to Jerusalem, without really knowing what will happen to me there.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">Yet I know that the Holy Spirit warns me in town after town, saying, &amp;quot;Chains and afflictions are prepared for you.&amp;quot;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">&amp;apos;But whether I live or die is not important, for I don&amp;quot;t esteem my life as indispensable. It&amp;quot;s more important for me to fulfill my destiny and to finish the ministry my Lord Jesus has assigned to me, which is to faithfully preach the wonderful news of God&amp;quot;s grace.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">I&amp;quot;ve been a part of your lives and shared with you many times the message of God&amp;quot;s kingdom realm. But now I leave you, and you will not see my face again.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">If any of you should be lost, I will not be blamed, for my conscience is clean,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">because I&amp;quot;ve taught you everything I could about God&amp;quot;s eternal plan and I&amp;quot;ve held nothing back.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">So guard your hearts. Be true shepherds over all the flock and feed them well. Remember, it was the Holy Spirit who appointed you to guard and oversee the churches that belong to Jesus, the Anointed One, which he purchased and established by his own blood.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">&amp;apos;I know that after I leave, imposters who have no loyalty to the flock will come among you like savage wolves.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">Even some from among your very own ranks will rise up, twisting the truth to seduce people into following them instead of Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">So be alert and discerning. Remember that for three years, night and day, I&amp;quot;ve never stopped warning each of you, pouring out my heart to you with tears.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">&amp;apos;And so now, I entrust you into God&amp;quot;s hands and the message of his grace, which is all that you need to become strong. All of God&amp;quot;s blessings are imparted through the message of his grace, which he provides as the spiritual inheritance given to all of his holy ones.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">&amp;apos;I haven&amp;quot;t been after your money or any of your possessions.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">You all know that I&amp;quot;ve worked with my hands to meet my own needs and the needs of those who&amp;quot;ve served with me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">I&amp;quot;ve left you an example of how you should serve and take care of those who are weak. For we must always cherish the words of our Lord Jesus, who taught, &amp;quot;Giving brings a far greater blessing than receiving.&amp;quot; &amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">After Paul finished speaking, he knelt down and prayed with them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">Then they all cried with great weeping as one after another hugged Paul and kissed him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">What broke their hearts the most were his words &amp;apos;You will not see my face again.&amp;apos;</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="21">
			<VERS vnumber="1">After we tore ourselves away from them, we put out to sea and sailed a direct course for the island of Kos, and on the next day to the island of Rhodes, and from there to Patara.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">There we found a ship that was crossing over to Syria, so we went aboard and sailed away.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">After we sighted Cyprus and sailed south of it, we docked at Tyre in Syria, where the ship unloaded its cargo.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">When we went ashore we found a number of believers and stayed with them for a week. They prophesied to Paul repeatedly , warning him by the Holy Spirit not to set foot in Jerusalem.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">When it was time for us to leave and be on our way, everyone&amp;ndash;men, women, and children&amp;ndash;accompanied us out of the city down to the beach. After we all knelt in the sand and prayed together,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">we kissed one another, said our good-byes, and boarded the ship, while the believers went back to their homes.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">From Tyre we sailed on to the town of Akko and greeted the believers there with peace. We stayed with them for a day.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Then we went on to Caesarea and stayed for several days in the home of Philip the evangelist, who was one of the seven deacons and</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">the father of four unmarried daughters who prophesied.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">During our stay of several days, Agabus, a prophet from Judea, came to visit us.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">As a prophetic gesture , he took Paul&amp;quot;s belt and tied his own hands and feet with it as he prophesied, &amp;apos;The Holy Spirit says, &amp;quot;The one who owns this belt will be tied up in this same way by the Jews and they will hand him over to those who are not Jews.&amp;quot; &amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">When we heard this, both we and the believers of Caesarea begged Paul not to go on to Jerusalem.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">But Paul replied, &amp;apos;Why do you cry and break my heart with your tears? Don&amp;quot;t you know that I&amp;quot;m prepared not only to be imprisoned but to die in Jerusalem for the sake of the wonder of the name of our Lord Jesus?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Because we couldn&amp;quot;t persuade him, we gave up and said nothing more except &amp;apos;May the will of the Lord be done.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Afterward we packed our bags and set off for Jerusalem,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">with some of the believers from Caesarea accompanying us. They brought us to a village where they introduced us to Mnason, a Cypriot, one of the original disciples, and he offered us hospitality.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">When we finally arrived in Jerusalem, the believers welcomed us with delight.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">The next day Paul and our team had a meeting with Jacob and all the elders of the Jerusalem church.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">After greeting everyone, Paul explained in detail what God had accomplished through his ministry among the non-Jewish people.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">When they heard Paul&amp;quot;s report, they praised God. And they said to him, &amp;apos;You should know, brother, that there are many tens of thousands of Jews who have also embraced the faith and are passionately keeping the law of Moses.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">But they&amp;quot;ve heard a rumor that you&amp;quot;ve been instructing the Jews everywhere to abandon Moses by telling them they don&amp;quot;t need to circumcise their children or keep our Jewish customs.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">They will certainly hear that you&amp;quot;ve come to Jerusalem. So what is the proper way to proceed?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">We urge you to follow our suggestion. We have four men here who have taken a vow and are ready to have their heads shaved.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">Now go with them to the temple and sponsor them in their purification ceremony, and pay all their required expenses. Then everyone will know that the rumors they&amp;quot;ve heard are false. They&amp;quot;ll see that you are one who lives according to the law of Moses.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">But in reference to the non-Jewish believers, we&amp;quot;ve sent them a letter with our decision, stating that they should avoid eating meat that has been offered to an idol, or eating blood or any animal that has been strangled, and to avoid sexual immorality.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">The next day, Paul took the four men to the temple and ceremonially purified himself along with them. He publicly gave notice of the date when their vows would end and when sacrifices would be offered for each of them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">When the seven-day period was almost over, a number of Jews from western Turkey who had seen him in the temple courts stirred up the whole crowd against him. Seizing him,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">they shouted, &amp;apos;Men of Israel, help us! This is the man who teaches everywhere what is contrary to our nation, our law, and this temple. And not only that, but now he brings these non-Jewish men with him into the inner courts of our temple! They have made this sacred place ritually unclean.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">(For Trophimus, an Ephesian, had been seen previously with him, and they assumed that he entered the inner courts with Paul.)</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">This ignited a huge riot in the city as all the people came together to seize Paul and drag him out of the temple courts, closing the gates behind him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">But as they were about to kill Paul, the news reached the commander of the Roman garrison that the entire city was in an uproar.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">He immediately ran out to the crowd with a large number of his officers and soldiers. When the crowd saw them coming, they stopped beating Paul.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">The commander arrested him and ordered that he be bound with two chains. He then asked, &amp;apos;Who is he and what has he done wrong?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">Some in the crowd shouted one thing and others something else, just adding to the confusion. Since the commander was unable to get to the truth because of the disturbance, he ordered that Paul be brought back to their headquarters.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">When they reached the steps leading up to the fortress, they had to protect Paul and carry him up because of the violent mob following them,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">and everyone was screaming out, &amp;apos;Away with this man! Kill him!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">As Paul was being led to the entrance of the compound, he said to the commander in Greek, &amp;apos;May I have a word with you?&amp;apos; The commander replied, &amp;apos;So you know Greek, do you?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">Aren&amp;quot;t you that Egyptian fanatic who started a rebellion some time ago and led four thousand assassins out into the wilderness?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">Paul answered, &amp;apos;I am, in fact, a Jew from Tarsus, in Cilicia, a well-known city of southern Turkey where I was born. I beg you, sir, please give me a moment to speak to these people.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">When the commander gave his permission, Paul stood on the steps and gestured with his hands for the people to listen. When the crowd quieted down, Paul addressed them in Aramaic and said:</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="22">
			<VERS vnumber="1">&amp;apos;Ladies and gentlemen, fellow believers and elders &amp;ndash;please listen to me as I offer my defense.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">(Now, when everyone realized he was speaking to them in their Judean Aramaic language, the crowd became all the more attentive.)</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Then Paul said, &amp;apos;I am a Jewish man who was born in Tarsus, a city of Turkey. However, I grew up in this city and was properly trained in the Mosaic law and tutored by Rabbi Gamaliel according to our ancestral customs. I&amp;quot;ve been extremely passionate in my desire to please God, just as all of you are today.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">I&amp;quot;ve hunted down and killed the followers of this Way. I have seized them and thrown them into prison, both men and women.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">All of this can be verified by the high priest and the Supreme Council of Elders. For they even wrote letters to our fellow Jews of Damascus, authorizing me to arrest them and bring them back to Jerusalem as prisoners to be punished.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">&amp;apos;As I was on the road approaching Damascus, about noon, a brilliant heavenly light suddenly appeared, flashing all around me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">As I fell to the ground I heard a voice say, &amp;quot;Saul, Saul . . . why are you persecuting me?&amp;quot;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">&amp;apos;I answered, &amp;quot;Who are you, my Lord?&amp;quot; &amp;apos;He said to me, &amp;quot;I am Jesus, the Victorious. I am the one you are persecuting.&amp;quot;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">&amp;apos;Those who were with me saw the brilliant light, but they didn&amp;quot;t hear the voice of the one who spoke to me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">&amp;apos;So I asked, &amp;quot;Lord, what am I to do?&amp;quot; &amp;apos;And the Lord said to me, &amp;quot;Get up and go into Damascus, and there you will be told about all that you are destined to do.&amp;quot; &amp;apos;Yes I am,&amp;apos; he replied. Paul replied, &amp;apos;I was born as a citizen!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">&amp;apos;Because of the dazzling glory of the light, I couldn&amp;quot;t see&amp;ndash;I was left blind. So they had to lead me by the hand the rest of the way into Damascus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">&amp;apos;A Jewish man living there named Ananias came to see me. He was a godly man who lived according to the law of Moses and was highly esteemed by the Jewish community.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">He stood beside me and said, &amp;quot;Saul! My brother, Saul&amp;ndash;open your eyes and see again!&amp;quot; At that very instant I opened my eyes and I could see!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Then he said to me, &amp;quot;The God of our ancestors has destined you to know his plan and for you to see the Holy One and to hear his voice.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">For you will be his witness to every race of people and will share with them everything that you&amp;quot;ve seen and heard.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">So now, what are you waiting for? Get up, be baptized, and wash away your sins as you call upon his name.&amp;quot;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">&amp;apos;Then I returned to Jerusalem. And while I was praying in the temple, I entered another realm</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">and saw him. He said to me, &amp;quot;Hurry and depart from Jerusalem quickly, for the people here will not receive the truths you share about me.&amp;quot;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">&amp;apos; &amp;quot;But Lord,&amp;quot; I argued, &amp;quot;they all know that I&amp;quot;m the one who went into our Jewish meetings to find those who believe in you and had them beaten and imprisoned.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">When the blood of your witness Stephen was shed, I stood nearby in full approval of what was happening. I even guarded the cloaks of those who stoned him to death .&amp;quot;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">&amp;apos;Then he said to me, &amp;quot;Go at once, for I am sending you to preach to the non-Jewish nations.&amp;quot; &amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">The crowd listened attentively to Paul up to this point. But when they heard this, all at once they erupted with loud shouts, saying, &amp;apos;Get rid of this man! Kill him! He doesn&amp;quot;t deserve to live!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">While the crowd was screaming and yelling, removing their outer garments, and throwing handfuls of dust in the air in protest,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">the commander had Paul brought back into the compound. He ordered that he be whipped with a lash and interrogated to find out what he said that so infuriated the crowd.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">When the soldiers stretched Paul out with ropes, he said to the captain, who was standing nearby, &amp;apos;Is it legal for you to torture a Roman citizen like this, without a proper trial?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">When the officer heard this, he immediately went to his commander and reported it, saying, &amp;apos;This man is a Roman citizen. What should we do now?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">The commander came to Paul and asked him, &amp;apos;Tell me the truth, are you a Roman citizen?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">The commander said, &amp;apos;I had to purchase my citizenship with a great sum of money.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">All of the soldiers who were about to whip Paul backed away, because they were afraid of the consequences for tying up and holding a Roman citizen against his will.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">The next day the commander ordered that the high priest and the supreme Jewish council be convened, because he wanted to find out exactly why the Jews were accusing Paul. So he had him untied and brought out to stand before them all.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="23">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Paul fixed his eyes on the members of the council and said, &amp;apos;My brothers, up to this day I have lived my life before God with a perfectly clear conscience.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">At that moment, Ananias the high priest ordered those standing near Paul to strike him in the mouth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Paul responded, &amp;apos;God is going to strike you, you corrupt pretender! For you sit there judging me according to the law, yet you broke the law when you ordered me to be struck.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Those standing near Paul said to him, &amp;apos;Do you dare insult the high priest of God?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Paul answered, &amp;apos;I had no idea, brothers, that he was the high priest. For the Scriptures say, &amp;quot;Do not curse the ruler of your people.&amp;quot; &amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Just then Paul realized that part of the council were Sadducees, who deny the resurrection of the dead, and others were of the separated ones. So he shouted, &amp;apos;My fellow Jews, I am a separated one, and the son of a separated one. That&amp;quot;s why I&amp;quot;m on trial here. It&amp;quot;s because of the hope I have that the dead will rise to live again.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">When he said this, a heated argument started among them, dividing the council between the Sadducees and the separated ones.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Paul knew that the Sadducees teach there is no resurrection and do not believe in angels or spirits, but the separated ones believe in them all.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">This sparked an even greater uproar among them. Finally, some of the separated ones who were religious scholars stood up and protested strongly, saying, &amp;apos;We find nothing wrong with this man. It could be that the Spirit has spoken to him or an angel came to him.&amp;apos; Paul answered, &amp;apos;Southeast Turkey.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">When the shouting match became intense, the commander, fearing they would tear Paul to pieces, intervened and ordered his soldiers to go in to their meeting and seize him and take him back to their headquarters.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">That night our Lord appeared to Paul and stood before him and said, &amp;apos;Receive miracle power. For just as you have spoken for me in Jerusalem, you will also speak for me in Rome.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">They went to the high priest and the elders to divulge their plans and said to them, &amp;apos;We have united in a solemn oath not to eat or drink until Paul is dead.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">So we urge you to have the commander bring him to you as though you were to determine his case with a more thorough inquiry. And we will kill him before he even gets here!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">When Paul&amp;quot;s nephew, his sister&amp;quot;s son, overheard their plot to kill him, he came to the headquarters and informed him of their plans.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Paul called for one of the captains and said, &amp;apos;Take this boy to the commander, for he has something important to report to him.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">The captain took him to the commander and informed him, &amp;apos;Paul the prisoner asked me to bring this boy to you because he has something important for you to know.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">The commander took him by the arm and led him aside in private and asked him, &amp;apos;What do you have to tell me?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">He replied, &amp;apos;The Jews have plotted to kill Paul. Tomorrow they will ask you to bring him again to the supreme council under the pretense of wanting to question him further.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Don&amp;quot;t believe them, because they have forty men lying in wait to ambush Paul. These men have sworn an oath not to eat or drink until they have killed him. They&amp;quot;re all waiting for you to agree to their request so they can carry out their plot .&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">The commander dismissed Paul&amp;quot;s nephew after directing him, &amp;apos;Tell no one that you&amp;quot;ve reported these things to me.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">He sent with them a letter that read:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">From Claudias Lysias, to His Excellency, Governor Felix: Dear Governor, Sincerely, Claudius Lysias</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">I rescued this man, who was seized by the Jews as they were about to put him to death. I intervened with my troops because I understand that he is a Roman citizen.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">I was determined to learn exactly what charge they were accusing him of, so I brought him to stand before the Jewish supreme council.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">I discovered that he was being accused with reference to violating controversial issues about their law, but I found no charge against him that deserved death or imprisonment.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">When I was informed of an imminent plot to kill him, I sent him to you at once, and I have ordered his accusers to also come before you and state their charges against him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">The soldiers carried out their orders and escorted Paul during the night until they reached the city of Antipatris.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">The next day the horsemen continued on with Paul and the rest of the soldiers were dismissed to return to their headquarters.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">Upon their arrival in Caesarea, they presented the letter to the governor and brought Paul before him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">After reading the letter, he asked Paul what province he was from.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">The governor said, &amp;apos;I will give you a full hearing when your accusers arrive here also.&amp;apos; Then he ordered that Paul be kept under guard in Herod&amp;quot;s palace.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="24">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Five days later, Ananias the high priest arrived in Caesarea, accompanied by some Jewish elders and Tertullus, their prosecuting attorney. They were brought before the governor to present formal charges against Paul.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">After Paul was summoned, Tertullus accused him, saying,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">&amp;apos;Your Excellency Felix, under the shadow of your wise leadership we Jews have experienced a long period of peace. Because of your wise foresight, many reforms are coming to pass in our nation because of you, Most Honorable Felix. We deeply appreciate this and thank you very much.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">&amp;apos;So that I won&amp;quot;t weary you with a lengthy presentation, I beg you to hear our brief summary, with your customary graciousness.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">For we have found this man to be a contagious plague, a seditious man who continually stirs up riots among the Jews all over the world. He has become a ringleader of the sect known as the Nazarenes.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">He has even attempted to desecrate our temple, which is why we had him arrested. We sought to judge him according to our law,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">but Commander Lysias came with great force, snatched him away from our hands, and sent him here to you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">He has ordered his accusers to come to you so that you could interrogate him and ascertain for yourself that all these charges we are bringing against him are true.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">All the Jews present joined in the verbal attack, saying, &amp;apos;Yes, it&amp;quot;s true!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">The governor motioned that it was Paul&amp;quot;s turn to speak, so he began to answer the accusations. &amp;apos;Because I know that you have been a judge over this nation for many years, I gladly respond in my defense.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">You can easily verify that about twelve days ago, I went to Jerusalem to worship.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">No one found me arguing with anyone or causing trouble among the people in the synagogues or in the temple or anywhere in the city.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">They are completely unable to prove these accusations they make against me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">&amp;apos;But I do confess this to you: I worship the God of our Jewish ancestors as a follower of the Way, which they call a sect. For I believe everything that is written in the Law and the Prophets.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">And my hope is in God, the same hope that even my accusers have embraced, the hope of a resurrection from the dead of both the righteous and the unrighteous.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">That&amp;quot;s why I seek with all my heart to have a clean conscience toward God and toward others.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">&amp;apos;After being away from Jerusalem for several years, I returned to bring to my people gifts for the poor.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">I was in the temple, ritually purified and presenting my offering to God, when they seized me. I had no noisy crowd around me, and I wasn&amp;quot;t causing trouble or making any kind of disturbance whatsoever.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">It was a group of Jews from western Turkey who were being unruly; they are the ones who should be here now to bring their charges if they have anything against me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Or at least these men standing before you should clearly state what crime they found me guilty of when I stood before the Jewish supreme council,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">unless it&amp;quot;s the one thing I passionately spoke out when I stood among them. I am on trial today only because of my belief in the resurrection of the dead.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Felix, who was well acquainted with the facts about the Way, concluded the hearing with these words: &amp;apos;I will decide your case after Commander Lysias arrives.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">He then ordered the captain to keep Paul in protective custody, but to give him a measure of freedom, he allowed any of his friends to visit him and help take care of his needs.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">Several days later, Felix came back with his wife, Drusilla, who was Jewish. They sent for Paul and listened as he shared with them about faith in Jesus, the Anointed One.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">As Paul spoke about true righteousness, self-control, and the coming judgment, Felix became terrified and said, &amp;apos;Leave me for now. I&amp;quot;ll send for you later when it&amp;quot;s more convenient.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">He expected to receive a bribe from Paul for his release, so for that reason he would send for Paul from time to time to converse with him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">Two years later, Felix was succeeded by Porcius Festus. Before he left office he decided to leave Paul in prison as a political favor to the Jews.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="25">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Three days after Festus assumed his duties in Caesarea, he made the journey to Jerusalem.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Religious authorities and prominent leaders among the Jews brought formal charges against Paul before Festus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">They came asking him for a favor&amp;ndash;that he would transfer Paul from Caesarea to Jerusalem&amp;ndash;all the while plotting to ambush and kill Paul along the way.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Festus responded to their request by informing them that he planned to return to Caesarea shortly.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">He told them, &amp;apos;Your leaders can come with me to Caesarea. If this man has broken any laws, you can bring charges against him there.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">After Festus had stayed in Jerusalem no more than eight to ten days, he left for Caesarea. The day after he arrived, he convened the court and took his seat on the bench as judge over the proceedings. After he ordered Paul brought into the courtroom,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">the Jewish leaders who came from Jerusalem encircled him and leveled against him many serious charges, which they were unable to substantiate.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">In his defense, Paul said by the Holy Spirit, &amp;apos;I have done nothing wrong. I&amp;quot;ve committed no offense against Jewish law, or against the temple, or against Caesar.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Festus, because he wanted to curry favor with the Jews, asked Paul, &amp;apos;Are you willing to go with me to Jerusalem and be tried for these charges?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Paul replied, &amp;apos;I am standing here before Caesar&amp;quot;s tribunal. This is where I should be tried. As you well know, I have done no harm to the Jews.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">If I have committed a crime worthy of death, I won&amp;quot;t seek to escape the death penalty. But if none of their charges are true, no one has the right to hand me over to them. I appeal to Caesar!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">After conferring with the members of his council, Festus replied, &amp;apos;Since you have appealed to Caesar, to Caesar you will go!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Several days later, King Agrippa and Bernice arrived at Caesarea for a visit with Festus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">During their stay of many days, Festus explained Paul&amp;quot;s situation to the king to get his opinion on the matter, saying, &amp;apos;There is a man here whom Felix left as a prisoner.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">When I was in Jerusalem, the leading priests and Jewish elders pressed charges against him and demanded that I issue a guilty verdict against him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">I explained to them that it is not our Roman custom to condemn any man before he has an opportunity to face his accusers and present his defense.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">So they returned here with me. I didn&amp;quot;t postpone the trial, but convened the court the very next day and ordered the man to be brought before me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">I listened to their accusations against him, but they were not what I expected to hear, for he had committed no crime.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Rather, their issues centered around disagreements with him over their religion, and about a dead man named Jesus, who Paul claimed was alive.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Because I was perplexed about how to proceed, I asked him if he would be willing to go to Jerusalem to stand trial on these charges.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">When Paul appealed his case to the emperor for a decision, I ordered him to be held in custody until I could send him to Caesar.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">King Agrippa said to Festus, &amp;apos;I would like to listen to this man myself.&amp;apos; &amp;apos;Tomorrow,&amp;apos; he replied, &amp;apos;you will have that opportunity.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">The next day King Agrippa and Bernice entered the audience hall with much pomp and pageantry. Accompanying them were the senior military officers and prominent citizens. Festus ordered that Paul be brought before them all.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">Then Festus said, &amp;apos;King Agrippa, and esteemed guests, here is the man whom the entire Jewish community, both here and in Jerusalem, has asked me to condemn to death. They have screamed and shouted at me, demanding that I end his life.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">Yet upon investigation I couldn&amp;quot;t find one thing that he has done to deserve the death penalty. When he appealed to His Majesty the emperor, I determined to send him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">But I have nothing concrete to write to His Majesty, so I have now brought him before you all, and especially before you, King Agrippa. After this preliminary hearing I should have something to write,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">for it seems absurd to me to send a prisoner without specifying the charges against him.&amp;apos;</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="26">
			<VERS vnumber="1">King Agrippa said to Paul, &amp;apos;You may now state your case.&amp;apos; Paul motioned with his hand for silence, then began his defense.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">&amp;apos;King Agrippa, I consider myself highly favored to stand before you today and answer the charges made against me by the Jews.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Because you, more than anyone else, are very familiar with the customs and controversies among the Jewish people, I now ask for your patience as I state my case.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">&amp;apos;All the Jews know how I have been raised as a young man, living among my own people from the beginning and in Jerusalem.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">If my accusers are willing to testify, they must admit that they&amp;quot;ve known me all along as a Pharisee, a member of the most strict and orthodox sect within Judaism.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">And now, here I am on trial because I believe in the hope of God&amp;quot;s promises made to our ancestors.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">This is the promise the twelve tribes of our people hope to see fulfilled as they sincerely strive to serve God with prayers night and day. &amp;apos;So, Your Highness, it is because of this hope that the Jews are accusing me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">And how should you judge this matter? Why is it that any of you think it unbelievable that God raises the dead?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">I used to think that I should do all that was in my power to oppose the name of Jesus of Nazareth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">And that&amp;quot;s exactly what I did in Jerusalem, for I not only imprisoned many of the holy believers by the authority of the chief priests, I also cast my vote against them, sentencing them to death.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">I punished them often in every Jewish meeting hall and attempted to force them to blaspheme. I boiled with rage against them, hunting them down in distant foreign cities to persecute them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">&amp;apos;For that purpose I went to Damascus, with the authority granted to me by the chief priests.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">While traveling on the road at noon, Your Highness, I saw a light brighter than the sun flashing from heaven all around me and those who were with me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">We all fell to the ground, and I heard a voice speaking to me in Aramaic, saying, &amp;quot;Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me? You are only hurting yourself when you resist your calling.&amp;quot;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">&amp;apos;I asked, &amp;quot;Who are you, Lord?&amp;quot; &amp;apos;And the Lord replied, &amp;quot;I am Jesus, the one you are persecuting.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Get up and stand to your feet, for I have appeared to you to reveal your destiny and to commission you as my assistant. You will be a witness to what you have seen and to the things I will reveal whenever I appear to you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">I will rescue you from the persecution of your own people and from the hostility of the other nations that I will send you to.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">And you will open their eyes to their true condition, so that they may turn from darkness to the Light and from the power of Satan to the power of God. By placing their faith in me they will receive the total forgiveness of sins and be made holy, taking hold of the inheritance that I give to my children !&amp;quot;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">&amp;apos;So you see, King Agrippa, I have not been disobedient to what was revealed to me from heaven.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">For it was in Damascus that I first declared the truth. And then I went to Jerusalem and throughout our nation, and even to other nations, telling people everywhere that they must repent and turn to God and demonstrate it with a changed life.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">That&amp;quot;s why the Jews seized me when I was in the temple and tried to murder me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">&amp;apos;But in spite of all this, I have experienced the supernatural help of God up to this very moment. So I&amp;quot;m standing here saying the same thing that I&amp;quot;ve shared with everyone, from the least to the greatest. For I teach nothing but what</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">Moses and the prophets have said was destined to happen: that our Messiah had to suffer and die and be the first to rise from the dead, to release the bright light of truth both to our people and to the non-Jewish nations.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">Festus interrupted Paul&amp;quot;s defense, blurting out, &amp;apos;You&amp;quot;re out of your mind! All this great learning of yours is driving you crazy.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">Paul replied, &amp;apos;No, Your Excellency Festus, I am not crazy. I speak the words of truth and reason.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">King Agrippa, I know I can speak frankly and freely with you, for you understand these matters well, and none of these things have escaped your notice. After all, it&amp;quot;s not like it was a secret!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">Don&amp;quot;t you believe the prophets, King Agrippa? I know that you do.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">Agrippa responded, &amp;apos;In such a short time you are nearly persuading me to become a Christian.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">Paul replied, &amp;apos;I pray to God that both you and those here listening to me would one day become the same as I am, except, of course, without these chains.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">The king, the governor, Bernice, and all the others got up.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">As they were leaving the chamber, they commented to one another, &amp;apos;This man has done nothing that deserves death or even imprisonment.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">King Agrippa said to Festus, &amp;apos;If he hadn&amp;quot;t appealed to Caesar, he could have been released.&amp;apos;</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="27">
			<VERS vnumber="1">When it was decided that we were to sail for Italy, Festus handed over Paul and a number of other prisoners to the custody of a Roman officer named Julius, a member of the imperial guard.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">We went on board a ship from the port of Adramyttium that was planning to stop at various ports along the coast of southwestern Turkey. We put out to sea and were accompanied by Aristarchus from Thessalonica in Macedonia.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">The next day we docked at Sidon, and Julius, being considerate of Paul, allowed him to disembark and be refreshed by his friends living there.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">From there we put out to sea, but because the winds were against us, we sailed under the lee of Cyprus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">After sailing across the open sea off Cilicia and Pamphylia, we docked at the port of Myra in Lycia.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">While we were there, the commanding officer found an Egyptian ship from Alexandria that was bound for Italy, and he put us on board.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">We made little headway for several days, and with difficulty we made it to Knidus. The strong winds kept us from holding our course, so from there we sailed along the lee of Crete, opposite Cape Salome.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Hugging the coast, we struggled on to a place called Fair Havens, near the town of Lasea.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">We remained there a long time, until we passed the day of the Jewish fast. Paul advised the frightened sailors that they should not put out to sea in such dangerous weather, saying,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">&amp;apos;Men, I can see that our voyage would be disastrous for us and bring great loss, not only to our ship and cargo but also to our own lives. We should remain here .&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">But the officer in charge was persuaded more by the ship&amp;quot;s helmsman and captain than he was by Paul.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">So the majority decided to put out to sea, since Fair Haven was an exposed harbor and not suitable to winter in. They had hoped to somehow reach the Cretan port of Phineka, which was a more suitable port because it was facing south.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">When a gentle south breeze began to blow, they assumed they could make it, so they pulled up anchor and sailed close to Crete.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">But it wasn&amp;quot;t long before the weather abruptly worsened and a storm of hurricane force called the Nor&amp;quot;easter tore across the island and blew us out to sea.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">The sailors weren&amp;quot;t able to turn the ship into the wind, so they gave up and let it be driven by the gale winds.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">As we passed to the lee of a small island called Cauda, we were barely able to get the ship&amp;quot;s lifeboat under control,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">so the crew hoisted the dinghy aboard. The sailors used ropes and cables to undergird the ship, fearing they would run aground on the shoals of Syrtis. They lowered the drag anchor to slow its speed and let the ship be driven along.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">The next day, because of being battered severely by the storm, the sailors jettisoned the cargo,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">and by the third day they even threw the ship&amp;quot;s tackle and rigging overboard.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">After many days of seeing neither the sun nor the stars, and with the violent storm continuing to rage against us, all hope of ever getting through it alive was abandoned.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">After being without food for a long time, Paul stepped before them all and said, &amp;apos;Men, you should have obeyed me and avoided all of this pain and suffering by not leaving Crete.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Now listen to me. Don&amp;quot;t be depressed, for no one will perish&amp;ndash;only the ship will be lost.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">For God&amp;quot;s angel visited me last night, the angel of my God, the God I passionately serve. He came and stood in front of me</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">and said, &amp;quot;Don&amp;quot;t be afraid, Paul. You are destined to stand trial before Caesar. And because of God&amp;quot;s favor on you, he has given you the lives of everyone who is sailing with you.&amp;quot;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">So men, keep up your courage! I know that God will protect you, just as he told me he would.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">But we must run aground on some island to be saved .&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">On the fourteenth night of being tossed about the Adriatic Sea, about midnight, the sailors sensed we were approaching land.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">So they took soundings and discovered that the water was about 120 feet deep. After sailing a short distance, they again took soundings and found it was only ninety feet deep.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">Fearing we would be dashed against a rocky coast, they dropped four anchors from the stern and waited for morning to come.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">Some sailors pretended to go down to drop anchors from the bow when in fact they wanted to lower the lifeboat into the sea and escape, abandoning ship.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">Paul said to the Roman officer and his soldiers, &amp;apos;Unless you all stay together onboard the ship, you have no chance of surviving.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">At the moment they heard this, the soldiers cut the ropes of the dinghy and let it fall away.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">Just before daybreak, Paul urged everyone to eat. He said, &amp;apos;Today makes two full weeks that you&amp;quot;ve been in fearful peril and hunger, unable to eat a thing.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">Now eat and be nourished. For you&amp;quot;ll all come through this ordeal without a scratch.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">Then Paul took bread and gave thanks to God in front of them, broke it and began to eat.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">After they were satisfied, they threw the grain into the sea to lighten the ship.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">When daylight came, the sailors didn&amp;quot;t recognize the land, but they noticed a cove with a sandy beach, so they decided to run the ship ashore.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">They cut away the anchors, leaving them in the sea, untied the ropes holding the rudders, and hoisted the foresail to the breeze to head for the beach.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">But they drifted into the rocky shoals between two depths of the sea, causing the ship to flounder still a distance from shore. The bow was stuck fast, jammed on the rocks, while the stern was being smashed by the pounding of the surf.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">The soldiers wanted to kill all the prisoners to prevent them from escaping.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43">But the Roman officer was determined to bring Paul safely through, so he foiled their attempts. He commanded the prisoners and crew who could swim to jump overboard and swim ashore.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44">The rest all managed to survive by clinging to planks and broken pieces of the ship, so that everyone scrambled to the shore uninjured.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="28">
			<VERS vnumber="1">After we had safely reached land, we discovered that the island we were on was Malta.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">The people who lived there showed us extraordinary kindness, for they welcomed us around the fire they had built because it was cold and rainy.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">When Paul had gathered an armful of brushwood and was setting it on the fire, a venomous snake was driven out by the heat and latched onto Paul&amp;quot;s hand with its fangs.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">When the islanders saw the snake dangling from Paul&amp;quot;s hand, they said to one another, &amp;apos;No doubt about it, this guy is a murderer. Even though he escaped death at sea, Justice has now caught up with him!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">But Paul shook the snake off, flung it into the fire, and suffered no harm at all.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Everyone watched him, expecting him to swell up or suddenly drop dead. After observing him for a long time and seeing that nothing unusual happened, they changed their minds and said, &amp;apos;He must be a god!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">The Roman governor of the island, named Publius, had his estate nearby. He graciously welcomed us as his houseguests and showed us hospitality for the three days that we stayed with him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">His father lay sick in bed, suffering from fits of high fever and dysentery. So Paul went into his room, and after praying, placed his hands on him. He was instantly healed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">When the people of the island heard about this miracle, they brought all the sick to Paul, and they were also healed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">The islanders honored us greatly, and when we were preparing to set sail again, they gave us all the supplies we needed for our journey.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">After three months we put out to sea on an Egyptian ship from Alexandria that had wintered at the island. The ship had carved on its prow as its emblem the &amp;apos;Heavenly Twins.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">When we landed at Syracuse, we stayed there for three days.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">From there we set sail for the Italian city of Rhegium. The day after we landed, a south wind sprang up that enabled us to reach Puteoli in two days.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">There we found some believers, who begged us to stay with them for a week. Afterward, we made our way to Rome.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">When the believers were alerted we were coming, they came out to meet us at the Forum of Appius while we were still a great distance from Rome . Another group met us at the Three Taverns. When Paul saw the believers, his heart was greatly encouraged and he thanked God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">When we finally entered Rome, Paul was turned over to the authorities and was allowed to live where he pleased, with one soldier assigned to guard him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">After three days Paul called together all the prominent members of the Jewish community of Rome. When they had all assembled, Paul said to them, &amp;apos;My fellow Jews, while I was in Jerusalem, I was handed over as a prisoner of the Romans for prosecution, even though I had done nothing against any of our people or our Jewish customs.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">After hearing my case, the Roman authorities wanted to release me since they found nothing that deserved a death sentence.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">When the Jews objected to this, I felt it necessary, with no malice against them, to appeal to Caesar.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">This, then, is the reason I&amp;quot;ve asked to speak with you, so that I could explain these things. It is only because I believe in the Hope of Israel that I am in chains before you.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">They replied, &amp;apos;We haven&amp;quot;t received any letters from the Jews of Judea, nor has anyone come to us with a bad report about you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">But we are anxious to hear you present your views regarding this Christian sect we&amp;quot;ve been hearing about, for people everywhere are speaking against it.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">So they set a time to meet with Paul. On that day an even greater crowd gathered where he was staying. From morning until evening Paul taught them, opening up the truths of God&amp;quot;s kingdom. With convincing arguments from both the Law and the Prophets, he tried to persuade them about Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">Some were converted, but others refused to believe. They argued back and forth,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">still unable to agree among themselves. They were about to leave when Paul made one last statement to them: &amp;apos;The Holy Spirit stated it well when he spoke to your ancestors through the prophet Isaiah:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">&amp;quot;I send you to this people to say to them, &amp;apos;You will keep learning, but not understanding. You will keep staring at truth but not perceiving it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">For your hearts are hard and insensitive to me&amp;ndash;you must be hard of hearing! For you&amp;quot;ve closed your eyes so that you won&amp;quot;t be troubled by the truth, and you&amp;quot;ve covered your ears so that you won&amp;quot;t have to listen and be pierced by what I say. For then you would have to respond and repent, so that I could heal your hearts.&amp;apos; &amp;quot;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">&amp;apos;So listen well. This wonderful salvation given by God is now being presented to the non-Jewish nations, and they will believe and receive it!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">Paul lived two more years in Rome, in his own rented quarters, welcoming all who came to visit.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">He continued to proclaim to all the truths of God&amp;quot;s kingdom realm, teaching them about the Lord Jesus, the Anointed One, speaking triumphantly and without any restriction.</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="1">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Paul, a loving and loyal servant of the Anointed One, Jesus. He called me to be his apostle and set me apart with a mission to reveal God&amp;quot;s wonderful gospel.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">I write to all his beloved chosen ones in Rome, for you are also called as holy ones. May his joyous grace and total well-being, flowing from our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ, rest upon you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">My commission is to preach the good news. Yet it is not entirely new, but the fulfillment of the hope promised to us through his prophets in the sacred Scriptures.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">For the gospel is all about God&amp;quot;s Son. As a man he descended from David&amp;quot;s royal lineage,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">but as the mighty Son of God he was raised from the dead and miraculously set apart with a display of triumphant power supplied by the Spirit of Holiness. And now Jesus is our Lord and our Messiah.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Through him grace cascaded into us, empowering us with the gift of apostleship, so that we can win people from every nation into the obedience that comes from faith, to bring honor to his name.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">And you are among the chosen ones who are called to belong to Jesus, the Anointed One.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">I give thanks to God for all of you, because the testimony of your faith is spreading throughout the world.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">And God knows that I pray for you continually and at all times. For I serve and worship him with my spirit in the gospel of his Son.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">My desire and constant prayer is that I would succeed in coming to you, according to the plan and timing of God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">I yearn to come and be face-to-face with you and get to know you. For I long to impart to you some spiritual gift that will empower you to stand strong in your faith.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Now, this means that when we come together and are side by side, something wonderful will be released. We can expect to be co-encouraged and co-comforted by each other&amp;quot;s faith!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">So, my dear brothers and sisters, please don&amp;quot;t interpret my failure to visit you as indifference, because many times I&amp;quot;ve intended to come but have not been released to do so up to now. For I long to enjoy a harvest of spiritual fruit among you, like I have experienced among the nations.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Love obligates me to preach to everyone, to those who are among the elite and those who are among the outcasts, to those who are wise and educated as well as to those who are foolish and unlearned.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">This is why I am so excited about coming to preach the wonderful message of Jesus to you in Rome!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">I refuse to be ashamed of the wonderful message of God&amp;quot;s liberating power unleashed in us through Christ! For I am thrilled to preach that everyone who believes is saved&amp;ndash;the Jew first, and then people everywhere!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">This gospel unveils a continual revelation of God&amp;quot;s righteousness&amp;ndash;a perfect righteousness given to us when we believe. And it moves us from receiving life through faith , to the power of living by faith. This is what the Scripture means when it says: &amp;apos;We are right with God through life-giving faith!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">For God in heaven unveils his holy anger breaking forth against every form of sin, both toward ungodliness that lives in hearts and evil actions. For the wickedness of humanity deliberately smothers the truth and keeps people from acknowledging the truth about God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">In reality, the truth of God is known instinctively, for God has embedded this knowledge inside every human heart.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Opposition to truth cannot be excused on the basis of ignorance , because from the creation of the world, the invisible qualities of God&amp;quot;s nature have been made visible, such as his eternal power and transcendence. He has made his wonderful attributes easily perceived, for seeing the visible makes us understand the invisible. So then, this leaves everyone without excuse.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Throughout human history the fingerprints of God were upon them, yet they refused to honor him as God or even be thankful for his kindness. Instead, they entertained corrupt and foolish thoughts about what God was like. This left them with nothing but misguided hearts, steeped in moral darkness.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Although claiming to be wise, they were in fact shallow fools.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">For only a fool would trade the unfading splendor of the immortal God to worship the fading image of other humans, idols made to look like people, animals, birds, and even creeping reptiles!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">This is why God lifted off his restraining hand and let them have full expression of their sinful and shameful desires. They were given over to moral depravity, dishonoring their bodies by sexual perversion among themselves&amp;ndash;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">all because they traded the truth of God for a lie. They worshiped and served the things God made rather than the God who made all things&amp;ndash;glory and praises to him forever and ever! Amen!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">And because they thought it was worthless to embrace the true knowledge of God, God gave them over to a worthless mind-set, to break all rules of proper conduct.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">Their sinful lives became full of every kind of evil, wicked schemes, greed, and cruelty. Their hearts overflowed with jealous cravings, and with conflict and strife, which drove them into hateful arguments and murder. They are deceitful liars full of hostility. They are gossips</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">who love to spread malicious slander. With inflated egos they hurl hateful insults at God, yet they are nothing more than arrogant boasters. They are rebels against their parents and totally immoral.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">They are senseless, faithless, ruthless, heartless, and completely merciless.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">Although they are fully aware of God&amp;quot;s laws and proper order, and knowing that those who do all of these things deserve to die, yet they still go headlong into darkness, encouraging others to do the same and applauding them when they do!</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="2">
			<VERS vnumber="1">No matter who you are, before you judge the wickedness of others, you had better remember this: you are also without excuse, for you too are guilty of the same kind of things! When you judge others, and then do the same things they do, you condemn yourself.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">We know that God&amp;quot;s judgment falls upon those who practice these things. God is always right, because he has all the facts.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">And no matter who you think you are, when you judge others who do these things and then do the same things yourself, what makes you think that you will escape God&amp;quot;s judgment?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Do the riches of his extraordinary kindness make you take him for granted and despise him? Haven&amp;quot;t you experienced how kind and understanding he has been to you? Don&amp;quot;t mistake his tolerance for acceptance. Do you realize that all the wealth of his extravagant kindness is meant to melt your heart and lead you into repentance?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">But because of your calloused heart and refusal to change direction, you are piling up wrath for yourself in the day of wrath, when God&amp;quot;s righteous judgment is revealed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">For: He will give to each one in return for what he has done. &amp;apos;God&amp;quot;s precious name is cursed among the nations because of you.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">For those living in constant goodness and doing what pleases him, seeking an unfading glory and honor and imperishable virtue, will experience eternal life.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">But those governed by selfishness and self-promotion, whose hearts are unresponsive to God&amp;quot;s truth and would rather embrace unrighteousness, will experience the fullness of wrath.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Anyone who does evil can expect tribulation and distress&amp;ndash;to the Jew first and also to the non-Jew.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">But when we do what pleases God, we can expect unfading glory, true honor, and a continual peace&amp;ndash;to the Jew first and also to the non-Jew,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">for God sees us all without partiality.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">When people who have never been exposed to the laws of Moses commit sin, they will still perish for what they do. And those who are under the law of Moses and fail to obey it are condemned by the law.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">For it&amp;quot;s not merely knowing the law that makes you right with God, but doing all that the law says that will cause God to pronounce you innocent.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">For example, whenever people who don&amp;quot;t possess the law as their birthright commit sin, it still confirms that a &amp;apos;law&amp;apos; is present in their conscience. For when they instinctively do what the law requires, that becomes a &amp;apos;law&amp;apos; to govern them, even though they don&amp;quot;t have Mosaic law.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">It demonstrates that the requirements of the law are woven into their hearts. They know what is right and wrong, for their conscience validates this &amp;apos;law&amp;apos; in their heart. Their thoughts correct them in one instance and commend them in another.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">So this judgment will be revealed on the day when God, through Jesus the Messiah, judges the hidden secrets of people&amp;quot;s hearts. And their response to my gospel will be the standard of judgment used in that day.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Now, you claim to be a Jew because you lean upon your trust in the law and boast in your relationship with God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">And you claim to know the will of God, and to have the moral high ground because you&amp;quot;ve been taught the law of Moses.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">You are also confident that you are a qualified guide to those who are &amp;apos;blind,&amp;apos; a shining light to those who live in darkness.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">You are confident that you are a true teacher of the foolish and immature, all because you have the treasury of truth and knowledge in the law of Moses.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">So let me ask you this: Why don&amp;quot;t you practice what you preach? You preach, &amp;apos;Don&amp;quot;t steal!&amp;apos; but are you a thief?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">You are swift to tell others, &amp;apos;Don&amp;quot;t commit adultery!&amp;apos; but are you guilty of adultery? You say, &amp;apos;I hate idolatry and false gods!&amp;apos; but do you withhold from the true God what is due him?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">Even though you boast in the law, you dishonor God, the Lawgiver, when you break it!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">For your actions seem to fulfill what is written:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">You trust in the covenant sign of circumcision , yet circumcision only has value if you faithfully keep the teachings of the law. But if you violate the law, you have invalidated your circumcision.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">And if the uncircumcised one faithfully keeps the law, won&amp;quot;t his obedience make him more &amp;apos;Jewish&amp;apos; than the actual rite of circumcision?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">And won&amp;quot;t the one who has never had the knife cut his foreskin be your judge when you break the law?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">You are not a Jew if it&amp;quot;s only superficial&amp;ndash;for it&amp;quot;s more than the surgical cut of a knife that makes you Jewish.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">But you are Jewish because of the inward act of spiritual circumcision&amp;ndash;a radical change that lays bare your heart. It&amp;quot;s not by the principle of the written code, but by power of the Holy Spirit. For then your praise will not come from people, but from God himself!</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="3">
			<VERS vnumber="1">So then what is the importance of circumcision, and what advantage is there of being a Jew?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Actually, there are numerous advantages. Most important, God distinguished the Jews from all other people by entrusting them with the revelation of his prophetic promises.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">But what if some were unfaithful to their divine calling? Does their unbelief weaken God&amp;quot;s faithfulness?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Absolutely not! God will always be proven faithful and true to his word, while people are proven to be liars. This will fulfill what was written in the Scriptures: Your words will always be vindicated and you will rise victorious There is no one who always does what is right, no, not even one! and there is no one who seeks after God alone. All have become depraved and unfit. Kindness has disappeared from them all, Deceitful lies roll off their tongues. when you are being tried by your critics! not even one is good. like the smell of death&amp;ndash;foul and filthy! The venom of a viper drips from their lips. only meant to cut and harm.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">But what if our wrong shows how right God is? Doesn&amp;quot;t our bad serve the purpose of making God look good? (Of course, I&amp;quot;m only speaking from a human viewpoint.) Would that infer that God is unfair when he displays his anger against wrongdoing?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Absolutely not! For if that were the case, how could God be the righteous judge of all the earth?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">So, if my lie brings into sharp contrast the brightness of God&amp;quot;s truth, and if my lie accentuates his glory, then why should I be condemned as a sinner?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Is it proper for us to sin, just so good things may come? May it never be! Yet there are some who slander us and claim that is what we teach. They deserve to be condemned for even saying it!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">So, are we to conclude then that we Jews are superior to all others? Certainly not! For we have already proven that both Jews and gentiles are all under the bondage of sin.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">And the Scriptures agree, for it is written:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">There is no one with true spiritual insight,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">All have deliberately wandered from God&amp;quot;s ways.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Their words release a stench,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Bitter profanity flows from their mouths,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">They are infatuated with violence and murder.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">They release ruin and misery wherever they go.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">They never experience the path of peace.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">They shut their eyes to the awe-inspiring God!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Now, we realize that everything the law says is addressed to those who are under its authority. This is for two reasons: So that every excuse will be silenced, with no boasting of innocence . And so that the entire world will be held accountable to God&amp;quot;s standards.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">For by the merit of observing the law no one earns the status of being declared righteous before God, for it is the law that fully exposes and unmasks the reality of sin.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">for we all have sinned and are in need of the glory of God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">Yet through his powerful declaration of acquittal, God freely gives away his righteousness. His gift of love and favor now cascades over us, all because Jesus, the Anointed One, has liberated us from the guilt, punishment, and power of sin!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">Jesus&amp;quot; God-given destiny was to be the sacrifice to take away sins, and now he is our mercy seat because of his death on the cross. We come to him for mercy, for God has made a provision for us to be forgiven by faith in the sacred blood of Jesus. This is the perfect demonstration of God&amp;quot;s justice, because until now, he had been so patient&amp;ndash;holding back his justice out of his tolerance for us. So he covered over the sins of those who lived prior to Jesus&amp;quot; sacrifice.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">And when the season of tolerance came to an end, there was only one possible way for God to give away his righteousness and still be true to both his justice and his mercy&amp;ndash;to offer up his own Son. So now, because we stand on the faithfulness of Jesus, God declares us righteous in his eyes!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">Where, then, is there room for boasting? Do our works bring God&amp;quot;s acceptance? Not at all! It was not our works of keeping the law but our faith in his finished work that makes us right with God .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">So our conclusion is this: God&amp;quot;s wonderful declaration that we are righteous in his eyes can only come when we put our faith in Christ, and not in keeping the law.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">After all, is God the God of the Jews only, or is he equally the God for all of humanity? Of course, he&amp;quot;s the God of all people!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">Since there is only one God, he will treat us all the same&amp;ndash;he eliminates our guilt and makes us right with him by faith no matter who we are.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">Does emphasizing our faith invalidate the law? Absolutely not. Instead, our faith establishes the role the law should rightfully have.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="4">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Let me use Abraham as an example. It is clear that humanly speaking, he was the founder of Judaism. What was his experience of being made right with God?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Was it by his good works of keeping the law? No. For if it was by the things he did, he would have something to boast about, but no one boasts before God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Listen to what the Scriptures say: Because Abraham believed God&amp;quot;s words, his faith transferred God&amp;quot;s righteousness into his account. What happy fulfillment is ahead for those and whose sins are covered by blood . &amp;apos;I will never hold your sins against you!&amp;apos; &amp;apos;I have made you the father of many nations.&amp;apos; He is our example and father, for in God&amp;quot;s presence he believed that God can raise the dead and call into being things that don&amp;quot;t even exist yet. that they will be impossible to count!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">When people work, they earn wages. It can&amp;quot;t be considered a free gift, because they earned it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">But no one earns God&amp;quot;s righteousness. It can only be transferred when we no longer rely on our own works, but believe in the one who powerfully declares the ungodly to be righteous in his eyes. It is faith that transfers God&amp;quot;s righteousness into your account!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Even King David himself speaks to us regarding the complete wholeness that comes inside a person when God&amp;quot;s powerful declaration of righteousness is heard over our life. Apart from our works, God&amp;quot;s work is enough.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Here&amp;quot;s what David says: whose rebellion has been forgiven when they hear the Lord speak over them, &amp;apos;Your descendants will be so many</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">What happy progress comes to them</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Now, think about it. Does this happiness come only to the Jews, or is it available to all who believe? Our answer is this: faith was credited to Abraham as God&amp;quot;s righteousness!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">How did he receive this gift of righteousness? Was he circumcised at the time God accepted him, or was he still uncircumcised? Clearly, he was an uncircumcised gentile when God said this of him!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">It was later that he received the external sign of circumcision as a seal to confirm that God had already transferred his righteousness to him by faith, while he was still uncircumcised. So now this qualifies him to become the father of all who believe among the non-Jewish people. And like their &amp;apos;father of faith,&amp;apos; Abraham, God also transfers his righteousness to them by faith.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Yes, Abraham is obviously the true father of faith for the Jewish people who are not only circumcised but who walk in the way of faith that our father Abraham displayed before his circumcision.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">God promised Abraham and his descendants that they would have an heir who would reign over the world. This royal promise was not fulfilled because Abraham kept all the law, but through the righteousness that was transferred by faith.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">For if keeping the law earns the inheritance, then faith is robbed of its power and the promise becomes useless.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">For the law provokes punishment, and where no law exists there cannot be a violation of the law.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">The promise depends on faith so that it can be experienced as a grace-gift, and now it extends to all the descendants of Abraham. This promise is not only meant for those who obey the law, but also to those who enter into the faith of Abraham, the father of us all.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">That&amp;quot;s what the Scripture means when it says:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Against all odds, when it looked hopeless, Abraham believed the promise and expected God to fulfill it. He took God at his word, and as a result he became the father of many nations. God&amp;quot;s declaration over him came to pass:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">In spite of being nearly one hundred years old when the promise of having a son was made, his faith was so strong that it could not be undermined by the fact that he and Sarah were incapable of conceiving a child.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">So now you can see why Abraham&amp;quot;s faith was credited to his account as righteousness before God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">And this declaration was not just spoken over Abraham,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">but also over us. For when we believe and embrace the one who brought our Lord Jesus back to life, perfect righteousness will be credited to our account as well.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">Jesus was handed over to be crucified for the forgiveness of our sins and was raised back to life to prove that he had made us right with God!</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="5">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Our faith in Jesus transfers God&amp;quot;s righteousness to us and he now declares us flawless in his eyes. This means we can now enjoy true and lasting peace with God, all because of what our Lord Jesus, the Anointed One, has done for us.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Our faith guarantees us permanent access into this marvelous kindness that has given us a perfect relationship with God. What incredible joy bursts forth within us as we keep on celebrating our hope of experiencing God&amp;quot;s glory!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">But that&amp;quot;s not all! Even in times of trouble we have a joyful confidence, knowing that our pressures will develop in us patient endurance.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">And patient endurance will refine our character, and proven character leads us back to hope.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">And this hope is not a disappointing fantasy, because we can now experience the endless love of God cascading into our hearts through the Holy Spirit who lives in us!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">For when the time was right, the Anointed One came and died to demonstrate his love for sinners who were entirely helpless, weak, and powerless to save themselves.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Now, would anyone dare to die for the sake of a wicked person? We can all understand if someone was willing to die for a truly noble person.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">But Christ proved God&amp;quot;s passionate love for us by dying in our place while we were still lost and ungodly!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">And there is still much more to say of his unfailing love for us! For through the blood of Jesus we have heard the powerful declaration, &amp;apos;You are now righteous in my sight.&amp;apos; And because of the sacrifice of Jesus, you will never experience the wrath of God .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">So if while we were still enemies, God fully reconciled us to himself through the death of his Son, then something greater than friendship is ours. Now that we are at peace with God, and because we share in his resurrection life, how much more we will be rescued from sin&amp;quot;s dominion!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">And even more than that, we overflow with triumphant joy in our new relationship of living reconciled to God&amp;ndash;all because of Jesus Christ!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">When Adam sinned, the entire world was affected. Sin entered human experience, and death was the result. And so death followed this sin, casting its shadow over all humanity, because all have sinned.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Sin was in the world before Moses gave the written law, but it was not charged against them where no law existed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Yet death reigned as king from Adam to Moses even though they hadn&amp;quot;t broken a command the way Adam had . The first man, Adam, was a picture of the Messiah, who was to come.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Now, there is no comparison between Adam&amp;quot;s transgression and the gracious gift that we experience. For the magnitude of the gift far outweighs the crime . It&amp;quot;s true that many died because of one man&amp;quot;s transgression, but how much greater will God&amp;quot;s grace and his gracious gift of acceptance overflow to many because of what one man, Jesus, the Messiah, did for us!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">And this free-flowing gift imparts to us much more than what was given to us through the one who sinned. For because of one transgression, we are all facing a death sentence with a verdict of &amp;apos;Guilty!&amp;apos; But this gracious gift leaves us free from our many failures and brings us into the perfect righteousness of God&amp;ndash;acquitted with the words &amp;apos;Not guilty!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Death once held us in its grip, and by the blunder of one man, death reigned as king over humanity. But now, how much more are we held in the grip of grace and continue reigning as kings in life, enjoying our regal freedom through the gift of perfect righteousness in the one and only Jesus, the Messiah!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">In other words, just as condemnation came upon all people through one transgression, so through one righteous act of Jesus&amp;quot; sacrifice , the perfect righteousness that makes us right with God and leads us to a victorious life is now available to all.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">One man&amp;quot;s disobedience opened the door for all humanity to become sinners. So also one man&amp;quot;s obedience opened the door for many to be made perfectly right with God and acceptable to him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">So then, the law was introduced into God&amp;quot;s plan to bring the reality of human sinfulness out of hiding. And yet, wherever sin increased, there was more than enough of God&amp;quot;s grace to triumph all the more!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">And just as sin reigned through death, so also this sin-conquering grace will reign as king through righteousness, imparting eternal life through Jesus, our Lord and Messiah!</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="6">
			<VERS vnumber="1">So what do we do, then? Do we persist in sin so that God&amp;quot;s kindness and grace will increase?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">What a terrible thought! We have died to sin once and for all, as a dead man passes away from this life. So how could we live under sin&amp;quot;s rule a moment longer?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Or have you forgotten that all of us who were immersed into union with Jesus, the Anointed One, were immersed into union with his death?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Sharing in his death by our baptism means that we were co-buried with him, so that when the Father&amp;quot;s glory raised Christ from the dead, we were also raised with him. We have been co-resurrected with him so that we could be empowered to walk in the freshness of new life.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">For since we are permanently grafted into him to experience a death like his, then we are permanently grafted into him to experience a resurrection like his and the new life that it imparts.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Could it be any clearer that our former identity is now and forever deprived of its power? For we were co-crucified with him to dismantle the stronghold of sin within us, so that we would not continue to live one moment longer submitted to sin&amp;quot;s power.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Obviously, a dead person is incapable of sinning.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">And if we were co-crucified with the Anointed One, we know that we will also share in the fullness of his life.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">And we know that since the Anointed One has been raised from the dead to die no more, his resurrection life has vanquished death and its power over him is finished.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">For by his sacrifice he died to sin&amp;quot;s power once and for all, but he now lives continuously for the Father&amp;quot;s pleasure.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">So let it be the same way with you! Since you are now joined with him, you must continually view yourselves as dead and unresponsive to sin&amp;quot;s appeal while living daily for God&amp;quot;s pleasure in union with Jesus, the Anointed One.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Sin is a dethroned monarch; so you must no longer give it an opportunity to rule over your life, controlling how you live and compelling you to obey its desires and cravings.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">So then, refuse to answer its call to surrender your body as a tool for wickedness. Instead, passionately answer God&amp;quot;s call to keep yielding your body to him as one who has now experienced resurrection life! You live now for his pleasure, ready to be used for his noble purpose.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Remember this: sin will not conquer you, for God already has! You are not governed by law but governed by the reign of the grace of God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">What are we to do, then? Should we sin to our hearts&amp;quot; content since there&amp;quot;s no law to condemn us anymore? What a terrible thought!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Don&amp;quot;t you realize that grace frees you to choose your own master? But choose carefully, for you surrender yourself to become a servant&amp;ndash;bound to the one you choose to obey. If you choose to love sin, it will become your master, and it will own you and reward you with death. But if you choose to love and obey God, he will lead you into perfect righteousness.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">And thanks be to God, for in the past you were servants of sin, but now your obedience is heart deep, and your life is being molded by truth through the teaching you are devoted to.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">And now you celebrate your freedom from your former master&amp;ndash;sin. You&amp;quot;ve left its bondage, and now God&amp;quot;s perfect righteousness holds power over you as his loving servants.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">I&amp;quot;ve used the familiar terms of a &amp;apos;servant&amp;apos; and a &amp;apos;master&amp;apos; to compensate for your weakness to understand. For just as you surrendered your bodies and souls to impurity and lawlessness, which only brought more lawlessness into your lives, so now surrender yourselves as servants of righteousness, which brings you deeper into true holiness.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">For when you were bound as servants to sin, you lived your lives free from any obligation to righteousness.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">So tell me, what benefit ensued from doing those things that you&amp;quot;re now ashamed of? It left you with nothing but a legacy of shame and death.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">But now, as God&amp;quot;s loving servants, you live in joyous freedom from the power of sin. So consider the benefits you now enjoy&amp;ndash;you are brought deeper into the experience of true holiness that ends with eternal life!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">For sin&amp;quot;s meager wages is death, but God&amp;quot;s lavish gift is life eternal, found in your union with our Lord Jesus, the Anointed One.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="7">
			<VERS vnumber="1">I write to you, dear brothers and sisters, who are familiar with the law. Don&amp;quot;t you know that when a person dies, it ends his obligation to the law?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">For example, a married couple is bound by the law to remain together until separated by death. But when one spouse dies, the other is released from the law of the marriage.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">So then if a wife is joined to another man while still married, she commits adultery. But if her husband dies, she is obviously free from the marriage contract and may marry another man without being charged with adultery.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">So, my dear brothers and sisters, the same principle applies to your relationship with God. For you died to your first husband , the law, by being co-crucified with the body of the Messiah. So you are now free to &amp;apos;marry&amp;apos; another&amp;ndash;the one who was raised from the dead so that you may now bear spiritual fruit for God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">When we were merely living natural lives, the law, through defining sin , actually awakened sinful desires within us, which resulted in bearing the fruit of death.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">But now that we have been fully released from the power of the law, we are dead to what once controlled us. And our lives are no longer motivated by the obsolete way of following the written code, so that now we may serve God by living in the freshness of a new life in the power of the Holy Spirit.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">So, what shall we say about all this? Am I suggesting that the law is sinful? Of course not! In fact, it was the law that gave us the clear definition of sin. For example, when the law said, &amp;apos;Do not covet,&amp;apos; it became the catalyst to see how wrong it was for me to crave what belongs to someone else.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">It was through God&amp;quot;s commandment that sin was awakened in me and built its base of operation within me to stir up every kind of wrong desire. For in the absence of the law, sin hides dormant.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Sin, by means of the commandment, built a base of operation within me, to overpower me and put me to death.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">So then, we have to conclude that the problem is not with the law itself, for the law is holy and its commandments are correct and for our good.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">So, did something meant to be good become death to me? Certainly not! It was not the law but sin unmasked that produced my spiritual death. The sacred commandment merely uncovered the evil of sin so it could be seen for what it is.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">For we know that the law is divinely inspired and comes from the spiritual realm, but I am a human being made of flesh and trafficked as a slave under sin&amp;quot;s authority.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">I&amp;quot;m a mystery to myself, for I want to do what is right, but end up doing what my moral instincts condemn.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">And if my behavior is not in line with my desire, my conscience still confirms the excellence of the law.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">And now I realize that it is no longer my true self doing it, but the unwelcome intruder of sin in my humanity.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">For I know that nothing good lives within the flesh of my fallen humanity. The longings to do what is right are within me, but willpower is not enough to accomplish it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">My lofty desires to do what is good are dashed when I do the things I want to avoid.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">So if my behavior contradicts my desires to do good, I must conclude that it&amp;quot;s not my true identity doing it, but the unwelcome intruder of sin hindering me from being who I really am .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Through my experience of this principle, I discover that even when I want to do good, evil is ready to sabotage me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Truly, deep within my true identity, I love to do what pleases God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">But I discern another power operating in my humanity, waging a war against the moral principles of my conscience and bringing me into captivity as a prisoner to the &amp;apos;law&amp;apos; of sin&amp;ndash;this unwelcome intruder in my humanity.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">What an agonizing situation I am in! So who has the power to rescue this miserable man from the unwelcome intruder of sin and death?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">I give all my thanks to God, for his mighty power has finally provided a way out through our Lord Jesus, the Anointed One! So if left to myself, the flesh is aligned with the law of sin, but now my renewed mind is fixed on and submitted to God&amp;quot;s righteous principles.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="8">
			<VERS vnumber="1">So now the case is closed . There remains no accusing voice of condemnation against those who are joined in life-union with Jesus, the Anointed One.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">For the &amp;apos;law&amp;apos; of the Spirit of life flowing through the anointing of Jesus has liberated us from the &amp;apos;law&amp;apos; of sin and death.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">For God achieved what the law was unable to accomplish, because the law was limited by the weakness of human nature. Yet God sent us his Son in human form to identify with human weakness. Clothed with humanity, God&amp;quot;s Son gave his body to be the sin-offering so that God could once and for all condemn the guilt and power of sin. But hope means that we must trust and wait for what is still unseen. For why would we need to hope for something we already have? All day long we face death threats for your sake, God. We are considered to be nothing more</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">So now every righteous requirement of the law can be fulfilled through the Anointed One living his life in us. And we are free to live, not according to our flesh, but by the dynamic power of the Holy Spirit!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Those who are motivated by the flesh only pursue what benefits themselves. But those who live by the impulses of the Holy Spirit are motivated to pursue spiritual realities.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">For the sense and reason of the flesh is death, but the mind-set controlled by the Spirit finds life and peace.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">In fact, the mind-set focused on the flesh fights God&amp;quot;s plan and refuses to submit to his direction, because it cannot!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">For no matter how hard they try, God finds no pleasure with those who are controlled by the flesh.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">But when the Spirit of Christ empowers your life, you are not dominated by the flesh but by the Spirit. And if you are not joined to the Spirit of the Anointed One, you are not of him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Now Christ lives his life in you! And even though your body may be dead because of the effects of sin, his life-giving Spirit imparts life to you because you are fully accepted by God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Yes, God raised Jesus to life! And since God&amp;quot;s Spirit of Resurrection lives in you, he will also raise your dying body to life by the same Spirit that breathes life into you!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">So then, beloved ones, the flesh has no claims on us at all, and we have no further obligation to live in obedience to it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">For when you live controlled by the flesh, you are about to die. But if the life of the Spirit puts to death the corrupt ways of the flesh, we then taste his abundant life.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">The mature children of God are those who are moved by the impulses of the Holy Spirit.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">And you did not receive the &amp;apos;spirit of religious duty,&amp;apos; leading you back into the fear of never being good enough . But you have received the &amp;apos;Spirit of full acceptance,&amp;apos; enfolding you into the family of God. And you will never feel orphaned, for as he rises up within us, our spirits join him in saying the words of tender affection, &amp;apos;Beloved Father!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">For the Holy Spirit makes God&amp;quot;s fatherhood real to us as he whispers into our innermost being, &amp;apos;You are God&amp;quot;s beloved child!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">And since we are his true children, we qualify to share all his treasures, for indeed, we are heirs of God himself. And since we are joined to Christ, we also inherit all that he is and all that he has. We will experience being co-glorified with him provided that we accept his sufferings as our own.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">I am convinced that any suffering we endure is less than nothing compared to the magnitude of glory that is about to be unveiled within us.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">The entire universe is standing on tiptoe, yearning to see the unveiling of God&amp;quot;s glorious sons and daughters!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">For against its will the universe itself has had to endure the empty futility resulting from the consequences of human sin. But now, with eager expectation,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">all creation longs for freedom from its slavery to decay and to experience with us the wonderful freedom coming to God&amp;quot;s children.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">To this day we are aware of the universal agony and groaning of creation, as if it were in the contractions of labor for childbirth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">And it&amp;quot;s not just creation. We who have already experienced the firstfruits of the Spirit also inwardly groan as we passionately long to experience our full status as God&amp;quot;s sons and daughters&amp;ndash;including our physical bodies being transformed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">For this is the hope of our salvation.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">So because our hope is set on what is yet to be seen, we patiently keep on waiting for its fulfillment.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">And in a similar way, the Holy Spirit takes hold of us in our human frailty to empower us in our weakness. For example, at times we don&amp;quot;t even know how to pray, or know the best things to ask for. But the Holy Spirit rises up within us to super-intercede on our behalf, pleading to God with emotional sighs too deep for words.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">God, the searcher of the heart, knows fully our longings, yet he also understands the desires of the Spirit, because the Holy Spirit passionately pleads before God for us, his holy ones, in perfect harmony with God&amp;quot;s plan and our destiny.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">So we are convinced that every detail of our lives is continually woven together for good, for we are his lovers who have been called to fulfill his designed purpose.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">For he knew all about us before we were born and he destined us from the beginning to share the likeness of his Son. This means the Son is the oldest among a vast family of brothers and sisters who will become just like him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">Having determined our destiny ahead of time, he called us to himself and transferred his perfect righteousness to everyone he called. And those who possess his perfect righteousness he co-glorified with his Son!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">So, what does all this mean? If God has determined to stand with us, tell me, who then could ever stand against us?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">For God has proved his love by giving us his greatest treasure, the gift of his Son. And since God freely offered him up as the sacrifice for us all, he certainly won&amp;quot;t withhold from us anything else he has to give.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">Who then would dare to accuse those whom God has chosen in love to be his? God himself is the judge who has issued his final verdict over them&amp;ndash;&amp;apos;Not guilty!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">Who then is left to condemn us? Certainly not Jesus, the Anointed One! For he gave his life for us, and even more than that, he has conquered death and is now risen, exalted, and enthroned by God at his right hand. So how could he possibly condemn us since he is continually praying for our triumph ?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">Who could ever divorce us from the endless love of God&amp;quot;s Anointed One? Absolutely no one! For nothing in the universe has the power to diminish his love toward us. Troubles, pressures, and problems are unable to come between us and heaven&amp;quot;s love. What about persecutions, deprivations, dangers, and death threats? No, for they are all impotent to hinder omnipotent love,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">even though it is written: than sheep to be slaughtered!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">Yet even in the midst of all these things, we triumph over them all, for God has made us to be more than conquerors, and his demonstrated love is our glorious victory over everything!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">So now I live with the confidence that there is nothing in the universe with the power to separate us from God&amp;quot;s love. I&amp;quot;m convinced that his love will triumph over death, life&amp;quot;s troubles, fallen angels, or dark rulers in the heavens. There is nothing in our present or future circumstances that can weaken his love.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">There is no power above us or beneath us&amp;ndash;no power that could ever be found in the universe that can distance us from God&amp;quot;s passionate love, which is lavished upon us through our Lord Jesus, the Anointed One!</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="9">
			<VERS vnumber="5">We trace our beginnings back to the patriarchs, and through their bloodline is the genealogy of the Messiah, who is God over everything. May he be praised through endless ages! Amen!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Clearly, God has not failed to fulfill his promises to Israel, for that will never happen! But not everyone who has descended from Israel belongs to Israel.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Physical descent from Abraham doesn&amp;quot;t guarantee the inheritance, because God has said:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">This confirms that it is not merely the natural offspring of Abraham who are considered the children of God; rather, the children born because of God&amp;quot;s promise are counted as descendants.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">For God promised Abraham:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Now, this son was our ancestor, Isaac, who, with his wife, Rebekah, conceived twins.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">For in the words of Scripture:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">So, what does all this mean? Are we saying that God is unfair? Of course not!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">He had every right to say to Moses:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Again, this proves that God&amp;quot;s choice doesn&amp;quot;t depend on how badly someone wants it or tries to earn it, but it depends on God&amp;quot;s kindness and mercy.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">For just as God said to Pharaoh:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">So again we see that it is entirely up to God to show mercy or to harden the hearts of whomever he chooses.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Well then, one might ask, &amp;apos;If God is in complete control, how could he blame us? For who can resist whatever he wants done?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">But who do you think you are to second-guess God? How could a human being molded out of clay say to the one who molded him, &amp;apos;Why in the world did you make me this way?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Or are you denying the right of the potter to make out of clay whatever he wants? Doesn&amp;quot;t the potter have the right to make from the same lump of clay an elegant vase or an ordinary pot?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">And in the same way, although God has every right to unleash his anger and demonstrate his power, yet he is extremely patient with those who deserve wrath&amp;ndash;vessels prepared for destruction.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">And doesn&amp;quot;t he also have the right to release the revelation of the wealth of his glory to his vessels of mercy, whom God prepared beforehand to receive his glory?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">Even for us, whether we are Jews or non-Jews, we are those he has called to experience his glory.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">Remember the prophecy God gave in Hosea:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">And:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">And the prophet Isaiah cries out to Israel:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">For the Lord will act</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">Just as Isaiah saw it coming and prophesied:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">So then, what does all this mean? Here&amp;quot;s the irony : The non-Jewish people, who weren&amp;quot;t even pursuing righteousness, were the ones who seized it&amp;ndash;a perfect righteousness that is transferred by faith.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">Yet Israel, even though pursuing a legal righteousness, did not attain to it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">And why was that? Because they did not pursue the path of faith but insisted on pursuing righteousness by works, as if it could be seized another way. They were offended by the means of obtaining it and stumbled over the stumbling stone,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">just as it is written:</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="10">
			<VERS vnumber="1">My beloved brothers and sisters, the passionate desire of my heart and constant prayer to God is for my fellow Israelites to experience salvation.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">For I know that although they are deeply devoted to God, they are unenlightened.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">And since they&amp;quot;ve ignored the righteousness God gives, wanting instead to be acceptable to God because of their own works, they&amp;quot;ve refused to submit to God&amp;quot;s faith-righteousness.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">For Christ is the end of the law. And because of him, God has transferred his perfect righteousness to all who believe.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Moses wrote long ago about the need to obey every part of the law in order to be declared right with God: &amp;apos;The one who obeys these things must always live by them.&amp;apos; &amp;apos;God&amp;quot;s living message is very close to you, as close as your own heart beating in your chest and as near as the tongue in your mouth.&amp;apos; &amp;apos;Everyone who believes in him will never be disappointed.&amp;apos; How welcome is the arrival and believes our message? and its message has gone to the ends of the earth! to provoke you to anger.&amp;apos; I manifested myself before those who weren&amp;quot;t even asking to know me!&amp;apos; and stubborn people!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">But we receive the faith-righteousness that speaks an entirely different message: &amp;apos;Don&amp;quot;t for a moment think you need to climb into the heavens to find the Messiah and bring him down, &amp;apos;Everyone who calls on the Lord&amp;quot;s name will experience new life.&amp;apos; of those proclaiming the joyful news of peace and of good things to come! Lord, is there anyone who hears The voice has been heard throughout the world, &amp;apos;I will make you jealous of a people who are &amp;quot;nobodies.&amp;quot; And I will use people with no understanding &amp;apos;Those who found me weren&amp;quot;t even seeking me. &amp;apos;With love I have held out my hands day after day, offering myself to this unbelieving</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">or to descend into the underworld to bring him up from the dead.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">But the faith-righteousness we receive speaks to us in these words of Moses:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">And what is God&amp;quot;s &amp;apos;living message&amp;apos;? It is the revelation of faith for salvation, which is the message that we preach. For if you publicly declare with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will experience salvation.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">The heart that believes in him receives the gift of the righteousness of God&amp;ndash;and then the mouth confesses, resulting in salvation.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">For the Scriptures encourage us with these words:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">So then faith eliminates the distinction between Jew and non-Jew, for he is the same Lord for all people. And he has enough treasures to lavish generously upon all who call on him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">And it&amp;quot;s true:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">But how can people call on him for help if they&amp;quot;ve not yet believed? And how can they believe in one they&amp;quot;ve not yet heard of? And how can they hear the message of life if there is no one there to proclaim it?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">And how can the message be proclaimed if messengers have yet to be sent? That&amp;quot;s why the Scriptures say:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">But not everyone welcomes the good news, as Isaiah said:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Faith, then, is birthed in a heart that responds to God&amp;quot;s anointed utterance of the Anointed One.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Can it be that Israel hasn&amp;quot;t heard the message? No, they have heard it, for:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">So again I ask, didn&amp;quot;t Israel already understand that God&amp;quot;s message was for others as well as for themselves? Yes, they certainly did understand , for Moses was the first to state it:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">And Isaiah the fearless prophet dared to declare:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Yet regarding Israel Isaiah says:</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="11">
			<VERS vnumber="1">So then I ask you this question: did God really push aside and reject his people? Absolutely not! For I myself am a Jew, a descendant of Abraham, from the tribe of Benjamin.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">God has not rejected his chosen, destined people! Haven&amp;quot;t you heard Elijah&amp;quot;s testimony in the Scriptures, and how he prays to God, agonizing over Israel?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">&amp;apos;Lord, they&amp;quot;ve murdered your prophets; they&amp;quot;ve demolished your altars. Now I&amp;quot;m the only one left and they want to kill me!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">But what was the revelation God spoke to him in response? &amp;apos; You are not alone . For I have preserved a remnant for myself&amp;ndash;seven thousand others who are faithful and have refused to worship Baal.&amp;apos; God granted them a spirit of deep slumber. and prevented their ears from hearing May their table prove to be a snare Let them be stooped over continually. A partial and temporary hardening to the gospel has come over Israel, which will last until the full number of non-Jews has come into God&amp;quot;s family. and he will turn Jacob away from evil. when I forgive their sins.&amp;apos; to advise him in his plans? that obligates God to owe him something in return?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">And that is but one example of what God is doing in this age of fulfillment, for God&amp;quot;s grace empowers his chosen remnant.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">And since it is by God&amp;quot;s grace, it can&amp;quot;t be a matter of their good works; otherwise, it wouldn&amp;quot;t be a gift of grace, but earned by human effort.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">So then, Israel failed to achieve what it had strived for, but the divinely chosen remnant receives it by grace, while the rest were hardened and unable to receive the truth .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Just as it is written: He closed their eyes to the truth up to this very day. and a trap to cause their ruin. Bring them the retribution they deserve. &amp;apos;Coming from Zion will be the Savior, or is wise enough to be the one &amp;apos;Who has ever first given something to God</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">And King David also prophesied this:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Blindfold their eyes and don&amp;quot;t let them see.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">So, am I saying that Israel stumbled so badly that they will never get back up? Certainly not! Rather, it was because of their stumble that salvation now extends to all the non-Jewish people, in order to make Israel jealous and desire the very things that God has freely given them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">So if all the world is being greatly enriched through their failure, and through their fall great spiritual wealth is given to the non-Jewish people, imagine how much more will Israel&amp;quot;s awakening bring to us all!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Now, I speak to you who are not Jewish, since I am an apostle to reach the non-Jewish people. And I draw attention to this ministry as much as I can when I am among the Jews,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">hoping to make them jealous of what God has given to those who are not Jews, winning some of my people to salvation.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">For if their temporary rejection released the reconciling power of grace into the world, what will happen when Israel is reinstated and reconciled to God? It will unleash resurrection power throughout the whole earth!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Since Abraham and the patriarchs are consecrated and set apart for God, so also will their descendants be set apart. If the roots of a tree are holy and set apart for God, so too will be the branches.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">However, some of the branches have been pruned away. And you, who were once nothing more than a wild olive branch, God has grafted in&amp;ndash;inserting you among the remaining branches as a joint partner to share in the wonderful richness of the cultivated olive stem.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">So don&amp;quot;t be so arrogant as to believe that you are superior to the natural branches. There&amp;quot;s no reason to boast, for the new branches don&amp;quot;t support the root, but you owe your life to the root that supports you!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">You might begin to think that some branches were pruned or broken off just to make room for you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Yes, that&amp;quot;s true. They were removed because of their unbelief. But remember this: you are only attached by your faith. So don&amp;quot;t be presumptuous, but stand in awe and reverence.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Since God didn&amp;quot;t spare the natural branches that fell into unbelief, perhaps he won&amp;quot;t spare you either!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">So fix your gaze on the simultaneous kindness and strict justice of God. How severely he treated those who fell into unbelief! Yet how tender and kind is his relationship with you. So keep on trusting in his kindness; otherwise, you also will be cut off.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">God is more than ready to graft back in the natural branches when they turn from clinging to their unbelief to embracing faith.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">For if God grafted you in, even though you were taken from what is by nature a wild olive tree, how much more can he reconnect the natural branches by inserting them back into their own cultivated olive tree!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">My beloved brothers and sisters, I want to share with you a mystery concerning Israel&amp;quot;s future. For understanding this mystery will keep you from thinking you already know everything.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">And then God will bring all of Israel to salvation! The prophecy will be fulfilled that says:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">For this is my covenant promise with them</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">Now, many of the Jews are opposed to the gospel, but their opposition has opened the door of the gospel to you who are not Jewish. Yet they are still greatly loved by God because their ancestors were divinely chosen to be his.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">And when God chooses someone and graciously imparts gifts to him, they are never rescinded.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">You who are not Jews were once rebels against God, but now, because of their disobedience, you have experienced God&amp;quot;s tender mercies.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">And now they are the rebels, and because of God&amp;quot;s tender mercies to you, you can open the door to them to share in and enjoy what God has given to us!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">Actually, God considers all of humanity to be prisoners of their unbelief, so that he can unlock our hearts and show his tender mercies to all who come to him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">Who could ever wrap their minds around the riches of God, the depth of his wisdom, and the marvel of his perfect knowledge? Who could ever explain the wonder of his decisions or search out the mysterious way he carries out his plans?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">For who has discovered how the Lord thinks</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">Or:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">For out of him, the sustainer of everything, came everything, and now everything finds fulfillment in him. May all praise and honor be given to him forever! Amen!</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="12">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Beloved friends, what should be our proper response to God&amp;quot;s marvelous mercies? To surrender yourselves to God to be his sacred, living sacrifices. And live in holiness, experiencing all that delights his heart. For this becomes your genuine expression of worship.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Stop imitating the ideals and opinions of the culture around you, but be inwardly transformed by the Holy Spirit through a total reformation of how you think. This will empower you to discern God&amp;quot;s will as you live a beautiful life, satisfying and perfect in his eyes.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">God has given me grace to speak a warning about pride. I would ask each of you to be emptied of self-promotion and not create a false image of your importance. Instead, honestly assess your worth by using your God-given faith as the standard of measurement, and then you will see your true value with an appropriate self-esteem.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">In the human body there are many parts and organs, each with a unique function.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">And so it is in the body of Christ. For though we are many, we&amp;quot;ve all been mingled into one body in Christ. This means that we are all vitally joined to one another, with each contributing to the others.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">God&amp;quot;s marvelous grace imparts to each one of us varying gifts. So if God has given you the grace-gift of prophecy, activate your gift by using the proportion of faith you have to prophesy.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">If your grace-gift is serving, then thrive in serving others well. If you have the grace-gift of teaching, then be actively teaching and training others.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">If you have the grace-gift of encouragement, then use it often to encourage others. If you have the grace-gift of giving to meet the needs of others, then may you prosper in your generosity without any fanfare. If you have the gift of leadership, be passionate about your leadership. And if you have the gift of showing compassion, then flourish in your cheerful display of compassion.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Let the inner movement of your heart always be to love one another, and never play the role of an actor wearing a mask. Despise evil and embrace everything that is good and virtuous.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Be devoted to tenderly loving your fellow believers as members of one family . Try to outdo yourselves in respect and honor of one another.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Be enthusiastic to serve the Lord, keeping your passion toward him boiling hot! Radiate with the glow of the Holy Spirit and let him fill you with excitement as you serve him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Let this hope burst forth within you, releasing a continual joy. Don&amp;quot;t give up in a time of trouble, but commune with God at all times.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Take a constant interest in the needs of God&amp;quot;s beloved people and respond by helping them. And eagerly welcome people as guests into your home.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Speak blessing, not cursing, over those who reject and persecute you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Celebrate with those who celebrate, and weep with those who grieve.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Live happily together in a spirit of harmony, and be as mindful of another&amp;quot;s worth as you are your own. Don&amp;quot;t live with a lofty mind-set, thinking you are too important to serve others, but be willing to do menial tasks and identify with those who are humble minded. Don&amp;quot;t be smug or even think for a moment that you know it all.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Never hold a grudge or try to get even, but plan your life around the noblest way to benefit others.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Do your best to live as everybody&amp;quot;s friend.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Beloved, don&amp;quot;t be obsessed with taking revenge, but leave that to God&amp;quot;s righteous justice. For the Scriptures say: &amp;apos;Vengeance is mine, and I will repay,&amp;apos; says the Lord. Win him over with kindness. and God will reward you with favor.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">And: If your enemy is hungry, buy him lunch! For your surprising generosity will awaken his conscience,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Never let evil defeat you, but defeat evil with good.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="13">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Every person must submit to and support the authorities over him. For there can be no authority in the universe except by God&amp;quot;s appointment, which means that every authority that exists has been instituted by God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">So to resist authority is to resist the divine order of God, which results in severe consequences.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">For civil authorities don&amp;quot;t intimidate those who are doing good, but those who are doing evil. So do what is right and you&amp;quot;ll never need to fear those in authority. They will commend you for your good citizenship.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Those in authority are God&amp;quot;s servants for the good of society. But if you break the law, you have reason to be alarmed, for they are God&amp;quot;s agents of punishment to bring criminals to justice. Why do you think they carry weapons?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">You are compelled to obey them, not just to avoid punishment, but because you want to live with a clean conscience.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">This is also the reason you pay your taxes, for governmental authorities are God&amp;quot;s officials who oversee these things.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">So it is your duty to pay all the taxes and fees that they require and to respect those who are worthy of respect, honoring them accordingly.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Don&amp;quot;t owe anything to anyone, except your outstanding debt to continually love one another, for the one who learns to love has fulfilled every requirement of the law.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">For the commandments, &amp;apos;Do not commit adultery, do not murder, do not steal, do not covet,&amp;apos; and every other commandment can be summed up in these words: &amp;apos;Love and value others the same way you love and value yourself.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Love makes it impossible to harm another, so love fulfills all that the law requires.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">To live like this is all the more urgent, for time is running out and you know it is a strategic hour in human history. It is time for us to wake up! For our full salvation is nearer now than when we first believed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Night&amp;quot;s darkness is dissolving away as a new day of destiny dawns. So we must once and for all strip away what is done in the shadows of darkness, removing it like filthy clothes . And once and for all we clothe ourselves with the radiance of light as our weapon.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">We must live honorably, surrounded by the light of this new day, not in the darkness of drunkenness and debauchery, not in promiscuity and sensuality, not being argumentative or jealous of others.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Instead fully immerse yourselves into the Lord Jesus, the Anointed One, and don&amp;quot;t waste even a moment&amp;quot;s thought on your former identity to awaken its selfish desires.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="14">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Offer an open hand of fellowship to welcome every true believer, even though their faith may be weak and immature. And refuse to engage in debates with them concerning nothing more than opinions.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">For example, one believer has no problem with eating all kinds of food, but another with weaker faith will eat only vegetables.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">The one who eats freely shouldn&amp;quot;t judge and look down on the one who eats only vegetables. And the vegetarian must not judge and look down on the one who eats everything. Remember, God has welcomed him and taken him as his partner.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Who do you think you are to sit in judgment of someone else&amp;quot;s household servant? His own master is the one to evaluate whether he succeeds or fails. And God&amp;quot;s servants will succeed, for God&amp;quot;s power supports them and enables them to stand.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">In the same way, one person regards a certain day as more sacred than another, and another person regards them all alike. There is nothing wrong with having different personal convictions about such matters.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">For the person who observes one day as especially sacred does it to honor the Lord. And the same is true regarding what a person eats. The one who eats everything eats to honor the Lord, because he gives thanks to God, and the one who has a special diet does it to honor the Lord, and he also gives thanks to God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">No one lives to himself and no one dies to himself.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">While we live, we must live for our Master, and in death we must bring honor to him. So dead or alive we belong to our Master.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">For this very reason the Anointed One died and was brought back to life again, so that he would become the Lord God over both the dead and the living.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Why would you judge your brothers or sisters because of their diet, despising them for what they eat or don&amp;quot;t eat? For we each will have our turn to stand before God&amp;quot;s judgment seat.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Just as it is written: &amp;apos;As surely as I am the Living God, I tell you: &amp;quot;Every knee will bow before me and every tongue will confess the truth and glorify me!&amp;quot; &amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Therefore, each one must answer for himself and give a personal account of his own life before God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">So stop being critical and condemning of other believers, but instead determine to never deliberately cause a brother or sister to stumble and fall because of your actions.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">I know and am convinced by personal revelation from the Lord Jesus that there is nothing wrong with eating any food. But to the one who considers it to be unclean, it is unacceptable.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">If your brother or sister is offended because you insist on eating what you want, it is no longer love that rules your conduct. Why would you wound someone for whom the Messiah gave his life, just so you can eat what you want?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">So don&amp;quot;t give people the opportunity to slander what you know to be good.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">For the kingdom of God is not a matter of rules about food and drink, but is in the realm of the Holy Spirit, filled with righteousness, peace, and joy.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Serving the Anointed One by walking in these kingdom realities pleases God and earns the respect of others.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">So then, make it your top priority to live a life of peace with harmony in your relationships, eagerly seeking to strengthen and encourage one another.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Stop ruining the work of God by insisting on your own opinions about food. You can eat anything you want, but it is wrong to deliberately cause someone to be offended over what you eat.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Consider it an act of love to refrain from eating meat or drinking wine or doing anything else that would cause a fellow believer to be offended or tempted to be weakened in his faith.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Keep the convictions you have about these matters between yourself and God, and don&amp;quot;t impose them upon others . You&amp;quot;ll be happy when you don&amp;quot;t judge yourself in doing what your conscience approves.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">But the one who has misgivings feels miserable if he eats meat, because he doubts and doesn&amp;quot;t eat in faith. For anything we do that doesn&amp;quot;t spring from faith is, by definition, sinful.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="15">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Now, those who are mature in their faith can easily be recognized, for they don&amp;quot;t live to please themselves but have learned to patiently embrace others in their immaturity.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Our goal must be to empower others to do what is right and good for them, and to bring them into spiritual maturity.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">For not even the most powerful one of all , the Anointed One, lived to please himself. His life fulfilled the Scripture that says: All the insults of those who insulted you fall upon me. and they will hear me sing praises to your name. celebrate life right alongside his Jewish people.&amp;apos; raise their voices in praises to him. &amp;apos;An heir to David&amp;quot;s throne will emerge, for all their hopes will be met in him.&amp;apos; and those who have not heard will understand.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Whatever was written beforehand is meant to instruct us in how to live. The Scriptures impart to us encouragement and inspiration so that we can live in hope and endure all things.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Now may God, the source of great endurance and comfort, grace you with unity among yourselves, which flows from your relationship with Jesus, the Anointed One.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Then, with a unanimous rush of passion, you will with one voice glorify God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">You will bring God glory when you accept and welcome one another as partners, just as the Anointed One has fully accepted you and received you as his partner.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">I am convinced that Jesus, the Messiah, was sent as a servant to the Jewish people to fulfill the promises God made to our ancestors and to prove God&amp;quot;s faithfulness.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">And now, because of Jesus, the non-Jewish people of the world can glorify God for his kindness to them, fulfilling the prophecy of Scripture: Because of this I will proclaim you among the nations &amp;apos;You who are not Jewish, Praise the Lord, all you who are not Jews, and let all the people of the earth and he will rise up as ruler over all the non-Jewish nations, Those who know nothing about him will clearly see him,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">And in another place it says:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">And again:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">And Isaiah prophesied:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Now may God, the fountain of hope, fill you to overflowing with uncontainable joy and perfect peace as you trust in him. And may the power of the Holy Spirit continually surround your life with his super-abundance until you radiate with hope!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">My dear brothers and sisters, I am fully convinced of your genuine spirituality. I know that each of you is stuffed full of God&amp;quot;s goodness, that you are richly supplied with all kinds of revelation-knowledge, and that you are empowered to effectively instruct one another.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">And because of the outpouring of God&amp;quot;s grace on my life to be his minister and to preach Jesus, the Anointed One, to the non-Jewish people, I have written rather boldly to you on some themes, reminding you of their importance.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">For this grace has made me a servant of the gospel of God, constantly doing the work of a priest, for I endeavor to present an acceptable offering to God; so that the non-Jewish people of the earth may be set apart and made holy by the Spirit of holiness.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Now then, it is through my union with Jesus Christ, that I enjoy an enthusiasm and confidence in my ministry for God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">It is my honor and constant passion to be a pioneer who preaches where no one has ever even heard of the Anointed One, instead of building upon someone else&amp;quot;s foundation.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">As the Scriptures say:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">My pursuit of this mission has prevented me many times from visiting you,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">but there is now nothing left to keep me in these regions. So many years I have longed to come and be with you!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">So on my way to Spain I hope to visit you as I pass through Rome. And after I have enjoyed fellowship with you for a while, I hope that you would help me financially on my journey.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">But now I&amp;quot;m on my way to Jerusalem to encourage God&amp;quot;s people and minister to them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">I am pleased to inform you that the believers of Macedonia and Greece have made a generous contribution for the poor among the holy believers in Jerusalem.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">They were thrilled to have an opportunity to give back to the believers in Jerusalem. For indeed, they are deeply grateful for them and feel indebted because they brought them the gospel. Since the ethnic multitudes have shared in the spiritual wealth of the Jewish people, it is only right that the non-Jewish people share their material wealth with them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">So, when I have completed this act of worship and safely delivered the offering to them in Jerusalem, I will set out for Spain and visit you on my way there.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">I am convinced that when I come to you, I will come packed full and loaded with the blessings of the Anointed One!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">That&amp;quot;s why I plead with you, because of our union with our Lord Jesus Christ, to be partners with me in your prayers to God. My dear brothers and sisters in the faith, with the love we share in the Holy Spirit, fight alongside me in prayer.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">Ask the Father to deliver me from the danger I face from the unbelievers in Judea. For I want to make sure that the contribution I carry for Jerusalem will be favorably received by God&amp;quot;s holy ones.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">Then he will send me to you with great joy in the pleasure of God&amp;quot;s will, and I will be spiritually refreshed by your fellowship.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">And now may the God who gives us his peace and wholeness be with you all. Yes, Lord, so let it be!</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1">Now, let me introduce to you our dear and beloved sister in the faith, Phoebe, a shining minister of the church in Cenchrea.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">I am sending her with this letter and ask that you shower her with your hospitality when she arrives. Embrace her with honor, as is fitting for one who belongs to the Lord and is set apart for him. So provide her whatever she may need, for she&amp;quot;s been a great leader and champion for many&amp;ndash;I know, for she&amp;quot;s been that for even me!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Give my love to Prisca and Aquila, my partners in ministry serving the Anointed One, Jesus,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">for they&amp;quot;ve risked their own lives to save mine. I&amp;quot;m so thankful for them, and not just I, but all the congregations among the non-Jewish people respect them for their ministry.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Also give my loving greetings to all the believers in their house church. And greet Epenetus, who was the first convert to Christ in the Roman province of Asia, for I love him dearly. And extend warm greetings to all those of Aristobolos&amp;quot;s house church. To Persis, who is much loved and faithful in her ministry for the Lord, I send my greetings. (Paul&amp;quot;s letter was transcribed by Tertius in Corinth and sent from Corinth and carried to Rome by Phoebe.)</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">And give my greetings to Miriam, who has toiled and labored extremely hard to benefit you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Make sure that my relatives Andronicus and Junia are honored, for they&amp;quot;re my fellow captives who bear the distinctive mark of being outstanding and well-known apostles, and who were joined into the Anointed One before me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Give my regards to Ampliatus, whom I love, for he is joined into the Lord.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">And give my loving greetings to Urbanus, our partner in ministry serving the Anointed One, and also to Stachus, whom I love.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Don&amp;quot;t forget to greet Apelles for me, for he&amp;quot;s been tested and found to be approved by the Anointed One.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Give my love to my relative Herodion, and also to all those of the house church of Narcissus, for they too are joined into the Lord.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Please greet Tryphena and Tryphosa, for they are women who have diligently served the Lord.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">And Rufus, for he is especially chosen by the Lord. And I greet his mother, who was like a mother to me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">I cannot forget to mention my esteemed friends Asyncritus, Phlegon, Hermes, Patrobas, Hermas, and all the brothers and sisters who meet with them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Give my regards to Philologus, Julia, Nereus and his sister, and also Olympas and all the holy believers who meet with them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Greet each other with a holy kiss of God&amp;quot;s love . All the believers in all the congregations of the Messiah send their greetings to all of you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">And now, dear brothers and sisters, I&amp;quot;d like to give one final word of caution: Watch out for those who cause divisions and offenses among you. When they antagonize you by speaking of things that are contrary to the teachings that you&amp;quot;ve received, don&amp;quot;t be caught in their snare!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">For people like this are not truly serving the Lord, our Messiah, but are being driven by their own desires for a following. Utilizing their smooth words and well-rehearsed blessings, they seek to deceive the hearts of innocent ones.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">I&amp;quot;m so happy when I think of you, because everyone knows the testimony of your deep commitment of faith. So I want you to become scholars of all that is good and beautiful, and stay pure and innocent when it comes to evil.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">And the God of peace will swiftly pound Satan to a pulp under your feet! And the wonderful favor of our Lord Jesus will surround you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">My ministry partner, Timothy, sends his loving greetings, along with Luke, Jason, and Sosipater, my Jewish kinsmen.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">(I, Tertius, am the one transcribing this letter for Paul, and I too send my greetings to all of you, as a follower of the Lord.)</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">My kind host here in Corinth, Gaius, likewise greets you, along with the entire congregation of his house church. Also, the city administrator Erastus and our brother Quartus send their warm greetings.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">May the grace and favor of our Lord Jesus, the Anointed One, continually rest upon you all.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">I give all my praises and glory to the one who has more than enough power to make you strong and keep you steadfast through the promises found in my gospel; that is, the proclamation of Jesus, the Anointed One. This wonderful news includes the unveiling of the mystery kept secret from the dawn of creation until now.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">This mystery is understood through the prophecies of the Scripture and by the decree of the eternal God. And it is now heard openly by all the nations, igniting within them a deep commitment of faith.</VERS>

And God has invited you to be his devoted and holy people, and not only you, but everyone everywhere who calls on the name of our Lord Jesus Christ as their Lord, and ours also.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">May joyous grace and endless peace be yours continually from our Father God and from our Lord Jesus, the Anointed One!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">I am always thanking my God for you because he has given you such free and open access to his grace through your union with Jesus, the Messiah.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">In him you have been made extravagantly rich in every way. You have been endowed with a wealth of inspired utterance and the riches that come from your intimate knowledge of him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">For the reality of the truth of Christ is seen among you and strengthened through your experience of him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">So now you aren&amp;quot;t lacking any spiritual gift as you eagerly await the unveiling of the Lord Jesus, the Anointed One.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">He will keep you steady and strong to the very end, making your character mature so that you will be found innocent on the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">God is forever faithful and can be trusted to do this in you, for he has invited you to co-share the life of his Son, Jesus, the Anointed One, our King!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">I urge you, my brothers and sisters, for the sake of the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, to agree to live in unity with one another and put to rest any division that attempts to tear you apart. Be restored as one united body living in perfect harmony. Form a consistent choreography among yourselves, having a common perspective with shared values.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">My dear brothers and sisters, I have a serious concern I need to bring up with you , for I have been informed by those of Chloe&amp;quot;s house church that you have been destructively arguing among yourselves.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">And I need to bring this up because each of you is claiming loyalty to different preachers. Some are saying, &amp;apos;I am a disciple of Paul,&amp;apos; or, &amp;apos;I follow Apollos,&amp;apos; or, &amp;apos;I am a disciple of Peter the Rock,&amp;apos; and some, &amp;apos;I belong only to Christ.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">But let me ask you , is Christ divided up into groups? Did I die on the cross for you? At your baptism did you pledge yourselves to follow Paul?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Thank God I only baptized two from Corinth&amp;ndash;Crispus and Gaius!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">So now no one can say that in my name I baptized others.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">(Yes, I also baptized Stephanus and his family. Other than that, I don&amp;quot;t remember baptizing anyone else.)</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">For the Anointed One has sent me on a mission, not to see how many I could baptize, but to proclaim the good news. And I declare this message stripped of all philosophical arguments that empty the cross of its true power. For I trust in the all-sufficient cross of Christ alone.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">To preach the message of the cross seems like sheer nonsense to those who are on their way to destruction, but to us who are being saved, it is the mighty power of God released within us.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">For it is written: I will dismantle the wisdom of the wise If anyone boasts, let him only boast and I will invalidate the intelligence of the scholars. in all that the Lord has done!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">So where is the wise philosopher who understands ? Where is the expert scholar who comprehends ? And where is the skilled debater of our time who could win a debate with God ? Hasn&amp;quot;t God demonstrated that the wisdom of this world system is utter foolishness?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">For in his wisdom, God designed that all the world&amp;quot;s wisdom would be insufficient to lead people to the discovery of himself. He took great delight in baffling the wisdom of the world by using the simplicity of preaching the story of the cross in order to save those who believe it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">For the Jews constantly demand to see miraculous signs, while those who are not Jews constantly cling to the world&amp;quot;s wisdom,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">but we preach the crucified Messiah. The Jews stumble over him and the rest of the world sees him as foolishness.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">But for those who have been chosen to follow him, both Jews and Greeks, he is God&amp;quot;s mighty power, God&amp;quot;s true wisdom, and our Messiah.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">For the &amp;apos;foolish&amp;apos; things of God have proven to be wiser than human wisdom. And the &amp;apos;feeble&amp;apos; things of God have proven to be far more powerful than any human ability.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">Brothers and sisters, consider who you were when God called you to salvation . Not many of you were wise scholars by human standards, nor were many of you in positions of power. Not many of you were considered the elite when you answered God&amp;quot;s call .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">But God chose those whom the world considers foolish to shame those who think they are wise, and God chose the puny and powerless to shame the high and mighty.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">He chose the lowly, the laughable in the world&amp;quot;s eyes&amp;ndash;nobodies&amp;ndash;so that he would shame the somebodies. For he chose what is regarded as insignificant in order to supersede what is regarded as prominent,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">so that there would be no place for prideful boasting in God&amp;quot;s presence.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">For it is not from man that we draw our life but from God as we are being joined to Jesus, the Anointed One. And now he is our God-given wisdom, our virtue, our holiness, and our redemption.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">And this fulfills what is written:</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="2">
			<VERS vnumber="1">My brothers and sisters, when I first came to proclaim to you the secrets of God, I refused to come as an expert , trying to impress you with my eloquent speech and lofty wisdom.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">For while I was with you I was determined to be consumed with one topic&amp;ndash;Jesus, the crucified Messiah.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">I stood before you feeling inadequate, filled with reverence for God, and trembling under the sense of the importance of my words .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">The message I preached and how I preached it was not an attempt to sway you with persuasive arguments but to prove to you the almighty power of God&amp;quot;s Holy Spirit.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">For God intended that your faith not be established on man&amp;quot;s wisdom but by trusting in his almighty power.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">However, there is a wisdom that we continually speak of when we are among the spiritually mature. It&amp;quot;s wisdom that didn&amp;quot;t originate in this present age, nor did it come from the rulers of this age who are in the process of being dethroned.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Instead, we continually speak of this wonderful wisdom that comes from God, hidden before now in a mystery. It is his secret plan, destined before the ages, to bring us into glory.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">None of the rulers of this present world order understood it, for if they had, they never would have crucified the Lord of shining glory.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">This is why the Scriptures say: Things never discovered or heard of before, these are the many things God has in store things beyond our ability to imagine &amp;ndash; for all his lovers. Who has ever intimately known the mind of the Lord Yahweh well enough to become his counselor? Christ has , and we possess Christ&amp;quot;s perceptions.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">But God now unveils these profound realities to us by the Spirit. Yes, he has revealed to us his inmost heart and deepest mysteries through the Holy Spirit, who constantly explores all things.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">After all, who can really see into a person&amp;quot;s heart and know his hidden impulses except for that person&amp;quot;s spirit? So it is with God. His thoughts and secrets are only fully understood by his Spirit, the Spirit of God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">For we did not receive the spirit of this world system but the Spirit of God, so that we might come to understand and experience all that grace has lavished upon us.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">And we articulate these realities with the words imparted to us by the Spirit and not with the words taught by human wisdom. We join together Spirit-revealed truths with Spirit-revealed words.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Someone living on an entirely human level rejects the revelations of God&amp;quot;s Spirit, for they make no sense to him. He can&amp;quot;t understand the revelations of the Spirit because they are only discovered by the illumination of the Spirit.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Those who live in the Spirit are able to carefully evaluate all things, and they are subject to the scrutiny of no one but God .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">For</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="3">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Brothers and sisters, when I was with you I found it impossible to speak to you as those who are spiritually mature people, for you are still dominated by the mind-set of the flesh. And because you are immature infants in Christ,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">I had to nurse you and feed you with &amp;apos;milk,&amp;apos; not with the solid food of more advanced teachings , because you weren&amp;quot;t ready for it. In fact, you are still not ready to be fed solid food,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">for you are living your lives dominated by the mind-set of the flesh. Ask yourselves: Is there jealousy among you? Do you compare yourselves with others? Do you quarrel like children and end up taking sides? If so, this proves that you are living your lives centered on yourselves, dominated by the mind-set of the flesh, and behaving like unbelievers.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">For when you divide yourselves up in groups&amp;ndash;a &amp;apos;Paul group&amp;apos; and an &amp;apos;Apollos group&amp;apos; &amp;ndash;you&amp;quot;re acting like people without the Spirit&amp;quot;s influence.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Who is Apollos, really? Or who is Paul? Aren&amp;quot;t we both just servants through whom you believed our message? Aren&amp;quot;t each of us doing the ministry the Lord has assigned to us?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">I planted the church, and Apollos came and cared for it, but it was God who caused it to grow.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">This means the one who plants is not anybody special, nor the one who waters, for God is the one who brings the supernatural growth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Now, the one who plants and the one who waters are equally important and on the same team, but each will be rewarded for his own work.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">We are coworkers with God and you are God&amp;quot;s cultivated garden, the house he is building.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">God has given me unique gifts as a skilled master builder who lays a good foundation. Afterward another craftsman comes and builds on it. So builders beware! Let every builder do his work carefully, according to God&amp;quot;s standards.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">For no one is empowered to lay an alternative foundation other than the good foundation that exists, which is Jesus Christ!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">If his work stands the test of fire, he will be rewarded.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">If his work is consumed by the fire, he will suffer great loss. Yet he himself will barely escape destruction, like one being rescued out of a burning house.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Don&amp;quot;t you realize that together you have become God&amp;quot;s inner sanctuary and that the Spirit of God makes his permanent home in you?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Now, if someone desecrates God&amp;quot;s inner sanctuary, God will desecrate him, for God&amp;quot;s inner sanctuary is holy, and that is exactly who you are.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">So why fool yourself and live under an illusion? Make no mistake about it, if anyone thinks he is wise by the world&amp;quot;s standards, he will be made wiser by being a fool for God!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">For what the world says is wisdom is actually foolishness in God&amp;quot;s eyes. As it is written: The cleverness of the know-it-alls The Lord sees right through the clever reasonings of the wise becomes the trap that ensnares them. and knows that it&amp;quot;s all a sham.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">And again:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">So don&amp;quot;t be proud of your allegiance to any human leader. For actually, you already have everything! It has all been given for your benefit,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">whether it is Paul or Apollos or Peter the Rock, or whether it&amp;quot;s the world or life or death, or whether it&amp;quot;s the present or the future&amp;ndash;everything belongs to you!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">And now you are joined to the Messiah, who is joined to God.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="4">
			<VERS vnumber="1">So then you must perceive us&amp;ndash; not as leaders of factions , but as servants of the Anointed One, those who have been entrusted with God&amp;quot;s mysteries.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">The most important quality of one entrusted with such secrets is that they are faithful and trustworthy.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">But personally, I&amp;quot;m not the least bit concerned if I&amp;quot;m judged by you or any verdict I receive from any human court. In fact, I don&amp;quot;t even assume to be my own judge,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">even though my conscience is clear. But that doesn&amp;quot;t mean I stand acquitted before the Lord, for the only judge I care about is him!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">So resist the temptation to pronounce premature judgment on anything before the appointed time when all will be fully revealed . Instead, wait until the Lord makes his appearance, for he will bring all that is hidden in darkness to light and unveil every secret motive of everyone&amp;quot;s heart. Then, when the whole truth is known , each will receive praise from God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Dear brothers and sisters, I&amp;quot;ve been referring allusively to myself and Apollos in order to illustrate what I&amp;quot;ve been saying. It is futile to move beyond what is written in the Scriptures and be inflated with self-importance by following and promoting one leader in competition with another.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">For what makes a distinction between you and someone else? And what do you have that grace has not given you? And if you received it as a gift , why do you boast as though there is something special about you?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Oh, I know, you already have all you need! Since when did you become so content and rich without us? You&amp;quot;ve already crowned yourselves as royalty, reigning on your thrones, leaving us lowly apostles far behind! How I wish indeed that you really were reigning as kings already, for that would mean we would be reigning as kings alongside of you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">It seems to me that God has appointed us apostles to be at the end of the line. We are like those on display at the end of the procession, as doomed gladiators soon to be killed. We have become a theatrical spectacle to all creation, both to people and to angels.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">We are fools for Christ, but you are wise in Christ! We are the frail; you are the powerful. You are celebrated; we are humiliated.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">If you could see us now, you&amp;quot;d find that we are hungry and thirsty, poorly clothed, brutally treated, and with no roof over our heads.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">We work hard, toiling with our own hands. When people abuse and insult us, we respond with a blessing, and when severely persecuted, we endure it with patience.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">When we are slandered incessantly, we always answer gently, ready to reconcile. Even now, in the world&amp;quot;s opinion, we are nothing but filth and the lowest scum.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">I&amp;quot;m not writing this to embarrass you or to shame you, but to correct you as the children I love.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">For although you could have countless babysitters in Christ telling you what you&amp;quot;re doing wrong , you don&amp;quot;t have many fathers who correct you in love . But I&amp;quot;m a true father to you, for I became your father when I gave you the gospel and brought you into union with Jesus, the Anointed One.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">So I encourage you, my children, to follow the example that I live before you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">That&amp;quot;s why I&amp;quot;ve sent my dear son Timothy, whom I love. He is faithful to the Lord Yahweh and will remind you of how I conduct myself as one who lives in union with Jesus, the Anointed One, and of the teachings that I bring to every church everywhere.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">There are some among you who have exalted themselves as if I were not coming back to you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">But I will come soon, if it pleases the Lord, and I will find out not only what these arrogant ones are saying, but also if they have power to back up their words!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">For the kingdom realm of God comes with power, not simply impressive words.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">So which would you prefer? Shall I come carrying the rod of authority to discipline or with an embrace in love with a gentle spirit?</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="5">
			<VERS vnumber="3">Even though I am physically far away from you, my spirit is present with you. And as one who is present with you, I have already evaluated and judged the perpetrator.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">So call a meeting , and when you gather together in the name of our Lord Jesus, and you know my spirit is present with you in the infinite power of our Lord Jesus,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">release this man over to Satan for the destruction of his rebellious flesh, in hope that his spirit may be rescued and restored in the day of the Lord.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Boasting over your tolerance of sin is inappropriate. Don&amp;quot;t you understand that even a small compromise with sin permeates the entire fellowship, just as a little leaven permeates a batch of dough?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">So remove every trace of your &amp;apos;leaven&amp;apos; of compromise with sin so that you might become new and pure again. For indeed, you are clean because Christ, our Passover Lamb, has been sacrificed for us.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">So now we can celebrate our continual feast, not with the old &amp;apos;leaven,&amp;apos; the yeast of wickedness or bitterness, but we will feast on the freshly baked bread of innocence and holiness.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">I wrote you in my previous letter asking you not to associate with those who practice sexual immorality.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Yet in no way was I referring to avoiding contact with unbelievers who are immoral, or greedy, or swindlers, or those who worship other gods&amp;ndash;for that would mean you&amp;quot;d have to isolate yourself from the world entirely!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">But now I&amp;quot;m writing to you so that you would exclude from your fellowship anyone who calls himself a fellow believer and practices sexual immorality, or is consumed with greed, or is an idolater, or is verbally abusive or a drunkard or a swindler. Don&amp;quot;t mingle with them or even have a meal with someone like that.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="6">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Furthermore, how dare you take a fellow believer to court! It is wrong to drag him before the unrighteous to settle a legal dispute. Isn&amp;quot;t it better to take him before God&amp;quot;s holy believers to settle the matter?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Don&amp;quot;t you realize that we, the holy ones, will judge the universe? If the unbelieving world is under your jurisdiction, you should be fully competent to settle these trivial lawsuits among yourselves.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">For surely you know that we will one day judge angels, let alone these everyday matters.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Don&amp;quot;t you realize that you are bringing your issues before civil judges appointed by people who have no standing within the church?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">What a shame that there is not one within the church who has the spirit of wisdom who could arbitrate these disputes and reconcile the offended parties!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">It&amp;quot;s not right for a believer to sue a fellow believer&amp;ndash;and especially to bring it before the unbelievers.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Don&amp;quot;t you realize that when you drag another believer into court you&amp;quot;re providing the evidence that you are already defeated? Wouldn&amp;quot;t it be better to accept the fact that someone is trying to cheat and take advantage of you, and simply choose the high road ? At times it is better to just accept injustice and even to let someone take advantage of you, rather than to expose our conflicts publicly before unbelievers .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">But instead you keep cheating and doing wrong to your brothers and sisters, and then request that unbelievers render their judgment !</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Surely you must know that people who practice evil cannot possess God&amp;quot;s kingdom realm. Stop being deceived! People who continue to engage in sexual immorality, idolatry, adultery, sexual perversion, homosexuality,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">fraud, greed, drunkenness, verbal abuse, or extortion&amp;ndash;these will not inherit God&amp;quot;s kingdom realm.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">It&amp;quot;s true that some of you once lived in those lifestyles, but now you have been purified from sin, made holy, and given a perfect standing before God&amp;ndash;all because of the power of the name of the Lord Jesus, the Messiah, and through our union with the Spirit of our God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">It&amp;quot;s true that our freedom allows us to do anything, but that doesn&amp;quot;t mean that everything we do is good for us. I&amp;quot;m free to do as I choose, but I choose to never be enslaved to anything.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Some have said, &amp;apos;I eat to live and I live to eat!&amp;apos; But God will do away with it all. The body was not created for illicit sex, but to serve and worship our Lord Jesus, who can fill the body with himself.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Now the God who raised up our Lord from the grave will awaken and raise us up through his mighty power!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Don&amp;quot;t you know that your bodies belong to Christ as his body parts? Should one presume to take the members of Christ&amp;quot;s body and make them into members of a harlot? Absolutely not!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Aren&amp;quot;t you aware of the fact that when anyone sleeps with a prostitute he becomes a part of her, and she becomes a part of him? For it has been declared: The two become a single body.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">But the one who joins himself to the Lord is mingled into one spirit with him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">This is why you must keep running away from sexual immorality. For every other sin a person commits is external to the body, but immorality involves sinning against your own body.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Have you forgotten that your body is now the sacred temple of the Spirit of Holiness, who lives in you? You don&amp;quot;t belong to yourself any longer, for the gift of God, the Holy Spirit, lives inside your sanctuary.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">You were God&amp;quot;s expensive purchase, paid for with tears of blood, so by all means, then, use your body to bring glory to God!</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="7">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Now for my response concerning the issues you&amp;quot;ve asked me to address. You wrote saying , &amp;apos;It is proper for a man to live in celibacy.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Perhaps. But because of the danger of immorality, each husband should have sexual intimacy with his wife and each wife should have sexual intimacy with her husband.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">A husband has the responsibility of meeting the sexual needs of his wife, and likewise a wife to her husband.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Neither the husband nor the wife have exclusive rights to their own bodies, but those rights are to be surrendered to the other.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">So don&amp;quot;t continue to refuse your spouse those rights, except perhaps by mutual agreement for a specified time so that you can both be devoted to prayer. And then you should resume your physical pleasure so that the Adversary cannot take advantage of you because of the desires of your body.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">I&amp;quot;m not giving you a divine command, but my godly advice.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">I would wish that all of you could live unmarried , just as I do. Yet I understand that we are all decidedly different, with each having a special grace for one thing or another.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">So let me say to the unmarried and those who have lost their spouses, it is fine for you to remain single as I am.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">But if you have no power over your passions, then you should go ahead and marry, for marriage is far better than a continual battle with lust.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">And to those who are married, I give this charge&amp;ndash;which is not mine, but the Lord&amp;quot;s &amp;ndash;that the wife should not depart from her husband.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">But if she does, then she should either remain unmarried or reconcile with her husband. And a husband must not divorce his wife.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">To the rest I say, which is not a saying of the Lord, if a brother has an unbelieving wife and she is content to live with him, he should not divorce her.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">And if a woman has a husband who is not a believer and he is content to live with her, she should not divorce him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">For the unbelieving husband has been made holy by his believing wife. And the unbelieving wife has been made holy by her believing husband by virtue of his or her sacred union to a believer . Otherwise, the children from this union would be unclean, but in fact, they are holy.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">But if the unbelieving spouse wants a divorce, then let it be so. In this situation the believing spouse is not bound to the marriage , for God has called us to live in peace.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">And wives, for all you know you could one day lead your husband to salvation. Or husbands, how do you know for sure that you could not one day lead your wife to salvation?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">May all believers continue to live the wonderful lives God has called them to live, according to what he assigns for each person, for this is what I teach to believers everywhere.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">If when you were called to follow Jesus you were circumcised, it would be futile to try to undo the circumcision. And if you were called while yet uncircumcised, there is no need to be circumcised.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Your identity before God has nothing to do with circumcision or uncircumcision. What really matters is following God&amp;quot;s commandments.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">So everyone should continue to live faithful in the situation of life in which they were called to follow Jesus .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Were you a slave when you heard the call to follow Jesus ? Don&amp;quot;t let that concern you. Even if you can gain your freedom, make the most of the opportunity.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">For truly, if you are called to a life-union with the Lord, you are already a free man! And those who were called to follow Jesus when they were free are now the Messiah&amp;quot;s slaves.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">Since a great price was paid for your redemption, stop having the mind-set of a slave.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">Brothers and sisters, we must remain in close communion with God, no matter what our situation was when we were first called to follow Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">Now let me address the issue of singleness. I must confess, I have no command to give you that comes directly from the Lord. But let me share my thoughts on the matter, as coming from one who has experienced the mercy of the Lord to keep me faithful to him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">Because of the severe pressure we are in, I recommend you remain as you are.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">If you are married, stay in the marriage. If you are single, don&amp;quot;t rush into marriage.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">But if you do get married, you haven&amp;quot;t sinned. It&amp;quot;s just that I would want to spare you the problems you&amp;quot;ll face with the extra challenges of being married.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">My friends, what I mean is this. The urgency of our times mean that from now on, those who have wives should live as though without them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">And those who weep should forget their tears. And those who rejoice will have no time to celebrate. And those who purchase items will have no time to enjoy them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">We are to live as those who live in the world but are not absorbed by it, for the world as we know it is quickly passing away.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">Because of this, we need to live as free from anxiety as possible. For a single man is focused on the things of the Lord and how he may please him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">But a married man is pulled in two directions, for he is concerned about both the things of God and the things of the world in order to please his wife.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">And the single woman is focused on the things of the Lord so she can be holy both in body and spirit. But a married woman is concerned about the things of the world and how she may please her husband.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">I am trying to help you and make things easier for you and not make things difficult, but so that you would have undistracted devotion, serving the Lord constantly with an undivided heart.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">However, if a man has decided to serve God as a single person, yet changes his mind and finds himself in love with a woman, although he never intended to marry, let him go ahead and marry her; it is not a sin to do so.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">On the other hand, if a man stands firm in his heart to remain single, and is under no compulsion to get married but has control over his passions and is determined to remain celibate, he has chosen well.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">So then, the one who marries his fiancÃ©e does well and the one who chooses not to marry her does better.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">A wife is bound by the marriage covenant as long as her husband is living. But if the husband dies, she is free to marry again as she desires&amp;ndash;but, of course, he should be a believer in the Lord.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">However, in my opinion (and I think that I too have the Spirit of God), she would be happier if she remained single.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="8">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Now let me address the issue of food offered in sacrifice to idols. It seems that everyone believes his own opinion is right on this matter. How easily we get puffed up over our opinions! But love builds up the structure of our new life .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">If anyone thinks of himself as a know-it-all, he still has a lot to learn.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">But if a person passionately loves God, he will possess the knowledge of God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Concerning food sacrificed as offerings to idols, we all know that an idol is nothing, for there is no God but one.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Although there may be many so-called gods in this world, and in heaven there may be many &amp;apos;gods,&amp;apos; &amp;apos;lords,&amp;apos; and &amp;apos;masters,&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">yet for us there is only one God&amp;ndash;the Father. Out of him is all things, and our lives are lived for him. And there is one Lord, Jesus, the Anointed One, through whom we and all things exist.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">But not everyone has this revelation. For some were formerly idolaters, who consider idols as real and living. That&amp;quot;s why they consider the food offered to that &amp;apos;god&amp;apos; as defiled. And their weak consciences become defiled if they eat it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Yes, we know that what you eat will not bring you closer to God. You are no better if you don&amp;quot;t eat certain foods and no better if you do.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">But you must be careful that the liberty you exercise in eating food offered to idols doesn&amp;quot;t offend the weak believers.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">For if a believer with a weak conscience sees you, who have a greater understanding, dining in an idol&amp;quot;s temple, won&amp;quot;t this be a temptation to him to violate his own conscience and eat food offered to idols?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">So, in effect, by exercising your understanding of freedom, you have ruined this weak believer, a brother for whom Christ has died!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">And when you offend weaker believers by wounding their consciences in this way, you also offend the Anointed One!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">So I conclude that if my eating certain food deeply offends my brother and hinders his advance in Christ, I will never eat it again. I don&amp;quot;t want to be guilty of causing my brother or sister to be wounded and defeated.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="9">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Am I not completely free and unrestrained? Absolutely! Am I not an apostle? Of course! Haven&amp;quot;t I had a personal encounter with our Jesus face-to-face&amp;ndash; and continue to see him ? Emphatically yes! Aren&amp;quot;t you all the proof of my ministry in the Lord? Certainly!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">If others do not recognize me as their apostle, at least you are bound to do so, for now your lives are joined to the Lord. You are the living proof , the certificate of my apostleship.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">So to those who want to continually criticize my apostolic ministry, here&amp;quot;s my statement of defense.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Don&amp;quot;t we apostles have the right to be supported financially?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Don&amp;quot;t we have the right to travel accompanied by our believing wives and be supported as a couple , as do the other apostles, such as Peter the Rock and the Lord&amp;quot;s brothers?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Of course we do! Or is it only Barnabas and I who have no right to stop working for a living?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Who serves in the military at his own expense? Who plants a vineyard and does not enjoy the grapes for himself? Who would nurture and shepherd a flock and never get to drink its fresh milk?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Am I merely giving you my own opinions, or does the Torah teach the same things?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">For it is written in the law of Moses: You should never put a muzzle over the mouth of an ox Tell me, is God only talking about oxen here? while he is treading out the grain. But as you know, we haven&amp;quot;t used that right. Instead, we have continued to support ourselves so that we would never be a hindrance to the spread of the gospel of Christ. Actually, I&amp;quot;d rather die than to have anyone rob me of this joyous reason for boasting!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Doesn&amp;quot;t he also give us this principle so that we won&amp;quot;t withhold support from his workers? It was written so that we would understand that the one spiritually &amp;apos;plowing&amp;apos; and spiritually &amp;apos;treading out the grain&amp;apos; also labors with the expectation of enjoying the harvest.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">So, if we&amp;quot;ve sowed many spiritual gifts among you, is it too much to expect to reap material gifts from you?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">And if you have supported others, don&amp;quot;t we rightfully deserve this privilege even more?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Don&amp;quot;t you know that the priests employed in sacred duty in the temple are provided for by temple resources? And the priests who serve at the altar receive a portion of the offerings?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">In the same way, the Lord has directed those who proclaim the gospel to receive their living by the gospel. As for me, I&amp;quot;ve preferred to never use any of these rights for myself.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">And keep in mind that I&amp;quot;m not writing all this because I&amp;quot;m hinting that you should support me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">For you see, even though I proclaim the good news, I can&amp;quot;t take the credit for my labors, for I am compelled to fulfill my duty by completing this work. It would be agony to me if I did not constantly preach the gospel!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">If it were my own idea to preach as a way to make a living, I would expect to be paid. Since it&amp;quot;s not my idea but God&amp;quot;s, who commissioned me, I am entrusted with the stewardship of the gospel whether or not I&amp;quot;m paid .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">So then, where is my reward? It is found in continually depositing the good news into people&amp;quot;s hearts , without obligation, free of charge, and not insisting on my rights to be financially supported.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Now, even though I am free from obligations to others, I joyfully make myself a servant to all in order to win as many converts as possible.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">I became Jewish to the Jewish people in order to win them to the Messiah . I became like one under the law to gain the people who were stuck under the law, even though I myself am not under the law.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">And to those who are without the Jewish laws, I became like them, as one without the Jewish laws, in order to win them, although I&amp;quot;m not outside the law of God but under the law of Christ.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">I became &amp;apos;weak&amp;apos; to the weak to win the weak. I have adapted to the culture of every place I&amp;quot;ve gone so that I could more easily win people to Christ.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">I&amp;quot;ve done all this so that I would become God&amp;quot;s partner for the sake of the gospel.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">Isn&amp;quot;t it obvious that all runners on the racetrack keep on running to win, but only one receives the victor&amp;quot;s prize? Yet each one of you must run the race to be victorious.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">A true athlete will be disciplined in every respect, practicing constant self-control in order to win a laurel wreath that quickly withers. But we run our race to win a victor&amp;quot;s crown that will last forever.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">For that reason, I don&amp;quot;t run just for exercise or box like one throwing aimless punches,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">but I train like a champion athlete. I subdue my body and get it under my control, so that after preaching the good news to others I myself won&amp;quot;t be disqualified.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="10">
			<VERS vnumber="1">My dear fellow believers, you need to understand that all of our Jewish ancestors who walked through a wilderness long ago were under the glory cloud and passed through the waters of the sea on both sides.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">They were all baptized into the cloud of glory, into the fellowship of Moses, and into the sea.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">They all ate the same heavenly manna</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">and drank water from the same spiritual rock that traveled with them&amp;ndash;and that Rock was Christ himself.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Yet God was not pleased with most of them, and their dead bodies were scattered around the wilderness.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Now, all these things serve as types and pictures for us&amp;ndash;lessons that teach us not to fail in the same way by callously craving worthless things</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">and practicing idolatry, as some of them did. For it is written: The people settled in to their unrestrained revelry, with feasting and drinking, then they rose up and became wildly out of control!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Neither should we commit sexual immorality, as some of them did, which caused the death of twenty-three thousand on a single day.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Nor should we ever provoke the Lord, as some of them did by putting him to outrageous tests that resulted in their death from snakebites day after day.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">And we must not embrace their ways by complaining&amp;ndash;grumbling with discontent, as many of them did, and were killed by the destroyer!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">All the tests they endured on their way through the wilderness are a symbolic picture, an example that provides us with a warning so that we can learn through what they experienced. For we live in a time when the purpose of all the ages past is now completing its goal within us.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">So beware if you think it could never happen to you, lest your pride becomes your downfall.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">We all experience times of testing, which is normal for every human being. But God will be faithful to you. He will screen and filter the severity, nature, and timing of every test or trial you face so that you can bear it. And each test is an opportunity to trust him more, for along with every trial God has provided for you a way of escape that will bring you out of it victoriously.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">My cherished friends, keep on running far away from idolatry.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">I know I am writing to thoughtful people, so carefully consider what I say.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">For when we pray for the blessing of the communion cup, isn&amp;quot;t this our co-participation with the blood of Jesus? And the bread that we distribute, isn&amp;quot;t this the bread of our co-participation with the body of Christ?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">For although we&amp;quot;re many, we become one loaf of bread and one body as we feast together on one loaf.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Consider the people of Israel when they fell into idolatry . When they ate the sacrifices offered to the gods, weren&amp;quot;t they becoming communal participants in what was sacrificed?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Now, am I saying that idols and the sacrifices offered to them have any value?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Absolutely not! However, I am implying that when an unbeliever offers a sacrifice to an idol, it is not offered to the true God but to a demon. I don&amp;quot;t want you to be participants with demons!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">You can&amp;quot;t drink from the cup of the Lord and the cup of demons. You can&amp;quot;t feast at the table of the Lord and feast at the table of demons.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Who would ever want to arouse the Lord&amp;quot;s jealousy? Is that something you think you&amp;quot;re strong enough to endure?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">You say , &amp;apos; Under grace there are no rules and we&amp;quot;re free to do anything we please.&amp;apos; Not exactly. Because not everything promotes growth in others. Your slogan, &amp;apos;We&amp;quot;re allowed to do anything we choose,&amp;apos; may be true&amp;ndash;but not everything causes the spiritual advancement of others.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">So don&amp;quot;t always seek what is best for you at the expense of another.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">Yes, you are free to eat anything without worrying about your conscience,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">for the earth and all its abundance belongs to the Lord.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">So if an unbeliever invites you to dinner, go ahead and eat whatever is served, without asking questions concerning where it came from.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">But if he goes out of his way to inform you that the meat was actually an offering sacrificed to idols, then you should pass, not only for his sake but because of his conscience.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">I&amp;quot;m talking about someone else&amp;quot;s conscience, not yours. What good is there in doing what you please if it&amp;quot;s condemned by someone else?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">So if I voluntarily participate, why should I be judged for celebrating my freedom?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">Whether you eat or drink, live your life in a way that glorifies and honors God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">And make sure you&amp;quot;re not offending Jews or Greeks or any part of God&amp;quot;s assembly over your personal preferences .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">Follow my example , for I try to please everyone in all things, rather than putting my liberty first. I sincerely attempt to do anything I can so that others may be saved.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="11">
			<VERS vnumber="1">I want you to pattern your lives after me, just as I pattern mine after Christ.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">And I give you full credit for always keeping me in mind as you follow carefully the substance of my instructions that I&amp;quot;ve taught you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">But I want you to understand that Christ is the head of every person, and Adam was the head of Eve, and God is the head of the Messiah.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Any man who leads public worship , and prays or prophesies with a shawl hanging down over his head, shows disrespect to his head, which is Christ .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">And if any woman in a place of leadership within the church prays or prophesies in public with her long hair disheveled, she shows disrespect to her head, which is her husband , for this would be the same as having her head shaved.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">If a woman who wants to be in leadership will not conform to the customs of what is proper for women, she might as well cut off her hair. But if it&amp;quot;s disgraceful for her to have her hair cut off or her head shaved, let her cover her head.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">A man in leadership is under no obligation to have his head covered in the public gatherings , because he is the portrait of God and reflects his glory. The woman, on the other hand, reflects the glory of her husband,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">for man was not created from woman but woman from man.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">By the same token, the man was not created because the woman needed him; the woman was created because the man needed her.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">For this reason she should have authority over the head because of the angels.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">So then, I have to insist that in the Lord, neither is woman inferior to man nor is man inferior to woman.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">For just as woman was taken from the side of man, in the same way man is taken from the womb of woman. God, as the source of all things, designed it this way .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">So then you can decide for yourselves&amp;ndash;is it proper for a woman to pray to God with her hair unbound?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Doesn&amp;quot;t our long-established cultural tradition teach us that if a man has long hair that is ornamentally arranged it invites disgrace, but if a woman has long hair that is ornamentally arranged it is her glory?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">This is because long hair is the endowment that God has given her as a head covering.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">If someone wants to quarrel about this, I want you to know that we have no intention to start an argument, neither I nor the congregations of God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Now, on this next matter, I wish I could commend you, but I cannot, because when you meet together as a church family it is doing more harm than good!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">I&amp;quot;ve been told many times that when you meet as a congregation, divisions and cliques emerge&amp;ndash;and to some extent, this doesn&amp;quot;t surprise me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Differences of opinion are unavoidable, yet they will reveal which ones among you truly have God&amp;quot;s approval.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">When all of your house churches gather as one church family, you are not really properly celebrating the Lord&amp;quot;s Supper.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">For when it comes time to eat, some gobble down their food before anything is given to others&amp;ndash;one is left hungry while others become drunk!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Don&amp;quot;t you all have homes where you can eat and drink? Don&amp;quot;t you realize that you&amp;quot;re showing a superior attitude by humiliating those who have nothing? Are you trying to show contempt for God&amp;quot;s beloved church? How should I address this appropriately? If you&amp;quot;re looking for my approval, you won&amp;quot;t find it!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">I have handed down to you what came to me by direct revelation from the Lord himself. The same night in which he was handed over, he took bread</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">and gave thanks. Then he distributed it to the disciples and said, &amp;apos;Take it and eat your fill. It is my body, which is given for you. Do this to remember me.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">He did the same with the cup of wine after supper and said, &amp;apos;This cup seals the new covenant with my blood. Drink it&amp;ndash;and whenever you drink this, do it to remember me.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">Whenever you eat this bread and drink this cup, you are retelling the story, proclaiming our Lord&amp;quot;s death until he comes.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">For this reason, whoever eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in the wrong spirit will be guilty of dishonoring the body and blood of the Lord.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">So let each individual first evaluate his own attitude and only then eat the bread and drink the cup.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">For continually eating and drinking with a wrong spirit will bring judgment upon yourself by not recognizing the body.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">This insensitivity is why many of you are weak, chronically ill, and some even dying.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">If we have examined ourselves, we should not be judged.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">But when we are judged, it is the Lord&amp;quot;s training so that we will not be condemned along with the world.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">So then, my fellow believers, when you assemble as one to share a meal, show respect for one another and wait for all to be served.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">If you are that hungry, eat at home first, so that when you gather together you will not bring judgment upon yourself. When I come to you, I will answer the other questions you asked me in your letter .</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="12">
			<VERS vnumber="1">My fellow believers, I don&amp;quot;t want you to be confused about spiritual realities.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">For you know full well that when you were unbelievers you were often led astray in one way or another by your worship of idols, which are incapable of talking with you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Therefore, I want to impart to you an understanding of the following: No one speaking by the Spirit of God would ever say, &amp;apos;Jesus is the accursed one.&amp;apos; No one can say, &amp;apos;Jesus is the Lord Yahweh ,&amp;apos; unless the Holy Spirit is speaking through him. The Spirit gives to one the gift of the word of wisdom. To another, the same Spirit gives the gift of the word of revelation knowledge. And to another, the same Spirit gives gifts of healing. And to another the gift of prophecy. And to another the gift to discern what the Spirit is speaking. gifts of revelation knowledge, gifts of leadership, And now I will show you a superior way to live that is beyond comparison!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">It is the same Holy Spirit who continues to distribute many different varieties of gifts.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">The Lord Yahweh is one, and he is the one who apportions to believers different varieties of ministries.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">The same God distributes different kinds of miracles that accomplish different results through each believer&amp;quot;s gift and ministry as he energizes and activates them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Each believer is given continuous revelation by the Holy Spirit to benefit not just himself but all.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">For example:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">And to another, the same Spirit gives the gift of faith.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">And to another the power to work miracles. And to another the gift of speaking different kinds of tongues. And to another the gift of interpretation of tongues. First apostles, second prophets, third teachers, then those with gifts of miracles, gifts of divine healing, and gifts of different kinds of tongues.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Remember, it is the same Holy Spirit who distributes, activates, and operates these different gifts as he chooses for each believer.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Just as the human body is one, though it has many parts that together form one body, so too is Christ.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">For by one Spirit we all were immersed and mingled into one single body. And no matter our status&amp;ndash;whether we are Jews or non-Jews, oppressed or free&amp;ndash;we are all privileged to drink deeply of the same Holy Spirit.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">In fact, the human body is not one single part but rather many parts mingled into one .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">So if the foot were to say, &amp;apos;Since I&amp;quot;m not a hand, I&amp;quot;m not a part of the body,&amp;apos; it&amp;quot;s forgetting that it is still a vital part of the body.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">And if the ear were to say, &amp;apos;Since I&amp;quot;m not an eye, I&amp;quot;m not really a part of the body,&amp;apos; it&amp;quot;s forgetting that it is still an important part of the body.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Think of it this way . If the whole body were just an eyeball, how could it hear sounds? And if the whole body were just an ear, how could it smell different fragrances?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">But God has carefully designed each member and placed it in the body to function as he desires.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">A diversity is required , for if the body consisted of one single part, there wouldn&amp;quot;t be a body at all!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">So now we see that there are many differing parts and functions, but one body.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">It would be wrong for the eye to say to the hand, &amp;apos;I don&amp;quot;t need you,&amp;apos; and equally wrong if the head said to the foot, &amp;apos;I don&amp;quot;t need you.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">In fact, the weaker our parts, the more vital and essential they are.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">The body parts we think are less honorable we treat with greater respect. And the body parts that need to be covered in public we treat with propriety and clothe them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">But some of our body parts don&amp;quot;t require as much attention. Instead, God has mingled the body parts together, giving greater honor to the &amp;apos;lesser&amp;apos; members who lacked it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">He has done this intentionally so that every member would look after the others with mutual concern, and so that there will be no division in the body.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">In that way, whatever happens to one member happens to all. If one suffers, everyone suffers. If one is honored, everyone rejoices.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">You are the body of the Anointed One, and each of you is a unique and vital part of it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">God has placed in the church the following:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">Not everyone is an apostle or a prophet or a teacher. Not everyone performs miracles</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="2">And if I were to have the gift of prophecy with a profound understanding of God&amp;quot;s hidden secrets, and if I possessed unending supernatural knowledge, and if I had the greatest gift of faith that could move mountains, but have never learned to love, then I am nothing.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">And if I were to be so generous as to give away everything I owned to feed the poor, and to offer my body to be burned as a martyr , without the pure motive of love, I would gain nothing of value.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Love is large and incredibly patient. Love is gentle and consistently kind to all. It refuses to be jealous when blessing comes to someone else . Love does not brag about one&amp;quot;s achievements nor inflate its own importance.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Love does not traffic in shame and disrespect, nor selfishly seek its own honor. Love is not easily irritated or quick to take offense.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Love joyfully celebrates honesty and finds no delight in what is wrong.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Love is a safe place of shelter, for it never stops believing the best for others. Love never takes failure as defeat, for it never gives up.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Love never stops loving. It extends beyond the gift of prophecy, which eventually fades away. It is more enduring than tongues, which will one day fall silent. Love remains long after words of knowledge are forgotten.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="9">So it is with you. Unless you speak in a language that&amp;quot;s easily understood, how will anyone know what you&amp;quot;re talking about? You might as well save your breath!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">I suppose that the world has all sorts of languages, and each conveys meaning to the ones who speak it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">But I am like a foreigner if I don&amp;quot;t understand the language, and the speaker will be like a foreigner to me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">And that&amp;quot;s what&amp;quot;s happening among you. You are so passionate about embracing the manifestations of the Holy Spirit! Now become even more passionate about the things that strengthen the entire church.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">So then, if you speak in a tongue, pray for the interpretation to be able to unfold the meaning of what you are saying.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">For if I am praying in a tongue, my spirit is engaged in prayer but I have no clear understanding of what is being said.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">So here&amp;quot;s what I&amp;quot;ve concluded. I will pray in the Spirit, but I will also pray with my mind engaged. I will sing rapturous praises in the Spirit, but I will also sing with my mind engaged.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Otherwise, if you are praising God in your spirit, how could someone without the gift participate by adding his &amp;apos;amen&amp;apos; to your giving of thanks, since he doesn&amp;quot;t have a clue of what you&amp;quot;re saying?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Your praise to God is admirable, but it does nothing to strengthen and build up others.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">I give thanks to God that I speak in tongues more than all of you,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">but in the church setting I would rather speak five words that can be understood than ten thousand exotic words in a tongue. That way I could have a role in teaching others.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Beloved ones, don&amp;quot;t remain as immature children in your reasoning. As it relates to evil, be like newborns, but in your thinking be mature adults.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">For it stands written in the law: I will bring my message to this people with strange tongues and foreign lips, yet even then they still will not listen to me, says the Lord.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">So then, tongues are not a sign for believers, but a miracle for unbelievers. Prophecy, on the other hand, is not for unbelievers, but a miracle sign for believers.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">If the entire church comes together and everyone is speaking in tongues, won&amp;quot;t the visitors say that you have lost your minds?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">But if everyone is prophesying, and an unbeliever or one without the gift enters your meeting, he will be convicted by all that he hears and will be called to account,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">for the intimate secrets of his heart will be brought to light. He will be mystified and fall facedown in worship and say, &amp;apos;God is truly among you!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">Beloved friends, what does all this imply? When you conduct your meetings, you should always let everything be done to build up the church family. Whether you share a song of praise, a teaching, a divine revelation, or a tongue and interpretation, let each one contribute what strengthens others.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">If someone speaks in a tongue, it should be two or three, one after another, with someone interpreting.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">If there&amp;quot;s no one with the interpretation, then he should remain silent in the meeting, content to speak to himself and to God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">And the same with prophecy . Let two or three prophets prophesy and let the other prophets carefully evaluate and discern what is being said.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">But if someone receives a revelation while someone else is still speaking, the one speaking should conclude and allow the one with fresh revelation the opportunity to share it .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">For you can all prophesy in turn and in an environment where all present can be instructed, encouraged, and strengthened.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">The spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">For God is the God of harmony, not confusion, as is the pattern in all the churches of God&amp;quot;s holy believers.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">The women should be respectfully silent during the evaluation of prophecy in the meetings . They are not allowed to interrupt, but are to be in a support role, as in fact the law teaches.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">If they want to inquire about something, let them ask their husbands when they get home, for a woman embarrasses herself when she constantly interrupts the church meeting.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">Do you actually think that you were the starting point for the Word of God going forth? Were you the only ones it was sent to? I don&amp;quot;t think so!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">If anyone considers himself to be a prophet or a spiritual person, let him discern that what I&amp;quot;m writing to you carries the Lord&amp;quot;s authority.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">And if anyone continues not to recognize this, he should not be recognized!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">So, beloved friends, with all this in mind, be passionate to prophesy and don&amp;quot;t forbid anyone from speaking in tongues,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">doing all things in a beautiful and orderly way.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="15">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Dear friends, let me give you clearly the heart of the gospel that I&amp;quot;ve preached to you&amp;ndash;the good news that you have heartily received and on which you stand.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">For it is through the revelation of the gospel that you are being saved, if you fasten your life firmly to the message I&amp;quot;ve taught you, unless you have believed in vain.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">For I have shared with you what I have received and what is of utmost importance: The Messiah died for our sins, fulfilling the prophecies of the Scriptures. and was raised from the dead after three days,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">He was buried in a tomb as foretold in the Scriptures. and to the twelve apostles. Let&amp;quot;s party all night, for tomorrow we die! The first man, Adam, became a living soul. The last Adam became the life-giving Spirit. Death is swallowed up by a triumphant victory! Tell me death, where is your sting?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Then he appeared to Peter the Rock</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">He also appeared to more than five hundred of his followers at the same time, most of whom are still alive as I write this, though a few have passed away.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Then he appeared to Jacob and to all the apostles.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Last of all he appeared in front of me, like one born prematurely, ripped from the womb.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Yes, I am the most insignificant of all the apostles, unworthy even to be called an apostle, because I hunted down believers and persecuted God&amp;quot;s church.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">But God&amp;quot;s amazing grace has made me who I am! And his grace to me was not fruitless. In fact, I worked harder than all the rest, yet not in my own strength but God&amp;quot;s, for his empowering grace is poured out upon me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">So this is what we all have taught you, and whether it was through me or someone else, you have now believed the gospel.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">The message we preach is Christ, who has been raised from the dead. So how could any of you possibly say there is no resurrection of the dead?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">For if there is no such thing as a resurrection from the dead, then not even Christ has been raised.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">And if Christ has not been raised, all of our preaching has been for nothing and your faith is useless.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Moreover, if the dead are not raised, that would mean that we are false witnesses who are misrepresenting God. And that would mean that we have preached a lie, stating that God raised him from the dead, if in reality he didn&amp;quot;t.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">If the dead aren&amp;quot;t raised up, that would mean that Christ has not been raised up either.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">And if Christ is not alive, you are still lost in your sins and your faith is a fantasy.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">It would also mean that those believers in Christ who have passed away have simply perished.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">If the only benefit of our hope in Christ is limited to this life on earth, we deserve to be pitied more than all others!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">But the truth is, Christ is risen from the dead, as the firstfruit of a great resurrection harvest of those who have died.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">For since death came through a man, Adam , it is fitting that the resurrection of the dead has also come through a man, Christ .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Even as all who are in Adam die, so also all who are in Christ will be made alive.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">But each one in his proper order: Christ, the firstfruits, then those who belong to Christ in his presence.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">Then the final stage of completion comes, when he will bring to an end every other rulership, authority, and power, and he will hand over his kingdom to Father God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">Until then he is destined to reign as King until all hostility has been subdued and placed under his feet.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">And the last enemy to be subdued and eliminated is death itself.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">The Father has placed all things in subjection under the feet of Christ. Yet when it says, &amp;apos;all things,&amp;apos; it is understood that the Father does not include himself, for he is the one who placed all things in subjection to Christ.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">However, when everything is subdued and in submission to him, then the Son himself will be subject to the Father, who put all things under his feet. This is so that Father God will be everything in everyone!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">If there is no resurrection, what do these people think they&amp;quot;re doing when they are baptized for the dead? If the dead aren&amp;quot;t raised, why be baptized for them?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">And why would we be risking our lives every day?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">My brothers and sisters, I continually face death. This is as sure as my boasting of you and our co-union together in the life of our Lord Jesus Christ, who gives me confidence to share my experiences with you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">Tell me, why did I fight &amp;apos;wild beasts&amp;apos; in Ephesus if my hope is in this life only? What was the point of that? If the dead do not rise, then</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">So stop fooling yourselves! Evil companions will corrupt good morals and character.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">Come back to your right senses and awaken to what is right. Repent from your sinful ways. For some have no knowledge of God&amp;quot;s wonderful love. You should be ashamed that you make me write this way to you!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">I can almost hear someone saying, &amp;apos;How can the dead come back to life? And what kind of body will they have when they are resurrected?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">Foolish man! Don&amp;quot;t you know that what you sow in the ground doesn&amp;quot;t germinate unless it dies?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">And what you sow is not the body that will come into being, but the bare seed. And it&amp;quot;s hard to tell whether it&amp;quot;s wheat or some other seed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">But when it dies, God gives it a new form, a body to fulfill his purpose, and he sees to it that each seed gets a new body of its own and becomes the plant he designed it to be .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">All flesh is not identical. Animals have one flesh and human beings another. Birds have their distinct flesh and fish another.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">In the same way there are earthly bodies and heavenly bodies. There is a splendor of the celestial body and a different one for the earthly.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">There is the radiance of the sun and differing radiance for the moon and for the stars. Even the stars differ in their shining.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">And that&amp;quot;s how it will be with the resurrection of the dead.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43">The body is &amp;apos;sown&amp;apos; in decay, but will be raised in immortality. It is &amp;apos;sown&amp;apos; in humiliation, but will be raised in glorification.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44">It is &amp;apos;sown&amp;apos; in weakness but will be raised in power. If there is a physical body, there is also a spiritual body.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45">For it is written:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46">However, the spiritual didn&amp;quot;t come first. The natural precedes the spiritual.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="47">The first man was from the dust of the earth; the second Man is Yahweh , from the realm of heaven.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="48">The first one, made from dust, has a race of people just like him, who are also made from dust. The One sent from heaven has a race of heavenly people who are just like him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="49">Once we carried the likeness of the man of dust, but now let us carry the likeness of the man of heaven.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="50">Now, I tell you this, my brothers and sisters, flesh and blood are not able to inherit God&amp;quot;s kingdom realm, and neither will that which is decaying be able to inherit what is incorruptible.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="51">Listen, and I will tell you a divine mystery: not all of us will die, but we will all be transformed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="52">It will happen in an instant &amp;ndash;in the twinkling of his eye. For when the last trumpet is sounded, the dead will come back to life. We will be indestructible and we will be transformed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="53">For we will discard our mortal &amp;apos;clothes&amp;apos; and slip into a body that is imperishable. What is mortal now will be exchanged for immortality.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="54">And when that which is mortal puts on immortality, and what now decays is exchanged for what will never decay, then the Scripture will be fulfilled that says:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="55">So death, tell me, where is your victory?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="56">It is sin that gives death its sting and the law that gives sin its power.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="57">But we thank God for giving us the victory as conquerors through our Lord Jesus, the Anointed One.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="58">So now, beloved ones, stand firm, stable, and enduring. Live your lives with an unshakable confidence. We know that we prosper and excel in every season by serving the Lord, because we are assured that our union with the Lord makes our labor productive with fruit that endures.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1">Now, concerning the collection I want you to take for God&amp;quot;s holy believers in Jerusalem who are in need , I want you to follow the same instructions I gave the churches of Galatia.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Every Sunday, each of you make a generous offering by taking a portion of whatever God has blessed you with and place it in safekeeping. Then I won&amp;quot;t have to make a special appeal when I come.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">When I arrive, I will send your gift to the poor in Jerusalem along with a letter of explanation, carried by those whom you approve.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">If it seems advisable for me to accompany them, I&amp;quot;ll be glad to have them travel with me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">I plan to be traveling through Macedonia, and afterward I will visit you</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">and perhaps stay there for a while, or even spend the winter with you. Afterward you can send me on my journey, wherever I go next, with your financial support.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">For it&amp;quot;s not my desire to just see you in passing, but I would like to spend some time with you if the Lord permits.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Regardless, I will remain in Ephesus until the feast of Pentecost.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">There&amp;quot;s an amazing door of opportunity standing wide open for me to minister here, even though there are many who oppose and stand against me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">When Timothy arrives, make sure that he feels at home while he&amp;quot;s with you, for he&amp;quot;s advancing the Lord&amp;quot;s work just as I am.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Don&amp;quot;t let anyone disparage or look down on him, but kindly help him on his way with financial support so that he may come back to me, for I am waiting for him and the brothers to return.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Now, about our brother Apollos. I&amp;quot;ve tried hard to convince him to come visit you with the other brothers, but it&amp;quot;s simply not the right time for him now. But don&amp;quot;t worry , he&amp;quot;ll come when he has the opportunity.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Remember to stay alert and hold firmly to all that you believe. Be mighty and full of courage.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="15">Dear brothers and sisters, I have a request to make of you. Give special recognition to Stephanas and his family, for they were the first converts in Achaia, and they have fully devoted themselves to serve God&amp;quot;s holy people.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">I urge you to honor and support them, and all those like them who work so diligently for the Lord.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">I was delighted when Stephanas, Fortunatus, and Achaicus arrived, for they&amp;quot;ve made up for your absence.</VERS>

	<BIBLEBOOK bnumber="47" bname="2  Corinthians">
		<CHAPTER cnumber="1">
			<VERS vnumber="1">From Paul to God&amp;quot;s called ones, his church in Corinth. I have been chosen by Jesus Christ to be his apostle according to God&amp;quot;s perfect plan. Our brother Timothy joins me in writing to you and all the holy believers throughout the Roman province of Achaia.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">May undeserved favor and endless peace be yours continually from our Father God and from our Lord Jesus, the Anointed One!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">All praises belong to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. For he is the Father of tender mercy and the God of endless comfort.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">He always comes alongside us to comfort us in every suffering so that we can come alongside those who are in any painful trial. We can bring them this same comfort that God has poured out upon us.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">And just as we experience the abundance of Christ&amp;quot;s own sufferings, even more of God&amp;quot;s comfort will cascade upon us through our union with Christ.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">If troubles weigh us down, that just means that we will receive even more comfort to pass on to you for your deliverance! For the comfort pouring into us empowers us to bring comfort to you. And with this comfort upholding you, you can endure victoriously the same suffering that we experience.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Now our hope for you is unshakable, because we know that just as you share in our sufferings you will also share in God&amp;quot;s comforting strength.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Brothers and sisters, you need to know about the severe trials we experienced while we were in western Turkey. All of the hardships we passed through crushed us beyond our ability to endure, and we were so completely overwhelmed that we were about to give up entirely.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">It felt like we had a death sentence written upon our hearts, and we still feel it to this day . It has taught us to lose all faith in ourselves and to place all of our trust in the God who raises the dead.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">He has rescued us from terrifying encounters with death. And now we fasten our hopes on him to continue to deliver us from death yet again,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">as you labor together with us through prayer. Because there are so many interceding for us , our deliverance will cause even more people to give thanks to God. What a gracious gift of mercy surrounds us because of your prayers!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">We rejoice in saying with complete honesty and a clear conscience that God has empowered us to conduct ourselves in a holy manner and with no hidden agenda. God&amp;quot;s marvelous grace enables us to minister to everyone with pure motives, not in the clever wisdom of the world. This is especially true in all of our dealings with you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">We write to you with words that are clearly understood, and there is no need for you to try to read between the lines of what we write in hopes that you can completely and accurately understand our hearts .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">We know you have already understood us in a measure and that you will eventually come to understand us fully. Then you&amp;quot;ll be able to boast of us even as we will boast of you in the day of our Lord Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">When I revised my itinerary, was I vacillating? Or do I make my plans with unprincipled motives, ready to flip-flop with a &amp;apos;yes&amp;apos; and a &amp;apos;no&amp;apos; in the same breath? Of course not!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">For as God is true to his word, my promise to you was not a fickle &amp;apos;yes&amp;apos; when I meant &amp;apos;no.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Jesus Christ is the Son of God, and he is the one whom Timothy, Silas, and I have preached to you&amp;ndash;and he has never been both a &amp;apos;yes&amp;apos; and a &amp;apos;no.&amp;apos; He has always been and always will be for us a resounding &amp;apos;YES!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">For all of God&amp;quot;s promises find their &amp;apos;yes&amp;apos; of fulfillment in him. And as his &amp;apos;yes&amp;apos; and our &amp;apos;amen&amp;apos; ascend to God, we bring him glory!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Now, it is God himself who has anointed us. And he is constantly strengthening both you and us in union with Christ.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">He knows we are his since he has also stamped his seal of love over our hearts and has given us the Holy Spirit like an engagement ring is given to a bride&amp;ndash;a down payment of the blessings to come!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">Now, I call upon this faithful God as a witness against me if I&amp;quot;m not telling you the absolute truth . It was because I hold you in my heart that I decided not to return to Corinth, in order to spare you the humiliation of my rebuke .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">But I don&amp;quot;t want to imply that as leaders we coerce you or somehow want to rule over your faith. Instead, we are your partners who are called to increase your joy. And we know that you already stand firm because of your strong faith.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="2">
			<VERS vnumber="1">So until these issues were settled , I decided against paying you another painful visit.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">For if I brought you pain, you would be unable to bring me joy.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">And this was the very point I made in my letter, for I didn&amp;quot;t want to come and find sadness filling the very ones who should give me cheer. But I&amp;quot;m confident that you will do what&amp;quot;s right so that my joyous delight will be yours.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">I wrote you previously sobbing and with a broken heart. I was filled with anguish and deep distress. I had no intention of causing you pain but to convey the overwhelming measure of my love for you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">For the one who has caused me grief has not only grieved me but, to some extent, has caused you all grief as well.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">I believe that your united rebuke has been punishment enough for him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Instead of more punishment, what he needs most is your encouragement through your gracious display of forgiveness.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">I beg you to reaffirm your deep love for him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">You see, I wrote previously in order to see if your hearts would pass the test and if you were willing to follow my counsel in everything.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">If you freely forgive anyone for anything, then I also forgive him. And if I have forgiven anything, I did so for you before the face of Christ,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">so that we would not be exploited by the adversary, Satan, for we know his clever schemes.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">When I arrived at Troas, bringing the wonderful news of Christ, the Lord opened a great door of opportunity to minister there.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Still, I had no peace of mind, because I couldn&amp;quot;t find my dear brother Titus anywhere. So after saying goodbye to the believers, I set out for Macedonia to look for him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">God always makes his grace visible in Christ, who includes us as partners of his endless triumph. Through our yielded lives he spreads the fragrance of the knowledge of God everywhere we go.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">We have become the unmistakable aroma of the victory of the Anointed One to God &amp;ndash;a perfume of life to those being saved and the odor of death to those who are perishing.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">The unbelievers smell a deadly stench that leads to death, but believers smell the life-giving aroma that leads to abundant life. And who of us can rise to this challenge?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">For unlike so many, we are not peddlers of God&amp;quot;s Word who water down the message. We are those sent from God with pure motives, who speak in the sight of God from our union with Christ.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="3">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Are we beginning to sound like those who speak highly of themselves? Do you really need letters of recommendation to validate our ministry , like others do? Do we really need your letter of endorsement? Of course not!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">For your very lives are our &amp;apos;letters of recommendation,&amp;apos; permanently engraved on our hearts, recognized and read by everybody.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">As a result of our ministry, you are living letters written by Christ, not with ink but by the Spirit of the living God&amp;ndash;not carved onto stone tablets but on the tablets of tender hearts.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">We carry this confidence in our hearts because of our union with Christ before God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Yet we don&amp;quot;t see ourselves as capable enough to do anything in our own strength, for our true competence flows from God&amp;quot;s empowering presence .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">He alone makes us adequate ministers who are focused on an entirely new covenant. Our ministry is not based on the letter of the law but through the power of the Spirit. The letter of the law kills, but the Spirit pours out life.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Even the ministry that was characterized by chiseled letters on stone tablets came with a dazzling measure of glory, though it produced death. The Israelites couldn&amp;quot;t bear to gaze on the glowing face of Moses because of the radiant splendor shining from his countenance&amp;ndash;a glory destined to fade away.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Yet how much more radiant is this new and glorious ministry of the Spirit that shines from us !</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">For if the former ministry of condemnation was ushered in with a measure of glory, how much more does the ministry that imparts righteousness far excel in glory.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">What once was glorious no longer holds any glory because of the increasingly greater glory that has replaced it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">The fading ministry came with a portion of glory, but now we embrace the unfading ministry of a permanent impartation of glory.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">So then, with this amazing hope living in us, we step out in freedom and boldness to speak the truth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">We are not like Moses, who used a veil to hide the glory to keep the Israelites from staring at him as it faded away.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Their minds were closed and hardened, for even to this day that same veil comes over their minds when they hear the words of the former covenant. The veil has not yet been lifted from them, for it is only eliminated when one is joined to the Messiah.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">So until now, whenever the Old Testament is being read, the same blinding comes over their hearts.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">But the moment one turns to the Lord with an open heart, the veil is lifted and they see .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Now, the &amp;apos;Lord&amp;apos; I&amp;quot;m referring to is the Holy Spirit, and wherever he is Lord, there is freedom.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">We can all draw close to him with the veil removed from our faces. And with no veil we all become like mirrors who brightly reflect the glory of the Lord Jesus . We are being transfigured into his very image as we move from one brighter level of glory to another. And this glorious transfiguration comes from the Lord, who is the Spirit.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="4">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Now, it&amp;quot;s because of God&amp;quot;s mercy that we have been entrusted with the privilege of this new covenant ministry. And we will not quit or faint with weariness.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">We reject every shameful cover-up and refuse to resort to cunning trickery or distorting the Word of God. Instead, we open up our souls to you by presenting the truth to everyone&amp;quot;s conscience in the sight and presence of God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Even if our gospel message is veiled, it is only veiled to those who are perishing,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">for their minds have been blinded by the god of this age, leaving them in unbelief. Their blindness keeps them from seeing the dayspring light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the divine image of God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">We don&amp;quot;t preach ourselves, but rather the lordship of Jesus Christ, for we are your servants for Jesus&amp;quot; sake.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">For God, who said, &amp;apos;Let brilliant light shine out of darkness,&amp;apos; is the one who has cascaded his light into us&amp;ndash;the brilliant dawning light of the glorious knowledge of God as we gaze into the face of Jesus Christ. &amp;apos;First I believed, then I spoke in faith.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">We are like common clay jars that carry this glorious treasure within, so that this immeasurable power will be seen as God&amp;quot;s, not ours.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Though we experience every kind of pressure, we&amp;quot;re not crushed. At times we don&amp;quot;t know what to do, but quitting is not an option.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">We are persecuted by others, but God has not forsaken us. We may be knocked down, but not out.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">We continually share in the death of Jesus in our own bodies so that the resurrection life of Jesus will be revealed through our humanity.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">We consider living to mean that we are constantly being handed over to death for Jesus&amp;quot; sake so that the life of Jesus will be revealed through our humanity.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">So, then, death is at work in us but it releases life in you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">We have the same Spirit of faith that is described in the Scriptures when it says, So we also first believe then speak in faith.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">We do this because we are convinced that he who raised Jesus will raise us up with him, and together we will all be brought into his presence.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Yes, all things work for your enrichment so that more of God&amp;quot;s marvelous grace will spread to more and more people, resulting in an even greater increase of praise to God, bringing him even more glory!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">So no wonder we don&amp;quot;t give up. For even though our outer person gradually wears out, our inner being is renewed every single day.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">We view our slight, short-lived troubles in the light of eternity. We see our difficulties as the substance that produces for us an eternal, weighty glory far beyond all comparison,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">because we don&amp;quot;t focus our attention on what is seen but on what is unseen. For what is seen is temporary, but the unseen realm is eternal.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="5">
			<VERS vnumber="1">We are convinced that even if these bodies we live in are folded up at death like tents, we will still have a God-built home that no human hands have built, which will last forever in the heavenly realm.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">We inwardly sigh as we live in these physical &amp;apos; tents ,&amp;apos; longing to put on a new body for our life in heaven,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">in the belief that once we put on our new &amp;apos;clothing&amp;apos; we won&amp;quot;t find ourselves &amp;apos;naked.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">So, while living in this &amp;apos;tent,&amp;apos; we groan under its burden, not because we want to die but because we want these new bodies. We crave for all that is mortal to be swallowed up by eternal life.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">And this is no empty hope , for God himself is the one who has prepared us for this wonderful destiny. And to confirm this promise, he has given us the Holy Spirit, like an engagement ring, as a guarantee.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">That&amp;quot;s why we&amp;quot;re always full of courage. Even while we&amp;quot;re at home in the body, we&amp;quot;re homesick to be with the Master&amp;ndash;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">for we live by faith, not by what we see with our eyes.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">We live with a joyful confidence, yet at the same time we take delight in the thought of leaving our bodies behind to be at home with the Lord.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">So whether we live or die we make it our life&amp;quot;s passion to live our lives pleasing to him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">For one day we will all be openly revealed before Christ on his throne so that each of us will be duly recompensed for our actions done in life, whether good or worthless.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Since we are those who stand in holy awe of the Lord, we make it our passion to persuade others to turn to him . We know that our lives are transparent before the God who knows us fully, and I hope that we are also well known to your consciences.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Again, we are not taking an opportunity to brag, but giving you information that will enable you to be proud of us, and to answer those who esteem outward appearances while overlooking what is in the heart.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">If we are out of our minds in a blissful, divine ecstasy, it is for God, but if we are in our right minds, it is for your benefit.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">For it is Christ&amp;quot;s love that fuels our passion and holds us tightly, because we are convinced that he has given his life for all of us. This means all died with him,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">so that those who live should no longer live self-absorbed lives but lives that are poured out for him&amp;ndash;the one who died for us and now lives again.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">So, from now on, we refuse to evaluate people merely by their outward appearances. For that&amp;quot;s how we once viewed the Anointed One, but no longer do we see him with limited human insight.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Now, if anyone is enfolded into Christ, he has become an entirely new person. All that is related to the old order has vanished. Behold, everything is fresh and new.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">And God has made all things new, and reconciled us to himself, and given us the ministry of reconciling others to God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">In other words, it was through the Anointed One that God was shepherding the world, not even keeping records of their transgressions, and he has entrusted to us the ministry of opening the door of reconciliation to God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">We are ambassadors of the Anointed One who carry the message of Christ to the world, as though God were tenderly pleading with them directly through our lips. So we tenderly plead with you on Christ&amp;quot;s behalf, &amp;apos;Turn back to God and be reconciled to him.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">For God made the only one who did not know sin to become sin for us, so that we might become the righteousness of God through our union with him.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="6">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Now, since we are God&amp;quot;s coworkers, we beg you not to take God&amp;quot;s marvelous grace for granted, allowing it to have no effect on your lives .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">For he says, I listened to you at the time of my favor. And the day when you needed salvation, So can&amp;quot;t you see? Now is the time to respond to his favor! Now is the day of salvation! I will make my home in them and walk among them. &amp;apos;Come out from among them and be separate,&amp;apos; says the Lord. and you will be my beloved sons and daughters,&amp;apos; I came to your aid. We have great endurance in hardships and in persecutions. We don&amp;quot;t lose courage in a time of stress and calamity. I will be their God, and they will be my people. &amp;apos;Touch nothing that is unclean, and I will embrace you. says the Lord Yahweh Almighty.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">We will not place obstacles in anyone&amp;quot;s way that hinder them from coming to salvation so that our ministry will not be discredited.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Yet, as God&amp;quot;s servants, we prove ourselves authentic in every way. For example :</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">We&amp;quot;ve been beaten many times, imprisoned, and found ourselves in the midst of riots. We&amp;quot;ve endured many troubles, had sleepless nights, and gone hungry.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">We have proved ourselves by our lifestyles of purity, by our spiritual insights, by our patience, and by showing kindness, by the Spirit of holiness and by our uncritical love for you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">We commend ourselves to you by our truthful teachings, by the power of God working through us , and with the mighty weapons of righteousness&amp;ndash; a sword in one hand and a shield in the other.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Amid honor or dishonor, slander or praise&amp;ndash; even when we are treated as deceivers and imposters&amp;ndash; we remain steadfast and true .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">We are unknown nobodies whom everyone knows. We are frequently at death&amp;quot;s door, yet here we are, still alive! We have been severely punished yet not executed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">We may suffer, yet in every season we are always found rejoicing. We may be poor, yet we bestow great riches on many. We seem to have nothing, yet in reality we possess all things.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">My friends at Corinth, our hearts are wide open to you and we speak freely, holding nothing back from you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">If there is a block in our relationship, it is not with us, for we carry you in our hearts with great love, yet you still withhold your affections from us.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">So I speak to you as our children. Make room in your hearts for us as we have done for you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Don&amp;quot;t continue to team up with unbelievers in mismatched alliances, for what partnership is there between righteousness and rebellion? Who could mingle light with darkness?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">What harmony can there be between Christ and Satan? Or what does a believer have in common with an unbeliever?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">What friendship does God&amp;quot;s temple have with demons? For indeed, we are the temple of the living God, just as God has said:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">For this reason,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">I will be a true Father to you,</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="7">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Beloved ones, with promises like these, and because of our deepest respect and worship of God, we must remove everything from our lives that contaminates body and spirit, and continue to complete the development of holiness within us.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Again, I urge you, make room for us in your hearts, for we have wronged no one, corrupted no one, and taken advantage of no one.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">I&amp;quot;m not saying this to condemn you, for I already told you that we carry you permanently in our hearts&amp;ndash;and you&amp;quot;ll stay there throughout our lives, for we will live together and die together.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">With an open heart let me freely say how very proud I am of you and how often I boast about you. In fact, when I think of you my heart is greatly encouraged and overwhelmed with joy, despite our many troubles.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Even after we came into the province of Macedonia, we found no relief. We were restless and exhausted; troubles met us at every turn. Outwardly I faced conflicts and inwardly emotional turmoil.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">But God, who always knows how to encourage the depressed, encouraged us greatly by the arrival of Titus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">We were relieved not only to see him but because of the report he brought us of how you refreshed his heart. He told us of your affection toward me, your deep remorse, and how concerned you were for me. This truly made my heart leap for joy!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Even if my letter made you sorrowful, I don&amp;quot;t regret sending it (even though I felt awful for a moment when I heard how it grieved you).</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Now I&amp;quot;m overjoyed&amp;ndash;not because I made you sad, but because your grief led you to a deep repentance. You experienced godly sorrow, and as God intended, it brought about gain for you, not loss, so that no harm has been done by us.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">God designed us to feel remorse over sin in order to produce repentance that leads to victory. This leaves us with no regrets. But the sorrow of the world works death.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Can&amp;quot;t you see the good fruit that has come, as God intended, because of your remorse over sin? Now you are eager to do what is right! Look at the indignation you experienced over what happened and how alarmed you became. What holy longing it awakened, what passion for God , and how ready you were to bring justice to the offender. Your response has proved that you are free of blame in this matter.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">So I wrote you not simply to correct the one who did the wrong or on the behalf of the one who was wronged, but to help you realize in God&amp;quot;s sight how loyal you are to us.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Your response leaves us so encouraged! You&amp;quot;ve made us even more joyful upon hearing of how you refreshed Titus, for his mind was set at ease by all of you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">I have not been embarrassed by you, for the things I bragged about you to Titus were not proven false. Just as everything we said to you was true, so our boasting to Titus about you has proven to be true as well.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">His affection toward you has grown as he remembers your obedience and how warmly you welcomed him with fear and trembling.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">I&amp;quot;m beside myself with joy! I am so confident in you!</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="8">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Beloved ones, we must tell you about the grace God poured out upon the churches of Macedonia.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">For even during a season of severe difficulty, tremendous suffering, and extreme poverty, their super-abundant joy overflowed into an act of extravagant generosity.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">For I can verify that they spontaneously gave, not only according to their means but far beyond what they could afford.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">They actually begged us for the privilege of sharing in this ministry of giving to God&amp;quot;s holy people who are living in poverty .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">They exceeded our expectations by first dedicating themselves fully to the Lord and then to us, according to God&amp;quot;s pleasure.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">That is why we appealed to Titus, since he was the one who got you started and encouraged you to give, so he could help you complete this generous undertaking on your behalf.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">You do well and excel in every respect&amp;ndash;in unstoppable faith, in powerful preaching, in revelation knowledge, in your passionate devotion, and in sharing the love we have shown to you. So make sure that you also excel in grace-filled generosity.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">I&amp;quot;m not saying this as though I were issuing an order but to stir you to greater love by mentioning the enthusiasm of the Macedonians as a challenge to you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">For you have experienced the extravagant grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that although he was infinitely rich, he impoverished himself for our sake, so that by his poverty, we become rich beyond measure .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">So here are my thoughts concerning this matter, and it&amp;quot;s in your best interests. Since you made such a good start last year, both in the grace of giving and in your longing to give,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">you should finish what you started. You were so eager in your intentions to give, so go do it. Finish this act of worship according to your ability to give.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">For if the intention and desire are there, the size of the gift doesn&amp;quot;t matter . Your gift is fully acceptable to God according to what you have, not what you don&amp;quot;t have.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">I&amp;quot;m not saying this in order to ease someone else&amp;quot;s load by overloading you, but as a matter of fair balance.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Your surplus could meet their need, and their abundance may one day meet your need. This equal sharing of abundance will mean a fair balance.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">As it is written: The one who gathered much didn&amp;quot;t have too much, and the one who gathered little didn&amp;quot;t have too little.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">We give thanks to God for putting the same devotion I have for you into the heart of Titus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Of course, he enthusiastically accepted our request to go to Corinth, but because he carries you in his heart, he&amp;quot;d already planned on coming.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">So we&amp;quot;re sending with him the brother who is greatly honored and respected in all the churches for his work of evangelism.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Not only that, he has been appointed by the churches to be our traveling companion as we carry and dispense this generous gift that glorifies the Lord and shows how eager we are to help.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">We are sending a team in order to avoid any criticism over how we handle this wonderfully generous gift,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">for we intend to do what is right and we are totally open both to the Lord&amp;quot;s inspection and to man&amp;quot;s.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">So we&amp;quot;re sending with them another brother who is faithful and proven to be a man of integrity. He is passionate to help you now more than ever, for he believes in you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">Concerning the credentials of Titus, he&amp;quot;s my partner and coworker in ministry for you. As for the brothers coming with him, they are apostles of the churches, which are the glory of the Anointed One.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">So demonstrate to them how much you love, and prove that our boasting of you is justified.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="9">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Actually, there&amp;quot;s no need to write to you about this contribution for the holy believers in Jerusalem ,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">for I already know that you are on board and eager to help. I keep boasting to the churches of Macedonia about your passion to give, telling them that the believers of Corinth have been preparing to give for a year. Your enthusiasm is contagious&amp;ndash;it has stirred many of them to do likewise.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Still, I thought it would be best to send these brothers to receive the offering that you&amp;quot;ve prepared, so that our boasting about how you were ready to give would not be found hollow.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">For if, after boasting of our confidence in you, some of the Macedonians were to come with me and find that you were not prepared, we would be embarrassed&amp;ndash;to say nothing of you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">That&amp;quot;s why I&amp;quot;ve requested that the brothers come before I do and make arrangements in advance for the substantial offering you pledged. Then it will be seen as a matter of generosity and not under pressure, as something you felt forced to do.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Here&amp;quot;s my point. A stingy sower will reap a meager harvest, but the one who sows from a generous spirit will reap an abundant harvest.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Let giving flow from your heart, not from a sense of religious duty. Let it spring up freely from the joy of giving&amp;ndash;all because God loves hilarious generosity!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Yes, God is more than ready to overwhelm you with every form of grace, so that you will have more than enough of everything &amp;ndash;every moment and in every way. He will make you overflow with abundance in every good thing you do.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Just as the Scriptures say about the one who trusts in him : Because he has sown extravagantly and given to the poor, his kindness and generous deeds will never be forgotten.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">This generous God who supplies abundant seed for the farmer, which becomes bread for our meals, is even more extravagant toward you. First he supplies every need, plus more. Then he multiplies the seed as you sow it , so that the harvest of your generosity will grow.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">You will be abundantly enriched in every way as you give generously on every occasion, for when we take your gifts to those in need, it causes many to give thanks to God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">The priestly ministry you are providing through your offering not only supplies what is lacking for God&amp;quot;s people, it inspires an outpouring of praises and thanksgiving to God himself.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">For as your extremely generous offering meets the approval of those in Jerusalem , it will cause them to give glory to God&amp;ndash;all because of your loyal support and allegiance to the gospel of Christ, as well as your generous-hearted partnership with them toward those in need.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Because of this extraordinary grace, which God has lavished on you, they will affectionately remember you in their prayers.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Praise God for his astonishing gift, which is far too great for words!</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="10">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Now, please listen, for I need to address an issue. I&amp;quot;m making this personal appeal to you by the gentleness and self-forgetfulness of Christ. I am the one who is &amp;apos;humble and timid&amp;apos; when face-to-face with you but &amp;apos;bold and outspoken&amp;apos; when a safe distance away.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Now I plead with you that when I come, don&amp;quot;t force me to take a hard line with you (which I&amp;quot;m willing to do) by daring to confront those who mistakenly believe that we are living by the standards of the world, not by the Spirit&amp;quot;s wisdom and power .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">We can demolish every deceptive fantasy that opposes God and break through every arrogant attitude that is raised up in defiance of the true knowledge of God. We capture, like prisoners of war, every thought and insist that it bow in obedience to the Anointed One.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Since we are armed with such dynamic weaponry , we stand ready to punish any trace of rebellion, as soon as you choose complete obedience.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">You seem to always be looking at people by their outward appearances. If someone is confident that he belongs to Christ, he should remind himself of this: we belong to Christ no less than he does.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">I am not ashamed, even if I&amp;quot;ve come across as one who has overstated the authority given to us by the Lord. For it is the authority to help build you up, not tear you down.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">I don&amp;quot;t want to seem as though I&amp;quot;m trying to bully you with my letters.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">For I can imagine some of you saying, &amp;apos;His letters are authoritative and stern, but when he&amp;quot;s with us he&amp;quot;s not that impressive and he&amp;quot;s a poor speaker.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Such a person should realize that when we arrive, there will be no difference in the actions we take and the words we write.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Of course, we wouldn&amp;quot;t dare to put ourselves in the same class or compare ourselves with those who rate themselves so highly. They compare themselves to one another and make up their own standards to measure themselves by, and then they judge themselves by their own standards. What self-delusion!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">But we are those who choose to limit our boasting to only the measure of the work to which God has appointed us&amp;ndash;a measure that, by the way, has reached as far as you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">And since you are within our assigned limits, we didn&amp;quot;t overstep our boundaries of authority by being the first to announce to you the wonderful news of the Anointed One.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">We&amp;quot;re not trying to take credit for the ministry done by others, going beyond the limits God set for us . Instead, our hope soars as your faith continues to grow, causing a great expansion of our ministry among you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Then we can go and preach the good news in the regions beyond you without trespassing on the ministry sphere of other laborers and what they have already done.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">For: The one who boasts must boast in the Lord.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">So let&amp;quot;s be clear . To have the Lord&amp;quot;s approval and commendation is of greater value than bragging about oneself.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="11">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Now, please bear with some of my &amp;apos;craziness&amp;apos; for a moment. Yes, please be patient with me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">You need to know that God&amp;quot;s passion is burning inside me for you, because, like a loving father, I have pledged your hand in marriage to Christ, your true bridegroom. I&amp;quot;ve also promised that I would present his fiancÃ©e to him as a pure virgin bride.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">But now I&amp;quot;m afraid that just as Eve was deceived by the serpent&amp;quot;s clever lies, your thoughts may be corrupted and you may lose your single-hearted devotion and pure love for Christ.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">For you seem to gladly tolerate anyone who comes to you preaching a pseudo-Jesus, not the Jesus we have preached. You have accepted a spirit and gospel that is false, rather than the Spirit and gospel you once embraced. How tolerant you have become of these imposters!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Now, I believe that I am not inferior in any way to these special &amp;apos;super-apostles&amp;apos; you are attracted to.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">For although I may not be a polished or eloquent speaker, I&amp;quot;m certainly not an amateur in revelation knowledge. Indeed, we have demonstrated this to you time and again.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Have I committed a sin by degrading myself to dignify you? Was I wrong to preach the gospel of God to you free of charge?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">I received ample financial support from other churches just so that I could freely serve you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Remember, when I was with you I didn&amp;quot;t bother anyone when I needed money, for my needs were always supplied by my Macedonian friends. So I was careful, and will continue to be careful, that I never become a burden to you in any way.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">As the reality of Christ lives within me, my glad boast of offering the gospel free of charge will not be silenced throughout the region of Achaia.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Why? Is it because I have no love for you? God knows how much I love you!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">But in order to eliminate the opportunity for those &amp;apos;super-apostles&amp;apos; to boast that their ministry is on the same level as ours I will continue this practice.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">For they are not true apostles but deceitful ministers who masquerade as &amp;apos;special apostles&amp;apos; of the Anointed One.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">That doesn&amp;quot;t surprise us, for even Satan transforms himself to appear as an angel of light!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">So it&amp;quot;s no wonder his servants also go about pretending to be ministers of righteousness. But in the end they will be exposed and get exactly what they deserve.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">So I repeat. Let no one think that I&amp;quot;m a fool. But if you do, at least show me the patience you would show a fool, so that I too may boast a little.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Of course, what I&amp;quot;m about to tell you is not with the Lord&amp;quot;s authority, but as a &amp;apos;fool.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">For since many love to boast about their worldly achievements, allow me the opportunity to join them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">And since you are so smart and so wise to gladly put up with the foolishness of others, now put up with mine .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">You actually allow these imposters to put you into bondage, take complete advantage of you, and rob you blind! How easily you endure those who, in their arrogance, destroy your dignity or even slap you in the face.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">I must admit, to our shame that we were too &amp;apos;weak&amp;apos; to relate to you the way they do. But now let me dare to boast like a &amp;apos;fool.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Are these &amp;apos;super-apostles&amp;apos; of yours Hebrews? I am too. Are they Israelites? So am I. Are they descendants of Abraham? Me too!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">Are they servants of the Anointed One? I&amp;quot;m beside myself when I speak this way, but I am much more of a servant than they. I have worked much harder for God, taken more beatings, and been dragged to more prisons than they. I&amp;quot;ve been flogged excessively, multiple times, even to the point of death.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">Five times I&amp;quot;ve received thirty-nine lashes from the Jewish leaders.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">Three times I experienced being beaten with rods. Once they stoned me. Three times I&amp;quot;ve been shipwrecked; for an entire night and a day I was adrift in the open sea.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">In my difficult travels I&amp;quot;ve faced many dangerous situations: perilous rivers, robbers, foreigners, and even my own people. I&amp;quot;ve survived deadly peril in the city, in the wilderness, with storms at sea, and with spies posing as believers.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">I&amp;quot;ve toiled to the point of exhaustion and gone through many sleepless nights. I&amp;quot;ve frequently been deprived of food and water, left hungry and shivering out in the cold, lacking proper clothing.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">And besides these painful circumstances, I have the daily pressure of my responsibility for all the churches, with a deep concern weighing heavily on my heart for their welfare.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">I am not aloof , for who is desperate and weak and I do not feel their weakness? Who is led astray into sin and I do not burn with zeal to restore him ?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">If boasting is necessary, I will boast about examples of my weakness.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">The God and Father of the Lord Jesus, who is eternally praised, knows that I am speaking the truth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">Once, when I was in Damascus, the governor under King Aretas had his troops searching for me to have me arrested,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">but I was stuffed in a basket and lowered down through a window and managed to escape.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="12">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Although it may not accomplish a thing, I need to move on and boast about supernatural visions and revelations of the Lord.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Someone I&amp;quot;m acquainted with, who is in union with Christ, was swept away fourteen years ago in an ecstatic experience. He was taken into the third heaven, but I&amp;quot;m not sure if he was in his body or out of his body&amp;ndash;only God knows.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">And I know that this man (again, I&amp;quot;m not sure if he was still in his body or taken out of his body&amp;ndash;God knows)</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">was caught up in an ecstatic experience and brought into paradise, where he overheard many wondrous and inexpressible secrets that were so sacred that no mortal is permitted to repeat them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">I&amp;quot;m ready to boast of such an experience, but for my own good I refuse to boast unless it concerns my weaknesses.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">However, if I were to boast, it wouldn&amp;quot;t be ridiculous at all, for I would be speaking the truth. Yet I will refrain, lest others think higher of me than what I demonstrate with my life and teaching.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">The extraordinary level of the revelations I&amp;quot;ve received is no reason for anyone to exalt me. For this is why a thorn in my flesh was given to me, the Adversary&amp;quot;s messenger sent to harass me, keeping me from becoming arrogant.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Three times I pleaded with the Lord to relieve me of this.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">But he answered me, &amp;apos;My grace is always more than enough for you, and my power finds its full expression through your weakness.&amp;apos; So I will celebrate my weaknesses, for when I&amp;quot;m weak I sense more deeply the mighty power of Christ living in me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">So I&amp;quot;m not defeated by my weakness, but delighted! For when I feel my weakness and endure mistreatment&amp;ndash;when I&amp;quot;m surrounded with troubles on every side and face persecution because of my love for Christ&amp;ndash;I am made yet stronger. For my weakness becomes a portal to God&amp;quot;s power.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">I have become foolish to boast like this , but you have forced me to do it, when you should have boasted in me instead. For there is nothing I lack compared to these &amp;apos;super-apostles&amp;apos; of yours, even though I am nothing.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">The things that distinguish a true apostle were performed among you with great perseverance&amp;ndash;supernatural signs, startling wonders, and awesome miracles.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Furthermore, how were you treated worse than the other churches, except that I didn&amp;quot;t burden you financially&amp;ndash;forgive me for depriving you!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">And now here I am, ready to come to you for the third time, and I still refuse to be a burden to you. For what I really want is your hearts, not your money. After all, children should not have to accumulate resources for their parents, but parents do this for their children.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">And as a spiritual father to you , I will gladly spend all that I have and all that I am for you! If I love you more, will you respond by loving me less?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Be that as it may, I haven&amp;quot;t been a burden to you at all, yet you say of me, &amp;apos;He&amp;quot;s a scoundrel and a trickster!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">But let me ask you this . Did I somehow cheat or trick you through any of the men I sent your way?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">I was the one who insisted that Titus and our brother come and help you . Did Titus take advantage of you? Didn&amp;quot;t we all come to you in the same spirit, following in the ways of integrity ?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">I hope that you don&amp;quot;t assume that all this time we have simply been justifying ourselves in your eyes? Beloved ones, we have been speaking to you in the sight of God as those joined to Christ, and everything we do is meant to build you up and make you stronger in your faith.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Now I&amp;quot;m afraid that when I come to you I may find you different than I desire you to be, and you may find me different than you would like me to be. I don&amp;quot;t want to find you in disunity, with jealousy and angry outbursts, with selfish ambition, slander, gossip, arrogance, and turmoil.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">I&amp;quot;m actually afraid that on my next visit my God will humble me in front of you as I shed tears over those who keep sinning without repenting of their impurity, sexual immorality, and perversion.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="13">
			<VERS vnumber="1">This will be my third trip to you. And I will make sure that by the testimony of two or three witnesses every matter will be confirmed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">For although he was crucified as a &amp;apos;weakling,&amp;apos; now he lives robed with God&amp;quot;s power. And we also are &amp;apos;weak ones&amp;apos; in our co-crucifixion with him, but now we live in God&amp;quot;s triumphant power together with him, which is demonstrated on your behalf.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Now your souls will be strengthened and healed if you hold steadfast to your faith. Haven&amp;quot;t you already experienced Jesus Christ himself living in you? If not, you are deficient.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">I hope you understand that we cannot be devalued.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">But we pray to God that you will be flawless, not to validate our ministry among you but so that you may continue on the path of righteousness even if we are denigrated.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">For in reality, the power we have is used in support of the truth, not against it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">And we claim before God that you will be fully equipped and mature, for it brings us great joy when you are strong, even if we seem weak and denigrated.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">I&amp;quot;m writing my honest feelings to you from afar so that when I arrive I won&amp;quot;t have to correct you by using the authority the Lord has given me, for I want to build you up and not tear you down.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Finally, beloved friends, be cheerful! Repair whatever is broken among you, as your hearts are being knit together in perfect unity. Live continually in peace, and God, the source of love and peace, will mingle with you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Greet and embrace one another with the sacred kiss.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">All of God&amp;quot;s holy people send their greetings.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Now, may the grace and joyous favor of the Lord Jesus Christ, the unambiguous love of God, and the precious communion that we share in the Holy Spirit be yours continually. Amen!</VERS>

	<BIBLEBOOK bnumber="48" bname="Galatians">
		<CHAPTER cnumber="1">
			<VERS vnumber="1">From Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ. My apostleship was not granted to me by men, for I was appointed by Jesus Christ, and God the Father, who raised him from the dead.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">All the brothers and sisters join with me as I write this letter to the churches throughout the region of central Turkey.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">May God&amp;quot;s undeserved kindness and total well-being that flow from our Father God and from the Lord Jesus be yours.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">He&amp;quot;s the Anointed One who offered himself as the sacrifice for our sins! He has rescued us from this evil world system and set us free, just as our Father God desired.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">May all the glory be to God alone, throughout time and eternity. Amen!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">I am shocked over how quickly you have strayed away from the One who called you in the grace of Christ. I&amp;quot;m astounded that you now embrace a distorted gospel!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">That is a fake &amp;apos;gospel&amp;apos; that is simply not true. There is only one gospel&amp;ndash;the good news of Christ! Yet you have allowed those who mingle law with grace to confuse you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">But even if we or an angel from heaven should preach a gospel different than the one we preached to you, let them be under God&amp;quot;s curse!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Let me make it clear: Anyone, no matter who they are, that brings you a different gospel than the gospel that you have received, let them be condemned and cursed!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">I&amp;quot;m obviously not trying to flatter you or water down my message to be popular with men, but my supreme passion is to please God. For if all I attempt to do is please people, I would fail to be a true servant of Christ.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Beloved ones, let me repeat emphatically that the gospel entrusted to me was not given to me by any man.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">No one taught me this revelation, for it was given to me directly by the unveiling of Jesus Christ.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">By now you have heard stories of how severely I harassed and persecuted Christians and how systematically I endeavored to destroy God&amp;quot;s church, all because of my radical devotion to the Jewish religion.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">My zeal and passion for the doctrines of Judaism distinguished me among my people, for I was far more advanced in my religious instruction than others my age.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">But then God called me by his grace, and chose me from my birth to be his.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">He was pleased to unveil his Son in me so that I would proclaim him to the peoples of the world. After I had this encounter, I kept it a secret for some time, sharing it with no one.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">And I had no desire to run to Jerusalem and try to impress those who had become apostles before me. Instead, I withdrew into the Arabian Desert. Then I returned to Damascus, where I had first encountered Jesus .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">I remained there for three years until I eventually went up to Jerusalem, met the apostle Peter, and stayed with him for a couple of weeks.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">The only other apostle I met during that time was Jacob, the Lord&amp;quot;s brother.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Everything I&amp;quot;m describing to you I confess before God to be the absolute truth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">After my stay in Jerusalem, I went to Syria and southeast Turkey,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">but I remained unknown to the churches in Judea.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">The only thing they heard about me was this: &amp;apos;Our former enemy, who once brutally persecuted us, is now preaching the good news of the faith that he tried to destroy!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">Because of the transformation that took place in my life , they praised God even more!</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="2">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Fourteen years later, I returned to Jerusalem, this time with Barnabas and Titus, my coworkers .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">God gave me a clear revelation to go and confer with the other apostles concerning the message of grace I was preaching to the gentiles. I spoke privately with those who were viewed as senior leaders of the church, wanting to make certain that my labor and ministry for the Messiah had not been based on a false understanding of the gospel.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Even though Titus was a Syrian, they accepted him as a brother without demanding that he first be circumcised.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">I met with them privately because false &amp;apos;brothers&amp;apos; had been secretly smuggled into church meetings. They were sent to spy on the wonderful freedom that we have in Jesus Christ. Their agenda was to bring us back into the bondage of religion .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">But you must know that we did not submit to their religious shackles, not even for a moment, so that we might keep the truth of the gospel of grace unadulterated for you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Even those most influential among the brothers were not able to add anything to my message. Who they are before men makes no difference to me, for God is not impressed by their reputations.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">So they recognized that I was entrusted with taking the gospel to the gentiles just as Peter was entrusted with taking it to the Jews.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">For the same God who empowered Peter&amp;quot;s apostolic ministry to the Jews also flowed through me as an apostle to those who are gentiles.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">When they all recognized this grace operating in my ministry, those who were recognized as influential pillars in the church&amp;ndash;Jacob, Peter, and John&amp;ndash;extended to Barnabas and me the warmth of Christian fellowship and honored my calling to minister to the gentiles, even as they were to go to the Jews.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">They simply requested one thing of me: that I would remember the poor and needy, which was the burden I was already carrying in my heart.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">When Peter visited Antioch, he caused the believers to stumble over his behavior , so I confronted him to his face.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">He enjoyed eating with the gentile believers who didn&amp;quot;t keep the Jewish customs&amp;ndash;up until the time Jacob&amp;quot;s Jewish friends arrived from Jerusalem. When he saw them, he withdrew from his gentile friends&amp;ndash;fearing how it would look to them if he ate with gentile believers .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">And so, because of Peter&amp;quot;s hypocrisy, many other Jewish believers followed suit, refusing to eat with gentile believers. Even Barnabas was led astray by their hypocritical behavior!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">So when I realized they were acting inconsistently with the revelation of the gospel, I confronted Peter in front of everyone: &amp;apos;You were born a Jew, but you&amp;quot;ve chosen to disregard Jewish regulations and live like a gentile. Why then do you force gentiles to conform to these same rules?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Although we&amp;quot;re Jews by birth and not gentile &amp;apos;sinners,&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">we know that no one receives God&amp;quot;s perfect righteousness as a reward for keeping the law, but only by the faith of Jesus, the Messiah! His faithfulness has saved us, and we have received God&amp;quot;s perfect righteousness. Now we know that God accepts no one by the keeping of religious laws!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">If we are those who desire to be righteous through our union with the Anointed One, does that mean our Messiah condones sin even though we acknowledge that we are sinners? How absurd!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">For if I start over and reconstruct the old religious system that I had torn down with the message of grace , I would appear to be a lawbreaker.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">For through the law I died to the law, so that I might live to God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">My old identity has been co-crucified with Christ and no longer lives. And now the essence of this new life is no longer mine, for the Anointed One lives his life through me&amp;ndash; we live in union as one ! My new life is empowered by the faith of the Son of God who loves me so much that he gave himself for me, dispensing his life into mine !</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">So that is why I don&amp;quot;t view God&amp;quot;s grace as something peripheral. For if keeping the law could release God&amp;quot;s righteousness to us, then Christ would have died for nothing.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="3">
			<VERS vnumber="1">What has happened to you foolish Galatians? Who has put you under an evil spell? Did God not open your eyes to see the meaning of Jesus&amp;quot; crucifixion? Was he not revealed to you as the crucified one?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">So answer me this: Did the Holy Spirit come to you as a reward for keeping Jewish laws ? No, you received him as a gift because you believed in the Messiah.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Your new life began when the Holy Spirit gave you a new birth. Why then would you so foolishly turn from living in the Spirit by trying to finish by your own works?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Have you endured so many trials and persecutions for nothing?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Let me ask you again: What does the lavish supply of the Holy Spirit in your life and the miracles of God&amp;quot;s tremendous power have to do with you keeping religious laws? The Holy Spirit is poured out upon us through the revelation and power of faith!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Abraham, our father of faith , believed God, and the substance of his faith released God&amp;quot;s righteousness to him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">So the true children of Abraham have the same faith as their father!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">And the Scripture prophesied that on the basis of faith God would declare gentiles to be righteous. God announced the good news ahead of time to Abraham: &amp;apos;Through your example of faith, all the nations will be blessed!&amp;apos; &amp;apos;Utterly cursed is everyone who fails to practice every detail and requirement that is written in this law!&amp;apos; &amp;apos;The one who is in a right relationship with God will live by faith!&amp;apos; &amp;apos;If you practice the principles of law, you must follow all of them.&amp;apos; &amp;apos;Everyone who is hung upon a tree is cursed.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">And so the blessing of Abraham&amp;quot;s faith is now our blessing too!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">But if you rely on works of keeping the law for salvation , you live under the law&amp;quot;s curse. For it is clearly written:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">It is obvious that no one achieves the righteousness of God by attempting to keep the law, for it is written:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">But keeping the law does not require faith, but self-effort . For the law teaches,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Yet, Christ paid the full price to set us free from the curse of the law. He absorbed the curse completely as he became a curse in our place. For it is written:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Jesus Christ dissolved the curse from our lives, so that in him all the blessings of Abraham can be poured out upon gentiles. And now through faith we receive the promised Holy Spirit who lives in us .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Beloved friends, let me use an illustration that we can all understand. Technically, when a contract is signed, it can&amp;quot;t be changed after it has been put into effect; it&amp;quot;s too late to alter the agreement.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Remember the royal proclamation God spoke over Abraham and to Abraham&amp;quot;s child? God said that his promises were made to pass on to Abraham&amp;quot;s &amp;apos;Child,&amp;apos; not children. And who is this &amp;apos;Child?&amp;apos; It&amp;quot;s the Son of promise , Christ himself!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Why then was the law given at all? It was given alongside the promise to show people their sins. But the law was designed to last only until the coming of the &amp;apos;Seed,&amp;apos; the child who was promised. When God gave the law, he gave it first to angels; they gave it to Moses , his mediator, who then gave it to the people.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Now, a mediator does not represent just one party alone, but God fulfilled it all by himself!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Since that&amp;quot;s true, should we consider the written law to be contrary to the promise of new life? How absurd! Truly, if there was a law that we could keep which would give us new life, then our salvation would have come by law-keeping.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">But the Scriptures make it clear that the whole world is imprisoned by sin! This was so the promise would be given through faith to people who believe in Jesus Christ.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">So until the revelation of faith for salvation was released, the law was a jailer, holding us as prisoners under lock and key until the &amp;apos;faith,&amp;apos; which was destined to be revealed, would set us free .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">The law was our guardian until Christ came so that we would be saved by faith.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">But now that faith has come we are no longer under the guardian of the law .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">You have all become true children of God by faith in Jesus Christ!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">Faith immersed you into Christ, and now you are covered and clothed with his life.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">And we no longer see each other in our former state &amp;ndash;Jew or non-Jew, rich or poor, male or female&amp;ndash;because we&amp;quot;re all one through our union with Jesus Christ.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">And if you belong to Christ, then you are now Abraham&amp;quot;s &amp;apos;child&amp;apos; and a true heir of all his blessings because of the promise God made to Abraham !</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="4">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Let me illustrate: As long as an heir is a minor, he&amp;quot;s not really much different than a servant, although he&amp;quot;s the master over all of them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">For until the time appointed by the father, the child is under the domestic supervision of the guardians of the estate.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">So it is with us. When we were juveniles we were enslaved under the hostile spirits of the world.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">But when the time of fulfillment had come, God sent his Son, born of a woman, born under the law.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Yet all of this was so that he would redeem and set free those held hostage to the law so that we would receive our freedom and a full legal adoption as his children.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">And so that we would know that we are his true children, God released the Spirit of Sonship into our hearts&amp;ndash;moving us to cry out intimately, &amp;apos;My Father! My true Father!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Now we&amp;quot;re no longer living like slaves under the law , but we enjoy being God&amp;quot;s very own sons and daughters! And because we&amp;quot;re his, we can access everything our Father has &amp;ndash;for we are heirs because of what God has done!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Before we knew God as our Father , we were unwitting servants to the powers that be, which are nothing compared to God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">But now that we truly know him and are intimately known by him, why would we for a moment consider turning back to those weak and feeble principles of religion, as though we were still subject to them?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Why would we want to scrupulously observe rituals like special days, celebrations of the new moon, annual festivals, and sacred years?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">I&amp;quot;m so alarmed about you that I&amp;quot;m beginning to wonder if my labor in ministry among you was a waste of time!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Beloved ones, I plead with you, brothers and sisters, become like me, for I became like you. You did me no wrong.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">You are well aware that the reason I stayed among you to preach the good news was because of the poor state of my health.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">And yet you were so kind to me and did not despise me in my weakness, even though my physical condition put you through an ordeal while I was with you. Actually, you received me and cared for me as though I were an angel from God, as you would have cared for Jesus Christ himself! &amp;apos;Burst forth with gladness, rejoice, O barren woman with no children, break through with the shouts of joy and jubilee, for you are about to give birth! The one who was once considered desolate and barren The son of the slave woman will not be a true heir&amp;ndash;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Some of you were even willing, if it were possible, to pluck out your own eyes to replace mine! Where is that kindhearted and free spirit now?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Have I really become your enemy because I tell you the truth?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Can&amp;quot;t you see what these false teachers are doing? They want to win you over so you will side with them. They want you divided from me so you will follow only them. Would you call that integrity?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Isn&amp;quot;t it better to seek excellence and integrity always, and not just only when I&amp;quot;m with you?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">You are my dear children, but I agonize in spiritual &amp;apos;labor pains&amp;apos; once again, until the Anointed One will be fully formed in your hearts!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">How I wish I could be there in person and change my tone toward you, for I am truly dumbfounded over what you are doing!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">Ishmael , the son of the slave girl, was born of the natural realm. But Isaac , the son of the freewoman, was born supernaturally by the Spirit &amp;ndash;a child of the promise of God!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">These two women and their sons express an allegory and become symbols of two covenants. The first covenant was born on Mount Sinai, birthing children into slavery&amp;ndash;children born to Hagar.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">For &amp;apos;Hagar&amp;apos; represents the law given at Mount Sinai in Arabia. The &amp;apos;Hagar&amp;apos; metaphor corresponds to the earthly Jerusalem of today who are currently in bondage.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">In contrast, there is a heavenly Jerusalem above us, which is our true &amp;apos;mother.&amp;apos; She is the freewoman, birthing children into freedom!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">For it is written: now has more children than the one who has a husband!&amp;apos; &amp;apos;Expel the slave mother with her son! for the true heir of the promises is the son of the freewoman.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">Dear friends, just like Isaac, we&amp;quot;re now the true children who inherit the kingdom promises.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">And just as the son of the natural world at that time harassed the son born of the power of the Holy Spirit, so it is today.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">And what does the Scripture tell us to do?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">It&amp;quot;s now so obvious! We&amp;quot;re not the children of the slave woman; we&amp;quot;re the supernatural sons of the freewoman&amp;ndash; sons of grace !</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="5">
			<VERS vnumber="1">At last we have freedom, for Christ has set us free! We must always cherish this truth and firmly refuse to go back into the bondage of our past.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">I, Paul, tell you: If you think there is benefit in circumcision and Jewish regulations, then you&amp;quot;re acting as though Christ is not enough.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">I say it again emphatically: If you let yourselves be circumcised you are obliged to fulfill every single one of the commandments and regulations of the law!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">If you want to be made right with God by fulfilling the obligations of the law, you have cut off more than your flesh &amp;ndash;you have cut yourselves off from Christ and have fallen away from the revelation of grace!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">But we have the true hope that comes from being made right with God, and by the Spirit we wait eagerly for this hope.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">When you&amp;quot;re joined to the Anointed One, circumcision and religious obligations can benefit you nothing. All that matters now is living in the faith that works and expresses itself through love.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Before you were led astray, you were so faithful. Who has deceived you so that you have turned from what is right?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">The One who enfolded you into his grace is not behind this false teaching that you&amp;quot;ve embraced.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Don&amp;quot;t you know that when you allow even a little lie into your heart, it can permeate your entire belief system?</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="11">Dear friends, why do you think the religious system persecutes me? Is it because I preach the message of being circumcised and keeping all the laws of Judaism? Not at all! Is there no longer any offense over the cross?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">To tell you the truth, I am so disgusted with all your agitators. I wish they would go even further and cut off their legalistic influence from your lives!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Beloved ones, God has called us to live a life of freedom. But don&amp;quot;t view this wonderful freedom as an excuse to set up a base of operations in the natural realm. Constantly love each other and be committed to serve one another.</VERS>

Never set the law above these qualities, for they are meant to be limitless.</VERS>

And the Holy Spirit&amp;quot;s intense cravings hinder your self-life from dominating you! So then, the two incompatible and conflicting forces within you are your self-life of the flesh and the new creation life of the Spirit.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">But when you yield to the life of the Spirit, you will no longer be living under the law, but soaring above it !</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">The behavior of the self-life is obvious: Sexual immorality, lustful thoughts, pornography,</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1">Dear friends , My name is Paul, and I was chosen by God to be an apostle of Jesus, the Messiah.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">I&amp;quot;m writing this letter to all the devoted believers who have been made holy by being one with Jesus, the Anointed One. May God himself, the heavenly Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, release grace over you and impart total well-being into your lives.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Every spiritual blessing in the heavenly realm has already been lavished upon us as a love gift from our wonderful heavenly Father, the Father of our Lord Jesus&amp;ndash;all because he sees us wrapped into Christ. This is why we celebrate him with all our hearts!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">And in love he chose us before he laid the foundation of the universe! Because of his great love, he ordained us, so that we would be seen as holy in his eyes with an unstained innocence.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Since we are now joined to Christ, we have been given the treasures of redemption by his blood&amp;ndash;the total cancellation of our sins&amp;ndash;all because of the cascading riches of his grace.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">This superabundant grace is already powerfully working in us, releasing all forms of wisdom and practical understanding.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">And through the revelation of the Anointed One, he unveiled his secret desires to us&amp;ndash;the hidden mystery of his long-range plan, which he was delighted to implement from the very beginning of time.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">And because of God&amp;quot;s unfailing purpose, this detailed plan will reign supreme through every period of time until the fulfillment of all the ages finally reaches its climax&amp;ndash;when God makes all things new in all of heaven and earth through Jesus Christ.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Through our union with Christ we too have been claimed by God as his own inheritance. Before we were even born, he gave us our destiny; that we would fulfill the plan of God who always accomplishes every purpose and plan in his heart.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">God&amp;quot;s purpose was that we Jews , who were the first to long for the messianic hope, would be the first to believe in the Anointed One and bring great praise and glory to God!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">And because of him, when you who are not Jews heard the revelation of truth, you believed in the wonderful news of salvation. Now we have been stamped with the seal of the promised Holy Spirit.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">He is given to us like an engagement ring, as the first installment of what&amp;quot;s coming! He is our hope-promise of a future inheritance which seals us until we have all of redemption&amp;quot;s promises and experience complete freedom&amp;ndash;all for the supreme glory and honor of God!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Because of this, since I first heard about your strong faith in the Lord Jesus Christ and your tender love toward all his devoted ones,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">my heart is always full and overflowing with thanks to God for you as I constantly remember you in my prayers.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">I pray that the Father of glory, the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, would impart to you the riches of the Spirit of wisdom and the Spirit of revelation to know him through your deepening intimacy with him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">I pray that the light of God will illuminate the eyes of your imagination, flooding you with light, until you experience the full revelation of the hope of his calling &amp;ndash;that is, the wealth of God&amp;quot;s glorious inheritances that he finds in us, his holy ones!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">I pray that you will continually experience the immeasurable greatness of God&amp;quot;s power made available to you through faith. Then your lives will be an advertisement of this immense power as it works through you! This is the mighty power</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">that was released when God raised Christ from the dead and exalted him to the place of highest honor and supreme authority in the heavenly realm!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">And now he is exalted as first above every ruler, authority, government, and realm of power in existence! He is gloriously enthroned over every name that is ever praised, not only in this age, but in the age that is coming!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">And he alone is the leader and source of everything needed in the church. God has put everything beneath the authority of Jesus Christ and has given him the highest rank above all others .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">And now we, his church, are his body on the earth and that which fills him who is being filled by it!</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="2">
			<VERS vnumber="1">And his fullness fills you , even though you were once like corpses, dead in your sins and offenses.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">It wasn&amp;quot;t that long ago that you lived in the religion, customs, and values of this world, obeying the dark ruler of the earthly realm who fills the atmosphere with his authority, and works diligently in the hearts of those who are disobedient to the truth of God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">The corruption that was in us from birth was expressed through the deeds and desires of our self-life. We lived by whatever natural cravings and thoughts our minds dictated, living as rebellious children subject to God&amp;quot;s wrath like everyone else.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">But God still loved us with such great love. He is so rich in compassion and mercy.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Even when we were dead and doomed in our many sins, he united us into the very life of Christ and saved us by his wonderful grace!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">He raised us up with Christ the exalted One, and we ascended with him into the glorious perfection and authority of the heavenly realm, for we are now co-seated as one with Christ!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Throughout the coming ages we will be the visible display of the infinite riches of his grace and kindness, which was showered upon us in Jesus Christ.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">For by grace you have been saved by faith. Nothing you did could ever earn this salvation, for it was the love gift from God that brought us to Christ!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">So no one will ever be able to boast, for salvation is never a reward for good works or human striving.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">We have become his poetry, a re-created people that will fulfill the destiny he has given each of us, for we are joined to Jesus, the Anointed One. Even before we were born, God planned in advance our destiny and the good works we would do to fulfill it !</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Yet look at you now! Everything is new! Although you were once distant and far away from God, now you have been brought delightfully close to him through the sacred blood of Jesus&amp;ndash;you have actually been united to Christ!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Our reconciling &amp;apos;Peace&amp;apos; is Jesus! He has made Jew and non-Jew one in Christ . By dying as our sacrifice , he has broken down every wall of prejudice that separated us and has now made us equal through our union with Christ .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Ethnic hatred has been dissolved by the crucifixion of his precious body on the cross. The legal code that stood condemning every one of us has now been repealed by his command . His triune essence has made peace between us by starting over&amp;ndash;forming one new race of humanity, Jews and non-Jews fused together in himself!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Two have now become one, and we live restored to God and reconciled in the body of Christ. Through his crucifixion, hatred died.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">For the Messiah has come to preach this sweet message of peace to you, the ones who were distant, and to those who are near.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">And now, because we are united to Christ, we both have equal and direct access in the realm of the Holy Spirit to come before the Father!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">So, you are not foreigners or guests, but rather you are the children of the city of the holy ones, with all the rights as family members of the household of God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">You are rising like the perfectly fitted stones of the temple ; and your lives have been built up together upon the foundation laid by the apostles and prophets, and best of all, you are connected to the Head Cornerstone of the building, the Anointed One, Jesus Christ himself!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">This entire building is under construction and is continually growing under his supervision until it rises up completed as the holy temple of the Lord himself.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">This means that God is transforming each one of you into the Holy of Holies , his dwelling place, through the power of the Holy Spirit living in you!</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="2">so that you will hear the gospel that God has entrusted to me to share with you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">For this wonderful mystery, which I briefly described, was given to me by divine revelation,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">so that whenever you read it you will be able to understand my revelation and insight into the secret mystery of the Messiah.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">There has never been a generation that has been given the detailed understanding of this glorious and divine mystery until now. He kept it a secret until this generation. God is revealing it only now to his sacred apostles and prophets by the Holy Spirit.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Here&amp;quot;s the secret: The gospel of grace has made you, non-Jewish believers, into coheirs of his promise through your union with him. And you have now become members of his body&amp;ndash;one with the Anointed One!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">My passion is to enlighten every person to this divine mystery. It was hidden for ages past until now, and kept a secret in the heart of God, the Creator of all.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">The purpose of this was to unveil before every throne and rank of angelic orders in the heavenly realm God&amp;quot;s full and diverse wisdom revealed through the church.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">This perfectly wise plan was destined from eternal ages and fulfilled completely in our Lord Jesus Christ, so that now</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">we have boldness through him, and free access as kings before the Father because of our complete confidence in Christ&amp;quot;s faithfulness.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">My dear friends, I pray that you will remain strong and not be discouraged or ashamed by all that I suffer on your behalf, for it is for your glory.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">So I kneel humbly in awe before the Father of our Lord Jesus, the Messiah,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">the perfect Father of every father and child in heaven and on the earth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">And I pray that he would unveil within you the unlimited riches of his glory and favor until supernatural strength floods your innermost being with his divine might and explosive power.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Then, by constantly using your faith, the life of Christ will be released deep inside you, and the resting place of his love will become the very source and root of your life.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Never doubt God&amp;quot;s mighty power to work in you and accomplish all this. He will achieve infinitely more than your greatest request, your most unbelievable dream, and exceed your wildest imagination! He will outdo them all, for his miraculous power constantly energizes you.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1">As a prisoner of the Lord, I plead with you to walk holy, in a way that is suitable to your high rank, given to you in your divine calling.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="3">Be faithful to guard the sweet harmony of the Holy Spirit among you in the bonds of peace,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">being one body and one spirit, as you were all called into the same glorious hope of divine destiny .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">For the Lord God is one, and so are we , for we share in one faith, one baptism, and one Father.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">And he is the perfect Father who leads us all, works through us all, and lives in us all!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">And he has generously given each one of us supernatural grace, according to the size of the gift of Christ.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">This is why he says: &amp;apos;He ascends into the heavenly heights taking his many captured ones with him, and gifts were given to men.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">He &amp;apos;ascended&amp;apos; means that he returned to heaven, after he had first descended from the heights of heaven, even to the lower regions, namely, the earth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">The same one who descended is also the one who ascended above the heights of heaven, in order to begin the restoration and fulfillment of all things.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">And he has appointed some with grace to be apostles, and some with grace to be prophets, and some with grace to be evangelists, and some with grace to be pastors, and some with grace to be teachers.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">And their calling is to nurture and prepare all the holy believers to do their own works of ministry, and as they do this they will enlarge and build up the body of Christ.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">These grace ministries will function until we all attain oneness into the faith, until we all experience the fullness of what it means to know the Son of God, and finally we become one into a perfect man with the full dimensions of spiritual maturity and fully developed into the abundance of Christ.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">And then our immaturity will end! And we will not be easily shaken by trouble, nor led astray by novel teachings or by the false doctrines of deceivers who teach clever lies.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">But instead we will remain strong and always sincere in our love as we express the truth. All our direction and ministries will flow from Christ and lead us deeper into him, the anointed Head of his body, the church.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">For his &amp;apos;body&amp;apos; has been formed in his image and is closely joined together and constantly connected as one. And every member has been given divine gifts to contribute to the growth of all; and as these gifts operate effectively throughout the whole body, we are built up and made perfect in love.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">So with the wisdom given to me from the Lord I say: You should not live like the unbelievers around you who walk in their empty delusions.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Their corrupted logic has been clouded because their hearts are so far from God&amp;ndash;their blinded understanding and deep-seated moral darkness keeps them from the true knowledge of God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Because of spiritual apathy, they surrender their lives to lewdness, impurity, and sexual obsession.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">But this is not the way of life that Christ has unfolded within you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">If you have really experienced the Anointed One, and heard his truth, it will be seen in your life ; for we know that the ultimate reality is embodied in Jesus!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">And he has taught you to let go of the lifestyle of the ancient man, the old self-life, which was corrupted by sinful and deceitful desires that spring from delusions.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">Now it&amp;quot;s time to be made new by every revelation that&amp;quot;s been given to you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">And to be transformed as you embrace the glorious Christ-within as your new life and live in union with him! For God has re-created you all over again in his perfect righteousness, and you now belong to him in the realm of true holiness.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">So discard every form of dishonesty and lying so that you will be known as one who always speaks the truth, for we all belong to one another.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">But don&amp;quot;t let the passion of your emotions lead you to sin! Don&amp;quot;t let anger control you or be fuel for revenge , not for even a day.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">Don&amp;quot;t give the slanderous accuser, the Devil, an opportunity to manipulate you!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">If any one of you has stolen from someone else, never do it again. Instead, be industrious, earning an honest living, and then you&amp;quot;ll have enough to bless those in need.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">And never let ugly or hateful words come from your mouth, but instead let your words become beautiful gifts that encourage others; do this by speaking words of grace to help them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">The Holy Spirit of God has sealed you in Jesus Christ until you experience your full salvation. So never grieve the Spirit of God or take for granted his holy influence in your life.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">Lay aside bitter words, temper tantrums, revenge, profanity, and insults.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="4">Guard your speech. Forsake obscenities and worthless insults; these are nonsensical words that bring disgrace and are unnecessary. Instead, let worship fill your heart and spill out in your words.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">For it has been made clear to you already that the kingdom of God cannot be accessed by anyone who is guilty of sexual sin, or who is impure or greedy&amp;ndash;for greed is the essence of idolatry. How could they expect to have an inheritance in Christ&amp;quot;s kingdom while doing those things ?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Don&amp;quot;t be fooled by those who speak their empty words and deceptive teachings telling you otherwise. This is what brings God&amp;quot;s anger upon the rebellious!</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="13">Because of this, you must wear all the armor that God provides so you&amp;quot;re protected as you confront the slanderer, for you are destined for all things and will rise victorious.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Put on truth as a belt to strengthen you to stand in triumph. Put on holiness as the protective armor that covers your heart.</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="1">
			<VERS vnumber="1">From Paul and Timothy, both of us servants of Jesus, the Anointed One. To all his devoted followers in Philippi, including your pastors, and to all the servant-leaders of the church.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">May the blessings of divine grace and supernatural peace that flow from God our wonderful Father, and our Messiah, the Lord Jesus, be upon your lives.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">and our enduring partnership that began the first time I presented to you the gospel.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">I pray with great faith for you , because I&amp;quot;m fully convinced that the One who began this gracious work in you will faithfully continue the process of maturing you until the unveiling of our Lord Jesus Christ!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">It&amp;quot;s no wonder I pray with such confidence, since you have a permanent place in my heart! You have remained partners with me in the wonderful grace of God even though I&amp;quot;m here in chains for standing up for the truth of the gospel.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Only God knows how much I dearly love you with the tender affection of Jesus, the Anointed One.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">I continue to pray for your love to grow and increase beyond measure, bringing you into the rich revelation of spiritual insight in all things.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">This will enable you to choose the most excellent way of all &amp;ndash;becoming pure and without offense until the unveiling of Christ.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">And you will be filled completely with the fruits of righteousness that are found in Jesus, the Anointed One&amp;ndash;bringing great praise and glory to God!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">I want you to know, dear ones, what has happened to me has not hindered, but helped my ministry of preaching the gospel, causing it to expand and spread to many people.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">For now the elite Roman guards and government officials overseeing my imprisonment have plainly recognized that I am here because of my love for the Anointed One.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">And what I&amp;quot;m going through has actually caused many believers to become even more courageous in the Lord and to be bold and passionate to preach the Word of God, all because of my chains.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">It&amp;quot;s true that there are some who preach Christ out of competition and controversy, for they are jealous over the way God has used me . Many others have purer motives &amp;ndash;they preach with grace and love filling their hearts,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">because they know I&amp;quot;ve been destined for the purpose of defending the revelation of God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Those who preach Christ with ambition and competition are insincere&amp;ndash;they just want to add to the hardships of my imprisonment.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Yet in spite of all of this I am overjoyed! For what does it matter as long as Christ is being preached? If they preach him with mixed motives or with genuine love, the message of Christ is still being preached. And I will continue to rejoice</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">because I know that the lavish supply of the Spirit of Jesus, the Anointed One, and your intercession for me will bring about my deliverance.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">No matter what, I will continue to hope and passionately cling to Christ, so that he will be openly revealed through me before everyone&amp;quot;s eyes. So I will not be ashamed! In my life or in my death, Christ will be magnified in me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">My true life is the Anointed One, and dying means gaining more of him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">Yet deep in my heart I&amp;quot;m confident that I will be spared so I can add to your joy and further strengthen and mature your faith.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">When I am freed to come to you, my deliverance will give you a reason to boast even more in Jesus Christ.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">Whatever happens, keep living your lives based on the reality of the gospel of Christ. Then when I come to see you, or hear good reports of you, I&amp;quot;ll know that you stand united in one Spirit and one passion&amp;ndash;celebrating together as conquerors in the faith of the gospel.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">And then you will never be shaken or intimidated by the opposition that rises up against us. Your courage will prove to be a sure sign from God of their coming destruction.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">For God has graciously given you the privilege not only to believe in Christ, but also to suffer for him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">For you have been called by him to endure the conflict in the same way I have endured it&amp;ndash;for you know I&amp;quot;m not giving up.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="2">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Look at how much encouragement you&amp;quot;ve found in your relationship with the Anointed One! You are filled to overflowing with his comforting love. You have experienced a deepening friendship with the Holy Spirit and have felt his tender affection and mercy.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">So I&amp;quot;m asking you, my friends, that you be joined together in perfect unity&amp;ndash;with one heart, one passion, and united in one love. Walk together with one harmonious purpose and you will fill my heart with unbounded joy.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Be free from pride-filled opinions, for they will only harm your cherished unity . Don&amp;quot;t allow self-promotion to hide in your hearts, but in authentic humility put others first and view others as more important than yourselves.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Abandon every display of selfishness. Possess a greater concern for what matters to others instead of your own interests.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">And consider the example that Jesus, the Anointed One, has set before us. Let his mindset become your motivation.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">He existed in the form of God, yet he gave no thought to seizing equality with God as his supreme prize.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Instead he emptied himself of his outward glory by reducing himself to the form of a lowly servant. He became human!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">He humbled himself and became vulnerable, choosing to be revealed as a man and was obedient. He was a perfect example , even in his death&amp;ndash;a criminal&amp;quot;s death by crucifixion!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Because of that obedience, God exalted him and multiplied his greatness! He has now been given the greatest of all names!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">The authority of the name of Jesus causes every knee to bow in reverence! Everything and everyone will one day submit to this name&amp;ndash;in the heavenly realm, in the earthly realm, and in the demonic realm.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">And every tongue will proclaim in every language: &amp;apos;Jesus Christ is Lord Yahweh ,&amp;apos; bringing glory and honor to God, his Father!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">My beloved ones, just like you&amp;quot;ve always listened to everything I&amp;quot;ve taught you in the past, I&amp;quot;m asking you now to keep following my instructions as though I were right there with you. Now you must continue to make this new life fully manifested as you live in the holy awe of God&amp;ndash;which brings you trembling into his presence.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">God will continually revitalize you, implanting within you the passion to do what pleases him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Live a cheerful life, without complaining or division among yourselves.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">For then you will be seen as innocent, faultless, and pure children of God, even though you live in the midst of a brutal and perverse culture. For you will appear among them as shining lights in the universe,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">holding out the words of eternal life. I haven&amp;quot;t labored among you for nothing, for your lives are the fruit of my ministry and will be my glorious boast at the unveiling of Christ!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">But I will rejoice even if my life is poured out like a liquid offering to God over your sacrificial and surrendered lives of faith.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">And so no matter what happens to me, you should rejoice in ecstatic celebration with me!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Yet I&amp;quot;m trusting in our Lord Jesus that I may send Timothy to you soon, so I can be refreshed when I find out how you&amp;quot;re doing.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Timothy is like no other. He carries the same passion for your welfare that I carry in my heart.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">For it seems as though everyone else is busy seeking what is best for themselves instead of the things that are most important to our Lord Jesus Christ.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">You already know about his excellent reputation, since he has served alongside me as a loyal son in the work of ministry.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">After I see what transpires with me he&amp;quot;s the one I will send to you to bless you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">And I&amp;quot;m trusting in my Lord to return to you in due time.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">But for now, I feel a stirring in my heart to send Epaphroditus back to you immediately. He&amp;quot;s a friend to me and a wonderful brother and fellow soldier who has worked with me as we serve as ministers of the gospel . And you sent him as your apostle to minister to me in my need.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">But now he is grieved to know that you found out he had been sick, so he longs to return and comfort you in this.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">It&amp;quot;s true he almost died, but God showed him mercy and healed him. And I&amp;quot;m so thankful to God for his healing, as I was spared from having the sorrow of losing him on top of all my other troubles!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">So you can see why I&amp;quot;m delighted to send him to you now. I know that you&amp;quot;re anxious to see him and rejoice in his healing, and it encourages me to know how happy you&amp;quot;ll be to have him back.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">So warmly welcome him home in the Lord, with joyous love, and esteem him highly, for people like him deserve it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">Because of me, he put his life on the line, despising the danger, so that he could provide for me with what you couldn&amp;quot;t, since you were so far away. And he did it all because of his ministry for Christ.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1">My beloved ones, don&amp;quot;t ever limit your joy or fail to rejoice in the wonderful experience of knowing our Lord Jesus! I don&amp;quot;t mind repeating what I&amp;quot;ve already written you because it protects you&amp;ndash;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">beware of those religious hypocrites who teach that you should be circumcised to please God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">For we have already experienced &amp;apos;heart-circumcision,&amp;apos; and we worship God in the power and freedom of the Holy Spirit, not in laws and religious duties . We are those who boast in what Jesus Christ has done, and not in what we can accomplish in our own strength.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">It&amp;quot;s true that I once relied on all that I had become . I had a reason to boast and impress people with my accomplishments&amp;ndash;more than others&amp;ndash;for my pedigree was impeccable.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">I was born a true Hebrew of the heritage of Israel as the son of a Jewish man from the tribe of Benjamin. I was circumcised eight days after my birth and was raised in the strict tradition of Orthodox Judaism , living a separated and devout life as a Pharisee.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">And concerning the righteousness of the Torah, no one surpassed me; I was without a peer. Furthermore, as a fiery defender of the truth, I persecuted the messianic believers with religious zeal.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Yet all of the accomplishments that I once took credit for, I&amp;quot;ve now forsaken them and I regard it all as nothing compared to the delight of experiencing Jesus Christ as my Lord!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">To truly know him meant letting go of everything from my past and throwing all my boasting on the garbage heap. It&amp;quot;s all like a pile of manure to me now, so that I may be enriched in the reality of knowing Jesus Christ and embrace him as Lord in all of his greatness.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">My passion is to be consumed with him and not cling to my own &amp;apos;righteousness&amp;apos; based in keeping the written Law. My only &amp;apos;righteousness&amp;apos; will be his, based on the faithfulness of Jesus Christ&amp;ndash;the very righteousness that comes from God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">And I continually long to know the wonders of Jesus and to experience the overflowing power of his resurrection working in me. I will be one with him in his sufferings and become like him in his death.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Only then will I be able to experience complete oneness with him in his resurrection from the realm of death.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">I admit that I haven&amp;quot;t yet acquired the absolute fullness that I&amp;quot;m pursuing, but I run with passion into his abundance so that I may reach the purpose for which Christ Jesus laid hold of me to make me his own.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">I don&amp;quot;t depend on my own strength to accomplish this; however I do have one compelling focus: I forget all of the past as I fasten my heart to the future instead.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">I run straight for the divine invitation of reaching the heavenly goal and gaining the victory-prize through the anointing of Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">So let all who are fully mature have this same passion, and if anyone is not yet gripped by these desires, God will reveal it to them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">And let us all advance together to reach this victory-prize, following one path with one passion.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">My beloved friends, imitate my walk with God and follow all those who walk according to the way of life we modeled before you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">For there are many who live by different standards. As I&amp;quot;ve warned you many times (I weep as I write these words), they are enemies of the cross of the Anointed One and</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">doom awaits them. Their god has possessed them and made them mute. Their boast is in their shameful lifestyles and their minds are in the dirt.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">But we are a colony of heaven on earth as we cling tightly to our life-giver, the Lord Jesus Christ,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">who will transform our humble bodies and transfigure us into the identical likeness of his glorified body. And using his matchless power, he continually subdues everything to himself.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="3">I would like my dear friend and burden-bearer to help resolve this issue, for both women have diligently labored with me for the prize and helped in spreading the revelation of the gospel, along with Clement and the rest of my coworkers. All of their names are written in the Book of Life.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Be cheerful with joyous celebration in every season of life. Let your joy overflow!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">And let gentleness be seen in every relationship, for our Lord is ever near.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Don&amp;quot;t be pulled in different directions or worried about a thing. Be saturated in prayer throughout each day, offering your faith-filled requests before God with overflowing gratitude. Tell him every detail of your life,</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="10">My heart overflows with joy when I think of how you demonstrated love to me by your financial support of my ministry . For even though you have so little, you still continue to help me at every opportunity.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">I&amp;quot;m not telling you this because I&amp;quot;m in need, for I have learned to be satisfied in any circumstance.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">You&amp;quot;ve so graciously provided for my essential needs during this season of difficulty.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">For I want you to know that the Philippian church was the only church that supported me in the beginning as I went out to preach the gospel. You were the only church that sowed into me financially,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">and when I was in Thessalonica, you supported me for well over a year.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">I mention this not because I&amp;quot;m requesting a gift, but so that the fruit of your generosity may bring you an abundant reward.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">I now have all I need&amp;ndash;more than enough&amp;ndash;I&amp;quot;m abundantly satisfied! For I&amp;quot;ve received the gift you sent by Epaphroditus and viewed it as a sweet sacrifice, perfumed with the fragrance of your faithfulness , which is so pleasing to God!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">I am convinced that my God will fully satisfy every need you have, for I have seen the abundant riches of glory revealed to me through Jesus Christ!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">And God our Father will receive all the glory and the honor throughout the eternity of eternities! Amen!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Give my warm greetings to all the believers in Christ Jesus.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="8">Beware that no one distracts you or intimidates you in their attempt to lead you away from Christ&amp;quot;s fullness by pretending to be full of wisdom when they&amp;quot;re filled with endless arguments of human logic. For they operate with humanistic and clouded judgments based on the mindset of this world system, and not the anointed truths of the Anointed One.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="12">For we&amp;quot;ve been buried with him into his death. Our &amp;apos;baptism into death&amp;apos; also means we were raised with him when we believed in God&amp;quot;s resurrection power, the power that raised him from death&amp;quot;s realm.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">This &amp;apos;realm of death&amp;apos; describes our former state, for we were held in sin&amp;quot;s grasp. But now, we&amp;quot;ve been resurrected out of that &amp;apos;realm of death&amp;apos; never to return, for we are forever alive and forgiven of all our sins!</VERS>

He erased it all&amp;ndash;our sins, our stained soul&amp;ndash;he deleted it all and they cannot be retrieved ! Everything we once were in Adam has been placed onto his cross and nailed permanently there as a public display of cancellation.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Then Jesus made a public spectacle of all the powers and principalities of darkness, stripping away from them every weapon and all their spiritual authority and power to accuse us. And by the power of the cross, Jesus led them around as prisoners in a procession of triumph. He was not their prisoner; they were his!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">So why would you allow anyone to judge you because of what you eat or drink, or insist that you keep the feasts, observe new moon celebrations, or the Sabbath?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">All of these were but a prophetic shadow and the evidence of what would be fulfilled, for the body is now Christ!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Don&amp;quot;t let anyone disqualify you from your prize! Don&amp;quot;t let their pretended sincerity fool you as they deliberately lead you into their initiation of angel worship. For they take pleasure in pretending to be experts of something they know nothing about. Their reasoning is meaningless and comes only from their own opinions.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">They refuse to take hold of the true source. But we receive directly from him , and his life supplies vitality into every part of his body through the joining ligaments connecting us all as one. He is the divine Head who guides his body and causes it to grow by the supernatural power of God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">For you were included in the death of Christ and have died with him to the religious system and powers of this world. Don&amp;quot;t retreat back to being bullied by the standards and opinions of religion&amp;ndash;</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="2">We are grateful to God for your lives and we always pray for you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">For we remember before our God and Father how you put your faith into practice, how your love motivates you to serve others, and how unrelenting is your hope-filled patience in our Lord Jesus Christ.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Dear brothers and sisters, you are dearly loved by God and we know that he has chosen you to be his very own.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">For our gospel came to you not merely in the form of words but in mighty power infused with the Holy Spirit and deep conviction. Surely you remember how we lived our lives transparently before you to encourage you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">And you became followers of my example and the Lord&amp;quot;s when you received the word with the joy of the Holy Spirit, even though it resulted in tremendous trials and persecution.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Now you have become an example for all the believers to follow throughout the provinces of Greece.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">The message of the Lord has sounded out from you not only in Greece, but its echo has been heard in every place where people are hearing about your strong faith. We don&amp;quot;t need to brag on you,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">for everyone tells the story of the kind of welcome you showed us when we first came to you. And everyone knows how wonderfully you turned to God from idols to serve the true and living God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">And now you eagerly expect his Son from heaven&amp;ndash;Jesus, the deliverer, whom he raised from the dead and who rescues us from the coming wrath.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="2">
			<VERS vnumber="1">My dear brothers and sisters, it&amp;quot;s obvious that our ministry among you has proven to be fruitful.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">And though we had already suffered greatly in Philippi, where we were shamefully mistreated, we were emboldened by faith in our God to fearlessly preach his wonderful gospel to you in spite of incredible opposition.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Our coming alongside you to encourage you was not out of some delusion, or impure motive, or an intention to mislead you,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">but we have been approved by God to be those who preach the gospel. So our motivation to preach is not pleasing people but pleasing God, who thoroughly examines our hearts.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">God is our witness that when we came to encourage you, we never once used cunning compliments as a pretext for greed,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">nor did we crave the praises of men, whether you or others.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Even though we could have imposed upon you our demands as apostles of Christ, instead we showed you kindness and were gentle among you. We cared for you in the same way a nursing mother cares for her own children.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">With a mother&amp;quot;s love and affectionate attachment to you, we were very happy to share with you not only the gospel of God but also our lives&amp;ndash;because you had become so dear to us.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Beloved brothers and sisters, surely you remember how hard we labored among you. We worked night and day so that we would not become a burden to you while we preached the wonderful gospel of God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">With God as our witness you saw how we lived among you&amp;ndash;in holiness, in godly relationships, and without fault.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">And you know how affectionately we treated each one of you, like a loving father cares for his own children.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">We comforted and encouraged you and challenged you to adopt a lifestyle worthy of God, who invites you into his kingdom and glory.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">This is why we continually thank God for your lives , because you received our message wholeheartedly . You embraced it not as the fabrication of men but as the word of God. And the word continues to be an energizing force in you who believe.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">My dear brothers and sisters, the same thing happened to you as happened to God&amp;quot;s churches in Christ Jesus that are in Judea. For you received the same kind of mistreatment from your fellow countrymen as they did from theirs, the Jews</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">who killed both the Lord Jesus and the prophets and ran us out of town. They are offending God and hostile to everyone else</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">by hindering us from speaking to the unbelievers so that they might be saved. By so doing they are constantly filling up to the brim the measure of their guilt, and punishment has come upon them at last!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Beloved friends, we may have been torn away from you physically for a season, but never in our hearts. For we have had intense longings and have endeavored to come and see in your faces the reflection of this great love.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">We miss you badly , and I personally wanted to come to you, trying again and again, but our adversary, Satan, blocked our way.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">For what will be our confident hope, our exhilarating joy, or our wonderful trophy that we will boast in before our Lord Jesus at his appearing? It is you!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Yes, you are our glorious pride and joy!</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="3">
			<VERS vnumber="1">When we could bear it no longer, we decided that we would remain in Athens</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">and send Timothy in our place . He is our beloved brother and coworker with God in preaching the gospel. We knew he would strengthen your faith and encourage your hearts</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">so that no one would be shaken by these persecutions, for you know that we are destined for this.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">In fact, when we were with you we forewarned you: &amp;apos;Suffering and persecution is coming.&amp;apos; And so it has happened, as you well know.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">For this reason, when I could endure it no longer, I sent our brother to find out if your faith was still strong, for I was concerned that the tempter had somehow enticed you and our labor would have been in vain.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">But now, Timothy has just returned to us and brought us the terrific news of your faith and love. He informed us that you still hold us dear in your hearts and that you long to see us as much as we long to see you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">So, our dear brothers and sisters, in the midst of all our distress and difficulties, your steadfastness of faith has greatly encouraged our hearts.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">We feel alive again as long as we know that you are standing firm in the Lord.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">How could we ever thank God enough for all the wonderful joy that we feel before our God because of you?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Every night and day we sincerely and fervently pray that we may see you face-to-face and furnish you with whatever may be lacking in your faith.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Now may our Father God and our precious Lord Jesus guide our steps on a path straight back to you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">And may the Lord increase your love until it overflows toward one another and for all people, just as our love overflows toward you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Then your hearts will be strengthened in holiness so that you may be flawless and pure before the face of our God and Father at the appearing of our Lord Jesus with all his holy ones. Amen!</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="4">
			<VERS vnumber="1">And now, beloved brothers and sisters, since you have been mentored by us with respect to living for God and pleasing him, I appeal to you in the name of the Lord Jesus with this request: keep faithfully growing through our teachings even more and more.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">For you already know the instructions we&amp;quot;ve shared with you through the Lord Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">God&amp;quot;s will is for you to be set apart for him in holiness and that you keep yourselves unpolluted from sexual defilement.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Yes, each of you must guard your sexual purity with holiness and dignity,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">not yielding to lustful passions like those who don&amp;quot;t know God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Never take selfish advantage of a brother or sister in this matter, for we&amp;quot;ve already told you and solemnly warned you that the Lord is the avenger in all these things.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">For God&amp;quot;s call on our lives is not to a life of compromise and perversion but to a life surrounded in holiness.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Therefore, whoever rejects this instruction isn&amp;quot;t rejecting human authority but God himself, who gives us his precious gift &amp;ndash;his Spirit of holiness.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">There&amp;quot;s no need for anyone to say much to you about loving your fellow believers, for God is continually teaching you to unselfishly love one another.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Indeed, your love is what you&amp;quot;re known for throughout Macedonia. We urge you, beloved ones, to let this unselfish love increase and flow through you more and more.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Aspire to lead a calm and peaceful life as you mind your own business and earn your living, just as we&amp;quot;ve taught you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">By doing this you will live an honorable life, influencing others and commanding respect of even the unbelievers. Then you&amp;quot;ll be in need of nothing and not dependent upon others.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Beloved brothers and sisters, we want you to be quite certain about the truth concerning those who have passed away, so that you won&amp;quot;t be overwhelmed with grief like many others who have no hope.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, we also believe that God will bring with Jesus those who died while believing in him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">This is the word of the Lord: we who are alive in him and remain until the Lord appears will by no means have an advantage over those who have already died, for both will rise together .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">For the Lord himself will appear with the declaration of victory, the shout of an archangel, and the trumpet blast of God. He will descend from the heavenly realm and command those who are dead in Christ to rise first.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Then we who are alive will join them, transported together in clouds to have an encounter with the Lord in the air, and we will be forever joined with the Lord.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">So encourage one another with these truths.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="5">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Now, beloved brothers and sisters, concerning the question of God&amp;quot;s precise times and specific seasons, you don&amp;quot;t need me to write anything to you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">For you already know quite well that the day of the Lord will come unexpectedly and as a complete surprise.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">For while some are saying, &amp;apos;Finally we have peace and security,&amp;apos; sudden destruction will arrive at their doorstep, like labor pains seizing a pregnant woman&amp;ndash;and with no chance of escape!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">But you, beloved brothers and sisters, are not living in the dark, allowing that day to creep up on you like a thief coming to steal .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">For you are all children of the light and children of the day. We don&amp;quot;t belong to the night nor to darkness.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">This is why we must not fall asleep, as the rest do, but keep wide awake and clearheaded.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">For those who are asleep sleep the night away, and drunkards get drunk at night.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">But since we belong to the day, we must stay alert and clearheaded by placing the breastplate of faith and love over our hearts , and a helmet of the hope of salvation over our thoughts .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">For God has not destined us for wrath but to possess salvation through our Lord Jesus, the Anointed One.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">He gave his life for us so that we may share in resurrection life in union with him&amp;ndash;whether we&amp;quot;re awake or asleep.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Because of this, encourage the hearts of your fellow believers and support one another, just as you have already been doing.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Dear brothers and sisters, make sure that you show your deep appreciation for those who cherish you and diligently work as ministers among you. For they are your leaders who care for you, teach you, and stand before the Lord on your behalf.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">They value you with great love. Because of their service to you, let peace reign among yourselves.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">We appeal to you, dear brothers and sisters, to instruct those who are not in their place of battle. Be skilled at gently encouraging those who feel themselves inadequate. Be faithful to stand your ground. Help the weak to stand again. Be quick to demonstrate patience with everyone.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Resist revenge, and make sure that no one pays back evil in place of evil but always pursue doing what is beautiful to one another and to all the unbelievers .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Let joy be your continual feast.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Make your life a prayer.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">And in the midst of everything be always giving thanks, for this is God&amp;quot;s perfect plan for you in Christ Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Never restrain or put out the fire of the Holy Spirit.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">And don&amp;quot;t be one who scorns prophecies,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">but be faithful to examine them by putting them to the test, and afterward hold tightly to what has proven to be right.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Avoid every appearance of evil.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">Now, may the God of peace and harmony set you apart, making you completely holy. And may your entire being&amp;ndash;spirit, soul, and body&amp;ndash;be kept completely flawless in the appearing of our Lord Jesus, the Anointed One.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">The one who calls you by name is trustworthy and will thoroughly complete his work in you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">Now, beloved ones, pray for us.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">Greet every brother and sister with a sacred kiss.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">I solemnly plead with you before the Lord to make sure that every holy believer among you has the opportunity to hear this letter read to them.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="6">Now you are aware of the ruling power so that he may be fully revealed when his time comes.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="8">Then the &amp;apos;outlaw&amp;apos; will be openly revealed, and the Lord will overthrow him by the breath of his mouth and bring him to an end by the dazzling manifestation of his presence.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">The presence of the &amp;apos;outlaw&amp;apos; is apparent by the activity of Satan, who uses all kinds of counterfeit miracles, signs, spurious wonders,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">and every form of evil deception in order to deceive those who are perishing because they rejected the love of the truth that would lead them to being saved.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Because of this, God sends them a powerful delusion that leads them to believe what is false.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="13">Mercy kissed me, even though I used to be a blasphemer, a persecutor of believers, and a scorner of what turned out to be true. I was ignorant and didn&amp;quot;t know what I was doing.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">I was flooded with such incredible grace, like a river overflowing its banks , until I was full of faith and love for Jesus, the Anointed One!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">I can testify that the Word is true and deserves to be received by all, for Jesus Christ came into the world to bring sinners back to life&amp;ndash;even me, the worst sinner of all!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Yet I was captured by grace, so that Jesus Christ could display through me the outpouring of his Spirit as a pattern to be seen for all those who would believe in him for eternal life.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Because of this my praises rise to the King of all the universe who is indestructible, invisible, and full of glory, the only God who is worthy of the highest honors throughout all of time and throughout the eternity of eternities! Amen!</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="7">I have been divinely called as an apostle to preach this revelation, which is the truth. God has called me to be a trustworthy teacher to the nations.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Therefore, I encourage the men to pray on every occasion with hands lifted to God in worship with clean hearts, free from frustration or strife.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">And that the women would also pray with clean hearts, dressed appropriately and adorned modestly and sensibly, not flaunting their wealth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">But they should be recognized instead by their beautiful deeds of kindness, suitable as one who worships God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Let the women who are new converts be willing to learn with all submission to their leaders and not speak out of turn.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">I don&amp;quot;t advocate that the newly converted women be the teachers in the church, assuming authority over the men, but to live in peace.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">For God formed Adam first, then Eve.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Adam did not mislead Eve, but Eve misled him and violated the command of God.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1">If any of you aspires to be an overseer in the church; you have set your heart toward a noble ambition, for the word is true!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Yet an elder needs to be one who is without blame before others. He should be one whose heart is for his wife alone and not another woman . He should be recognized as one who is sensible, and well-behaved, and living a disciplined life. He should be a &amp;apos;spiritual shepherd&amp;apos; who has the gift of teaching, and is known for his hospitality. and as our great High Priest in the Spirit!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">He cannot be a drunkard, or someone who lashes out at others, or argumentative, or someone who simply craves more money, but instead, recognized by his gentleness.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">His heart should be set on guiding his household with wisdom and dignity; bringing up his children to worship with devotion and purity.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">For if he&amp;quot;s unable to properly lead his own household well, how could he properly lead God&amp;quot;s household?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">He should not be a new disciple who would be vulnerable to living in the clouds of conceit and fall into pride, making him easy prey for Satan.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">He should be respected by those who are unbelievers, having a beautiful testimony among them so that he will not fall into the traps of Satan and be disgraced.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">And in the same way the deacons must be those who are pure and true to their word, not addicted to wine, or with greedy eyes on the contributions.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Instead, they must faithfully embrace the mysteries of faith while keeping a clean conscience.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">And each of them must be found trustworthy according to these standards before they are given the responsibility to minister as servant-leaders without blame.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1">The Holy Spirit has explicitly revealed: At the end of this age, many will depart from the true faith one after another, devoting themselves to spirits of deception and following demon-inspired revelations and theories.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Hypocritical liars will deceive many, and their consciences won&amp;quot;t bother them at all!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">They will require celibacy and dietary restrictions that God doesn&amp;quot;t expect, for he created all foods to be received with the celebration of faith by those who fully know the truth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">We know that all creation is beautiful to God and there is nothing to be refused if it is received with gratitude.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">All that we eat is made sacred by the Word of God and prayer.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="8">For athletic training only benefits you for a short season, but righteousness brings lasting benefit in everything; for righteousness contains the promise of life, for time and eternity.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Faithful is the Word, and everyone should accept him!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">For the sake of this ministry, we toil tirelessly and are criticized continually, simply because our hope is in the living God. He is the wonderful life-giver of all the children of men, and even more so to those who believe.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1">Don&amp;quot;t be harsh or verbally abusive to an older man; it is better to appeal to him as a father. And as you minister to the younger men it is best to encourage them as your dear brothers.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Honor the older women as mothers, and the younger women, treat as your dear sisters with utmost purity.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">The church needs to honor and support the widows, especially those who are in dire need.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">But if they have children or grandchildren at home, then it is only proper to let them provide for the ones who raised them when they were children, for kindness begins at home and it pleases God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">For the true widow is all alone and has placed her complete hope in God. She is Messiah&amp;quot;s missionary and will need the support of the church as one who remains in prayer day and night.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">But the widow who serves only herself lives a life of self-indulgence and is wasting her life away.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Be sure to give clear instruction concerning these matters so that none of them will live with shame.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">For if a believer fails to provide for their own relatives when they are in need, they have compromised their convictions of faith and need to be corrected , for they are living worse than the unbelievers.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">The widows who are worthy to be supported by the church should be at least sixty years old and not remarried.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">They should have a beautiful testimony of raising their families, practicing hospitality, encouraging other believers, comforting troubled ones, and have a reputation for doing good works.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">But you need not concern yourself with the younger widows, for some will depart from the Messiah because of their desire to remarry.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">For they will face their own punishment of living with a disturbed conscience for invalidating their former faith.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Those widows who go around from house to house as busybodies are only learning to be lazy, making their situation even worse by talking too much, gossiping, and speaking things they shouldn&amp;quot;t. They become far too obsessed with empty things that will not bear good fruit.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">For this reason, teach the younger women to remarry and bear children and care for their household. This will keep them from giving our adversary a reason to gloat.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">For there are already those who have begun to turn aside from their faith and are influenced by Satan.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">So if any believer has a widow in their family, instruct them to support her financially so that the church will not be burdened with her care. This will leave finances available for those widows who are truly in need.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">The pastors who lead the church well should be paid well. They should receive double honor for faithfully preaching and teaching the revelation of the Word of God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">For the Scriptures have taught us: &amp;apos;Do not muzzle an ox or forbid it to eat while it grinds the grain.&amp;apos; And also, &amp;apos;The one who labors deserves his wages.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Refuse to listen to suspicious accusations against the pastors who lead the flock unless you have two or three witnesses to confirm the accusations .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">But if indeed you find that they have sinned, bring correction to them before the congregation so that the rest of the people will respect you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Timothy, in the presence of God and our Lord Jesus Christ, and before the chosen messengers, I solemnly charge you to put into practice all these matters without bias, prejudice, or favoritism.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Don&amp;quot;t be hasty to ordain them with the laying on of hands, or you may end up sharing in their guilt should they fall. Keep yourself pure and holy with your standards high.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">(If drinking the water causes you to have stomach ailments, drink some wine instead.)</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">The sins of some people stand out and are well known. Yet there are others whose sins are not as obvious, but the truth of who they really are will eventually be seen and will bring them judgment.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">It is the same way with good works, even if they are not known at first, they will eventually be recognized and acknowledged.</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="6">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Instruct every employee to respect and honor their employers, for this attitude presents to them a clear testimony of God&amp;quot;s truth and renown. Tell them to never provide them with a reason to discredit God&amp;quot;s name because of their actions.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Especially honor and respect employers who are believers and don&amp;quot;t despise them, but serve them even more, for they are fellow believers. They should be at peace with them as beloved members of God&amp;quot;s family. Be faithful to teach them these things as their sacred obligation.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">But if anyone spreads false teaching that does not agree with the healthy instruction of our Lord Jesus, teaching others that holy awe of God is not important, then they prove they know nothing at all! It&amp;quot;s obvious they don&amp;quot;t value or hold dear the healing words of our Lord Jesus Christ.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">They are covered with the clouds of conceit. They are loaded with controversy, and they love to argue their opinions and split hairs. The fruit of their ministry is contention, competition, and evil suspicions.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">They add misery to many lives by corrupting their minds and cheating them of the truth. They equate the worship of God with making great sums of money.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">We have a &amp;apos;profit&amp;apos; that is greater than theirs&amp;ndash;our holy awe of God! To have merely our necessities is to have enough.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Isn&amp;quot;t it true that our hands were empty when we came into the world, and when we leave this world our hands will be empty again?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Because of this, food and clothing is enough to make us content.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">But those who crave the wealth of this world slip into spiritual snares. They become trapped by the troubles that come through their foolish and harmful desires, driven by greed and drowning in their own sinful pleasures. And they take others down with them into their corruption and eventual destruction.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Loving money is a root of all evils. Some people run after it so much that they have given up their faith. Craving more money pushes them away from the faith into error, compounding misery in their lives!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Timothy, you are God&amp;quot;s man, so run from all these errors. Instead, chase after true holiness, justice, faithfulness, love, hope, and tender humility.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">So fight with faith for the winner&amp;quot;s prize! Lay your hands upon eternal life, to which you were called and about which you made the good confession before the multitude of witnesses!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">So now, I instruct you before the God of resurrection life and before Jesus, the Anointed One, who demonstrated a beautiful testimony even before Pontius Pilate,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">that you follow this commission faithfully with a clear conscience and without blemish until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Yes, God will make his appearing in his own divine timing, for he is the exalted God, the only powerful One, the King over every king, and the Lord of power!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">He alone is the immortal God, living in the unapproachable light of divine glory! No one has ever seen his fullness, nor can they, for all the glory and endless authority of the universe belongs to him, forever and ever. Amen!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">To all the rich of this world, I command you not to be wrapped in thoughts of pride over your prosperity, or rely on your wealth, for your riches are unreliable and nothing compared to the living God. Trust instead in the one who lavishes upon us all good things, fulfilling our every need.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Remind the wealthy to be rich in remarkable works of extravagant generosity, willing to share with others.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">These spiritual investments will provide a beautiful foundation for their lives and secure for them a great future, as they lay their hands upon the meaning of true life.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">So, my son Timothy, don&amp;quot;t forget all that has been deposited within you. Escape from the empty echoes of men and the perversion of twisted reasoning.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">For those who claim to possess this so-called knowledge have already wandered from the true faith. May God&amp;quot;s grace empower you always! Love in Christ , Paul</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="15">Perhaps you&amp;quot;ve heard that Phygelus, and Hermogenes and all the believers of Asia have deserted me because of my imprisonment.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Nevertheless, so many times Onesiphorus was like a breath of fresh air to me and never seemed to be ashamed of my chains. May our Lord Jesus bestow compassion and mercy upon him and his household.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="5">The reason I stationed you in Crete was so that you could set things in order and complete what was left unfinished, and to raise up and appoint church elders in every city, just as I had instructed you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Each of them must be above reproach, devoted solely to his wife, whose children are believers and not rebellious or out of control.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">The overseer, since he serves God&amp;quot;s household, must be someone of blameless character and not be opinionated or short-tempered. He must not be a drunkard or violent or greedy.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Instead he should be one who is known for his hospitality and a lover of goodness. He should be recognized as one who is fair-minded, pure-hearted, and self-controlled.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">He must have a firm grasp of the trustworthy message that he has been taught. This will enable him to both encourage others with healthy teachings and provide convincing answers to those who oppose his message.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">There are many wayward people, smooth talkers, and deceivers&amp;ndash;especially the converts from Judaism.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">They must be silenced because they are disrupting entire families with their corrupt teachings, all for their dishonest greed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">A certain one of them, one of their own prophets, said, &amp;apos;Those Cretans are nothing but liars, worthless beasts, and lazy gluttons.&amp;apos;</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="2">To the church that meets in his house, along with our dear sister Apphia and our fellow soldier Archippus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">May God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ pour out his grace and peace upon you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">I am always thankful to my God as I remember you in my prayers</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">because I&amp;quot;m hearing reports about your faith in the Lord Jesus and how much love you have for all his holy followers.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">I pray for you that the faith we share may effectively deepen your understanding of every good thing that belongs to you in Christ.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Your love has impacted me and brings me great joy and encouragement, for the hearts of the believers have been greatly refreshed through you, dear brother.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Even though I have enough boldness in Christ that I could command you to do what is proper,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Formerly he was not useful or valuable to you, but now he is valuable to both of us.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">He is my very heart, and I&amp;quot;ve sent him back to you with this letter .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">I would have preferred to keep him at my side so that he could take your place as my helper during my imprisonment for the sake of the gospel.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">However, I did not want to make this decision without your consent, so that your act of kindness would not be a matter of obligation but out of willingness.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Perhaps you could think of it this way : he was separated from you for a short time so that you could have him back forever.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">So welcome him no longer as a slave, but more than that, as a dearly loved brother. He is that to me especially, and how much more so to you, both humanly speaking and in the Lord.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">So if you consider me your friend and partner, accept him the same way you would accept me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">And if he has stolen anything from you or owes you anything, just place it on my account.</VERS>

	<BIBLEBOOK bnumber="58" bname="Hebrews">
		<CHAPTER cnumber="1">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Throughout our history God has spoken to our ancestors by his prophets in many different ways. The revelation he gave them was only a fragment at a time, building one truth upon another .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">But to us living in these last days, God now speaks to us openly in the language of a Son, the appointed Heir of everything, for through him God created the panorama of all things and all time.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">The Son is the dazzling radiance of God&amp;quot;s splendor, the exact expression of God&amp;quot;s true nature&amp;ndash;his mirror image! He holds the universe together and expands it by the mighty power of his spoken word. He accomplished for us the complete cleansing of sins, and then took his seat on the highest throne at the right hand of the majestic One.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">He is infinitely greater than angels, for he inherited a rank and a Name far greater than theirs.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">For God has never said to any angel what he said to Jesus: &amp;apos;You are my favored Son, today I have fathered you.&amp;apos; &amp;apos;I will be the Father to him, and he will be the Son to me.&amp;apos; and kiss him in worship.&amp;apos; and my ministers fiery flames.&amp;apos; with justice and righteousness, For this reason, God, your God, has anointed you and poured out the oil of bliss on you &amp;apos;Lord, you formed the earth in the beginning and with your own hands you crafted the cosmos. But you are &amp;quot;I AM.&amp;quot; You never change, years without end!&amp;apos; until I force your whispering enemies to be a rug under your feet.&amp;apos; And this: &amp;apos;Let all my angels bow down before him &amp;apos;I make my angels swift winds, &amp;apos;Your throne, O God, endures forever and ever and you will rule your kingdom and detested lawlessness. more than on any of your friends.&amp;apos; but you will remain forever! They will all fade like a worn-out garment, and you will fold them up and put them away. &amp;apos;Take your seat next to me at my right hand</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">And again, when he brought his firstborn Son into the world:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">And about his angels he says,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">But about his Son, he called him &amp;apos;God,&amp;apos; saying,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">For you have cherished righteousness</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">And he called him Lord, saying,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">They will both one day disappear,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">And they will be changed like clothes,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">And God has never said this to any of his angels:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">What role then, do the angels have? The angels are spirit-messengers sent by God to serve those who are going to be saved.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="2">
			<VERS vnumber="1">This is why it is so crucial that we be all the more engaged and attentive to the truths that we have heard so that we do not drift off course.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">For if the message of the law spoken and confirmed by angels brought a just penalty to every disobedient violation;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">then how would we expect to escape punishment if we despise the very truths that give us life? The Lord himself was the first to announce these things, and those who heard him firsthand confirmed their accuracy.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Then God added his witness to theirs. He validated their ministry with signs, astonishing wonders, all kinds of powerful miracles, and by the gifts of the Holy Spirit, which he distributed as he desired.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">For God will not place the coming world, of which we speak, under the government of angels.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">But the Scriptures affirm: What is man that you would even think about him, or care about Adam&amp;quot;s race. You placed your glory and honor upon his head as a crown. And you have given him dominion This means that God has left nothing outside the control of his Son, even if presently we have yet to see this accomplished. and I will glorify you with praises in the midst of the congregation.&amp;apos; And again he says,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">You made him lower than the angels for a little while. over the works of your hands, &amp;apos;I will reveal who you really are to my brothers and sisters, &amp;apos;My confidence rests in God!&amp;apos; &amp;apos;Here I am, one with the children Yahweh has given me.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">For you have placed everything under his authority.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">But we see Jesus, who as a man , lived for a short time lower than the angels and has now been crowned with glorious honor because of what he suffered in his death. For it was by God&amp;quot;s grace that he experienced death&amp;quot;s bitterness on behalf of everyone!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">For now he towers above all creation, for all things exist through him and for him. And that God made him, pioneer of our salvation, perfect through his sufferings, for this is how he brings many sons and daughters to share in his glory.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Jesus, the Holy One, makes us holy. And as sons and daughters, we now belong to his same Father, so he is not ashamed or embarrassed to introduce us as his brothers and sisters!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">For he has said,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">And,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Since all his &amp;apos;children&amp;apos; have flesh and blood, so Jesus became human to fully identify with us. He did this, so that he could experience death and annihilate the effects of the intimidating accuser who holds against us the power of death.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">By embracing death Jesus sets free those who live their entire lives in bondage to the tormenting dread of death.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">For it is clear that he didn&amp;quot;t do this for the angels, but for all the sons and daughters of Abraham.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">This is why he had to be a man and take hold of our humanity in every way. He made us his brothers and sisters and became our merciful and faithful King-Priest before God; as the One who removed our sins to make us one with him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">He suffered and endured every test and temptation, so that he can help us every time we pass through the ordeals of life.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="3">
			<VERS vnumber="1">And so, dear brothers and sisters, you are now made holy, and each of you is invited to the feast of your heavenly calling. So fasten your thoughts fully onto Jesus, whom we embrace as our Apostle and King-Priest.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">For he was faithful to the Father who appointed him, in the same way that Moses was a model of faithfulness in what was entrusted to him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">But Jesus is worthy to receive a much greater glory than Moses, for the one who builds a house deserves to be honored more than the house he builds.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Every house is built by someone, but God is the Designer and Builder of all things.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Indeed, Moses served God faithfully in all he gave him to do. His work prophetically illustrates things that would later be spoken and fulfilled.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">But Christ is more than a Servant, he was faithful as the Son in charge of God&amp;quot;s house. And now we are part of his house if we continue courageously to hold firmly to our bold confidence and our victorious hope.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">This is why the Holy Spirit says, &amp;apos;If only you would listen to his voice this day! like your ancestors did during the days of their rebellion, even though they saw my miracles for forty years they still doubted me ! Don&amp;quot;t make him angry by hardening your hearts,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Don&amp;quot;t make him angry by hardening your hearts, when they were tested in the wilderness. and I said about them, &amp;quot;They wander in their hearts just like they do with their feet, and they refuse to learn my ways.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;They will not enter into my rest!&amp;quot; &amp;apos; If only today you would listen to his voice. as you did in the wilderness rebellion.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">There your fathers tested me and tried my patience</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">This ignited my anger with that generation</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">My heart grieved over them so I decreed:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">So search your hearts every day, my brothers and sisters, and make sure that none of you has evil or unbelief hiding within you. For it will lead you astray, and make you unresponsive to the living God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">This is the time to encourage each other to never be stubborn or hardened by sin&amp;quot;s deceitfulness.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">For we are mingled with the Messiah, if we will continue unshaken in this confident assurance from the beginning until the end.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">For again, the Scriptures say,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">The same people who were delivered from bondage and brought out of Egypt by Moses, were the ones who heard and still rebelled.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">They grieved God for forty years by sinning in their unbelief, until they dropped dead in the desert.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">So God swore an oath that they would never enter into his calming place of rest all because they disobeyed him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">It is clear that they could not enter into their inheritance because they wrapped their hearts in unbelief.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="4">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Now the promise of entering into God&amp;quot;s rest is still for us today. So we must be extremely careful to ensure that we all embrace the fullness of that promise and not fail to experience it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">For we have heard the good news of deliverance just as they did, yet they didn&amp;quot;t join their faith with the Word. Instead, what they heard didn&amp;quot;t affect them deeply, for they doubted.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">For those of us who believe, faith activates the promise and we experience the realm of confident rest! For he has said, &amp;apos;I was grieved with them and made a solemn oath, God&amp;quot;s works have all been completed from the foundation of the world, &amp;quot;They will not enter into my rest.&amp;quot; &amp;apos; And on the seventh day God rested from all his works. They will not enter into my rest. &amp;apos;If only today you would listen to his voice and do not harden your hearts!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">for it says in the Scriptures,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">And again, as stated before,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Those who first heard the good news of deliverance failed to enter into that realm of faith&amp;quot;s rest because of their unbelieving hearts. Yet the fact remains that we still have the opportunity to enter into the faith-rest life and experience the fulfillment of the promise!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">For God still has ordained a day for us to enter into called &amp;apos;Today.&amp;apos; For it was long afterwards that God repeated it in David&amp;quot;s words,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Now if this promise of &amp;apos;rest&amp;apos; was fulfilled when Joshua brought the people into the land, God wouldn&amp;quot;t have spoken later of another &amp;apos;rest&amp;apos; yet to come.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">So we conclude that there is still a full and complete Sabbath-rest waiting for believers to experience.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">As we enter into God&amp;quot;s faith-rest life we cease from our own works, just as God celebrates his finished works and rests in them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">So then we must be eager to experience this faith-rest life, so that no one falls short by following the same pattern of doubt and unbelief.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">For we have the living Word of God, which is full of energy, like a two-mouthed sword. It will even penetrate to the very core of our being where soul and spirit, bone and marrow meet! It interprets and reveals the true thoughts and secret motives of our hearts.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">There is not one person who can hide their thoughts from God, for nothing that we do remains a secret, and nothing created is concealed, but everything is exposed and defenseless before his eyes, to whom we must render an account.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">So then, we must cling in faith to all we know to be true. For we have a magnificent King-Priest, Jesus Christ, the Son of God, who rose into the heavenly realm for us, and now sympathizes with us in our frailty.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">He understands humanity, for as a man, our magnificent King-Priest was tempted in every way just as we are, and conquered sin.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">So now we draw near freely and boldly to where grace is enthroned, to receive mercy&amp;quot;s kiss and discover the grace we urgently need to strengthen us in our time of weakness.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="5">
			<VERS vnumber="1">For every High Priest was chosen from among the people and appointed to represent them before God by presenting their gifts to God and offering sacrifices on their behalf.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Since the High Priest is also one who is clothed in weakness, he humbles himself by showing compassion to those who are ignorant of God&amp;quot;s ways and stray from them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">And for this reason, he has to not only present the sin offerings of others, but also to bring a sin offering for himself.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">And no one takes this honor upon himself by being self-appointed, but God is the one who calls each one, just as Aaron was called.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">So also, Christ was not self-appointed and did not glorify himself by becoming a high priest, but God called and glorified him! For the Father said to him, &amp;apos;You are my favored Son. Today I have fathered you.&amp;apos; &amp;apos;You are a Priest like Melchizedek, a King-Priest forever!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">And in another Scripture he says about this new priestly order,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">During Christ&amp;quot;s days on earth he pleaded with God, praying with passion and with tearful agony that God would spare him from death. And because of his perfect devotion his prayer was answered and he was delivered.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">But even though he was a wonderful Son, he learned to listen and obey through all his sufferings.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">And after being proven perfect in this way he has now become the source of eternal salvation to all those who listen to him and obey.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">For God has designated him as the King-Priest who is over the priestly order of Melchizedek.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">We have much to say about this topic although it is difficult to explain, because you have become too dull and sluggish to understand.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">For you should already be professors instructing others by now; but instead, you need to be taught from the beginning the basics of God&amp;quot;s prophetic oracles! You&amp;quot;re like children still needing milk and not yet ready to digest solid food.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">For every spiritual infant who lives on milk is not yet pierced by the revelation of righteousness.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">But solid food is for the mature, whose spiritual senses perceive heavenly matters . And they have been adequately trained by what they&amp;quot;ve experienced to emerge with understanding of the difference between what is truly excellent and what is evil and harmful.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="6">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Now is the time for us to progress beyond the basic message of Christ and advance into perfection. The foundation has already been laid for us to build upon: turning away from our dead works to embrace faith in God,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">teaching about different baptisms, impartation by the laying on of hands, resurrection of the dead, and eternal judgment.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">So with God&amp;quot;s enablement we will move on to deeper truths.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">It is impossible to restore an apostate. For once a person has come into God&amp;quot;s light, and tasted the gifts of the heavenly realm, and has received the Holy Spirit,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">and feasted on the good Word of God, and has entered into the power of the age that is breaking in,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">if he abandons his faith, there is no use even trying to lead him to repentance. By their sin of apostasy they re-crucify the Son of God, and have publicly repudiated him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">For men&amp;quot;s hearts are just like the soil that drinks up the showers which often fall upon it. Some soil will yield crops as God&amp;quot;s blessing upon the field.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">But if the field continues to produce only thorns and thistles a curse hangs over it and it will be burned.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Even though we speak like this, beloved, we are fully convinced that there are more beautiful and excellent things, which flow from your salvation.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">For God, the Faithful One, is not unfair. How can he forget the beautiful work you have done for him? He remembers the love you demonstrate as you continually serve his beloved ones for the glory of his name.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">But we long to see you passionately advance until the end and you find your hope fulfilled.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">So don&amp;quot;t allow your hearts to grow dull or lose your enthusiasm, but follow the example of those who fully received what God has promised because of their strong faith and patient endurance.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Now when God made a promise to Abraham, since there was no one greater than himself, he swore an oath on his own integrity to keep the promise as sure as God exists!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">So he said, &amp;apos;Have no doubt, I promise to bless you over and over, and give you a son and multiply you without measure!&amp;apos; And now we have run into his heart to hide ourselves in his faithfulness. This is where we find his strength and comfort, for he empowers us to seize what has already been established ahead of time&amp;ndash;an unshakable hope!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">So Abraham waited patiently in faith and succeeded in seeing the promise fulfilled.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">It is very common for people to swear an oath by something greater than themselves, for the oath will confirm their statements and end all dispute.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">So in the same way, God wanted to end all doubt and confirm it even more forcefully to those who would inherit his promises. His purpose was unchangeable, so God added his vow to the promise.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">So it is impossible for God to lie for we know that his promise and his vow will never change!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">We have this certain hope like a strong, unbreakable anchor holding our souls to God himself. Our anchor of hope is fastened to the mercy seat in the heavenly realm beyond the sacred threshold,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">and where Jesus, our forerunner, has gone in before us. He is now and forever our royal Priest like Melchizedek.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="7">
			<VERS vnumber="3">This Melchizedek has no father or mother, and no record of any of his ancestors. He was never born and he never died, but his life is like a picture of the Son of God, a King-Priest forever!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Now let me show you proof of how great this Melchizedek is: &amp;ndash; Even though Abraham was the most honored and favored patriarch of all God&amp;quot;s chosen ones, he gave a tithe of the spoils of battle to Melchizedek. &amp;apos;You are a King-Priest forever!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">It would be understandable if Melchizedek had been a Jewish priest, for later on God&amp;quot;s people were required by law to support their priests financially, because the priests were their relatives and Abraham&amp;quot;s descendants.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">But Melchizedek was not Abraham&amp;quot;s Jewish relative, and yet Abraham still paid him a tithe. &amp;ndash; Melchizedek imparted a blessing on mighty Abraham, who had received the promises of God. &amp;ndash; &amp;ndash; &amp;ndash; &amp;ndash; You are like Melchizedek, a King-Priest forever! The Lord has made a solemn oath and will never change his mind,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">And no one could deny the fact that the one who has the power to impart a blessing is superior to the one who receives it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Although the Jewish priests received tithes, they all died&amp;ndash;they were mortal. But Melchizedek lives on!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">It could even be said that Levi, the ancestor of every Jewish priest who received tithes, actually paid tithes to Melchizedek through Abraham.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">For although Levi was yet unborn, the seed from which Levi came was present in Abraham when he paid his tithe to Melchizedek.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">If any of the Levitical priests who served under the law had the power to bring us into perfection, then why did God send Christ as Priest after the likeness of Melchizedek? He should have said, &amp;apos;After the likeness of Aaron.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">And furthermore, for God to send a new and different rank of priest, meant a new law would have had to be instituted even to allow it!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Yet the One these things all point to, was from a different tribe and no one from that tribe ever officiated at God&amp;quot;s altar,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">for we all know that our Lord didn&amp;quot;t descend from the tribe of Levi, but shined from the tribe of Judah. And Moses himself never said anything of a priest in connection with Judah&amp;quot;s tribe.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">And all this is made even clearer if there was another King-Priest raised up with the rank of Melchizedek.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">This King-Priest did not arise because of a genealogical right under the law to be a priest, but by the power of an indestructible, resurrection life!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">For it says in the Psalms,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">The old order of priesthood has been set aside as weak and powerless.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">For the law has never made anyone perfect, but in its place is a far better hope which gives us confidence to experience intimacy with God!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">And he confirmed it to us with his solemn vow. For the former priests took their office without an oath,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">but with Jesus, God affirmed his royal-priesthood with his promise, saying,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">So all of this magnifies the truth that we have a superior covenant with God than what they experienced, for Jesus himself is its guarantor!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">As additional proof, we know there were many priests under the old system, for they eventually died and their office had to be filled by another.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">But Jesus permanently holds his priestly office, since he lives forever and will never have a successor!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">So he is able to save fully from now throughout eternity, everyone who comes to God through him, because he lives to pray continually for them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">He is the High Priest who perfectly fits our need&amp;ndash;holy, without a trace of evil, without the ability to deceive, incapable of sin, and exalted beyond the heavens!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">Unlike the former high priests, he is not compelled to offer daily sacrifices. They had to bring a sacrifice first for their own sins, then for the sins of the people, but he finished the sacrificial system, once and for all, when he offered himself.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">The law appointed flawed men as high priests, but God&amp;quot;s promise, sealed with his oath, which succeeded the law, appoints a perfect Son who is complete forever!</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="8">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Now this is the crowning point of what we are saying: We have a magnificent King-Priest who ministers for us at the right hand of God. He is enthroned with honor next to the throne of the Majesty on high.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">He serves in the holy sanctuary in the true heavenly tabernacle set up by God, and not by men.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Since every high priest is appointed to offer both gifts and sacrifices, so the Messiah also had to bring some sacrifice.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">But since he didn&amp;quot;t qualify to be an earthly priest, and there are already priests who offer sacrifices prescribed by the law, he offered in heaven a perfect sacrifice .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">The priests on earth serve in a temple that is but a copy modeled after the heavenly sanctuary; a shadow of the reality. For when Moses began to construct the tabernacle God warned him and said, &amp;apos;You must precisely follow the pattern I revealed to you on Mount Sinai.&amp;apos; by giving them a new covenant. from the most unlikely to the most distinguished. and will forgive their evil deeds,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">But now Jesus the Messiah has accepted a priestly ministry which far surpasses theirs, since he is the catalyst of a better covenant which contains far more wonderful promises!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">For if that first covenant had been faultless no one would have needed a second one to replace it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">But God revealed the defect and limitation of the first when he said to his people, &amp;apos;Look! The day will come, declares the Lord, when I will satisfy the people of Israel and Judah than the one I made with their fathers when I led them by my hand out of Egypt. For they did not remain faithful to my covenant, so I rejected them, says the Lord God. I will embed my laws within their thoughts and fasten them onto their hearts. I will be their loyal God and they will be my loyal people. that everyone will know me as Lord! There will be no need at all to teach their fellow-citizens or brothers by saying, &amp;quot;You should know Yahweh ,&amp;quot; since everyone will know me inwardly , and never remember again their sins.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">It will be an entirely different covenant</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">For here is the covenant I will one day establish with the people of Israel:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">And the result of this will be</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">For I will demonstrate my mercy to them</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">This proves that by establishing this new covenant the first is now obsolete, ready to expire, and about to disappear.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="9">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Now in the first covenant there were specific rules for worship including a sanctuary on earth to worship in.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">When you entered the tabernacle you would first come into the holy chamber where you would find the lampstand and the bread of his presence on the fellowship table.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Then as you pass through the next curtain you would enter the innermost chamber called, the holiest sanctuary of all.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">It contained the golden altar of incense and the ark of covenant mercy, which was a wooden box covered entirely with gold. And placed inside the ark of covenant mercy was the golden jar with mystery-manna inside, Aaron&amp;quot;s resurrection rod, which had sprouted, and the stone tablets engraved with the covenant laws.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">On top of the lid of the ark were two cherubim, angels of splendor, with outstretched wings overshadowing the throne of mercy. But now is not the time to discuss further the significant details of these things.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">So with this prescribed pattern of worship the priests would routinely go in and out of the first chamber to perform their religious duties.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">And the high priest was permitted to enter into the Holiest Sanctuary of All only once a year and he could never enter without first offering sacrificial blood for both his own sins and for the sins of the people.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Now the Holy Spirit uses the symbols of this pattern of worship to reveal that the perfect way of holiness had not yet been unveiled. For as long as the tabernacle stood</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">it was an illustration that pointed to our present time of fulfillment , demonstrating that offerings and animal sacrifices had failed to perfectly cleanse the conscience of the worshiper.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">For this old pattern of worship was a matter of external rules and rituals concerning food and drink and ceremonial washings which was imposed upon us until the appointed time of heart-restoration had arrived.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">But now the Anointed One has become the King-Priest of every wonderful thing that has come. For he serves in a greater, more perfect heavenly tabernacle not made by men, that is to say, not a part of this creation.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">And he has entered once and forever into the Holiest Sanctuary of All, not with the blood of animal sacrifices, but the sacred blood of his own sacrifice. And he alone has made our salvation secure forever!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Under the old covenant the blood of bulls, goats, and the ashes of a heifer were sprinkled on those who were defiled and effectively cleansed them outwardly from their ceremonial impurities.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Yet how much more will the sacred blood of the Messiah thoroughly cleanse our consciences! For by the power of the eternal Spirit he has offered himself to God as the perfect Sacrifice that now frees us from our dead works to worship and serve the living God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">So Jesus is the One who has enacted a new covenant with a new relationship with God so that those who accept the invitation will receive the eternal inheritance he has promised to his heirs. For he died to release us from the guilt of the violations committed under the first covenant.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">So this is why not even the first covenant was inaugurated without the blood of animals.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">For Moses ratified the covenant after he gave the people all the commandments of the law. He took the blood of calves and goats, with water, scarlet wool, and a hyssop branch, and sprinkled both the people and the book of the covenant,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">saying, &amp;apos;This is the blood of the covenant that God commands you to keep.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">And later Moses also sprinkled the tabernacle with blood and every utensil and item used in their service of worship.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Actually, nearly everything under the law was purified with blood, since forgiveness only comes through an outpouring of blood.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">And so it was necessary for all the earthly symbols of the heavenly realities to be purified with these animal sacrifices, but the heavenly things themselves required a superior sacrifice than these.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">For the Messiah did not enter into the earthly tabernacle made by men, which was but an echo of the true sanctuary, but he entered into heaven itself to appear before the face of God in our place.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">Under the old system year after year the high priest entered the most holy sanctuary with blood that was not his own. But the Messiah did not need to repeatedly offer himself year after year,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">for that would mean he must suffer repeatedly ever since the fall of the world. But now he has appeared at the fulfillment of the ages to abolish sin once and for all by the sacrifice of himself!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">Every human being is appointed to die once, and then to face God&amp;quot;s judgment.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">But when we die we will be face-to-face with Christ , the One who experienced death once for all to bear the sins of many! And now to those who eagerly await him, he will appear a second time; not to deal with sin, but to bring us the fullness of salvation.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="10">
			<VERS vnumber="1">The old system of living under the law presented us with only a faint shadow, a crude outline of the reality of the wonderful blessings to come. Even with its steady stream of sacrifices offered year after year, there still was nothing that could make our hearts perfect before God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">For what power does the blood of bulls and goats have to remove sin&amp;quot;s guilt?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">So when Jesus the Messiah came into the world he said, &amp;apos;Since your ultimate desire was not another animal sacrifice, that I might offer myself instead! cannot satisfy your justice. I will be the One to go and do your will, &amp;apos;I have the right to take revenge and pay them back for their evil!&amp;apos; And also, my soul is not content with them!&amp;apos; you have clothed me with a body to fulfill all that is written of me in your Word!&amp;quot; &amp;apos; &amp;apos;I will not ever again remember their sins and lawless deeds!&amp;apos; &amp;apos;The Lord God will judge his own people!&amp;apos; &amp;apos;The One who is appearing will come without delay!&amp;apos; &amp;apos;My righteous ones will live from my faith. But if fear holds them back,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Multiple burnt offerings and sin-offerings</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">So I said to you, &amp;quot;God&amp;ndash;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">First he said, &amp;apos;Multiple burnt-offerings and sin-offerings cannot satisfy your justice&amp;apos; (even though the law required them to be offered).</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">And then he said, &amp;apos;God, I will be the One to go and do your will.&amp;apos; So by being the sacrifice that removes sin , he abolishes animal sacrifices and replaces that entire system with the new covenant.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">By God&amp;quot;s will we have been purified and made holy once and for all through the sacrifice of the body of Jesus, the Messiah!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Yet every day priests still serve, ritually offering the same sacrifices again and again&amp;ndash;sacrifices that can never take away sin&amp;quot;s guilt.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">But when this Priest had offered the one supreme sacrifice for sin for all time he sat down on a throne at the right hand of God,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">waiting until all his whispering enemies are subdued and turn into his footstool.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">And by his one perfect sacrifice he made us perfectly holy and complete for all time!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">The Holy Spirit confirms this to us by this Scripture, for the Lord says,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">&amp;apos;Afterwards, I will give them this covenant: I will embed my laws into their hearts and fasten my Word to their thoughts.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">And then he says,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">So if our sins have been forgiven and forgotten, why would we ever need to offer another sacrifice for sin?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">And now we are brothers and sisters in God&amp;quot;s family because of the blood of Jesus, and he welcomes us to come into the most holy sanctuary in the heavenly realm&amp;ndash;boldly and without hesitation.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">For he has dedicated a new, life-giving way for us to approach God. For just as the veil was torn in two, Jesus&amp;quot; body was torn open to give us free and fresh access to him!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">And since we now have a magnificent High Priest to welcome us into God&amp;quot;s house,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">we come closer to God and approach him with an open heart, fully convinced that nothing will keep us at a distance from him. For our hearts have been sprinkled with blood to remove impurity, and we have been freed from an accusing conscience. Now we are clean, unstained, and presentable to God inside and out!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">So now wrap your heart tightly around the hope that lives within us, knowing that God always keeps his promises!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">Discover creative ways to encourage others and to motivate them toward acts of compassion, doing beautiful works as expressions of love.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">This is not the time to pull away and neglect meeting together, as some have formed the habit of doing. In fact, we should come together even more frequently, eager to encourage and urge each other onward as we anticipate that day dawning.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">For if we continue to persist in deliberate sin after we have known and received the truth, there is not another sacrifice for sin to be made for us.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">But this would qualify one for the certain, terrifying expectation of judgment and the raging fire ready to burn up his enemies!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">Anyone who disobeyed Moses&amp;quot; law died without mercy on the simple evidence of two or three witnesses.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">How much more severely do you suppose a person deserves to be judged who has contempt for God&amp;quot;s Son, and who scorns the blood of the new covenant that made him holy, and has outraged the Spirit of grace?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">For we know him who said,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">It is the most terrifying thing of all to come under the judgment of the Living God!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">Don&amp;quot;t you remember those days right after the Light shined in your hearts? You endured a great marathon season of suffering hardships, yet you stood your ground.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">And at times you were publicly and shamefully mistreated, being persecuted for your faith; then at other times you stood side by side with those who preach the message of hope.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">You sympathized with those in prison and when all your belongings were confiscated you accepted that violation with joy; convinced that you possess a treasure growing in heaven that could never be taken from you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">So don&amp;quot;t lose your bold, courageous faith, for you are destined for a great reward!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">You need the strength of endurance to reveal the poetry of God&amp;quot;s will and then you receive the promise in full.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">For soon and very soon,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">And he also says,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">But we are certainly not those who are held back by fear and perish; we are among those who have faith and experience true life!</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="11">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Now faith brings our hopes into reality and becomes the foundation needed to acquire the things we long for. It is all the evidence required to prove what is still unseen.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">This testimony of faith is what previous generations were commended for.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Faith empowers us to see that the universe was created and beautifully coordinated by the power of God&amp;quot;s words! He spoke and the invisible realm gave birth to all that is seen.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Faith moved Abel to choose a more acceptable sacrifice to offer God than his brother Cain, and God declared him righteous because of his offering of faith. By his faith, Abel still speaks instruction to us today, even though he is long dead.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Faith translated Enoch from this life and he was taken up into heaven! He never had to experience death; he just disappeared from this world because God promoted him. For before he was translated to the heavenly realm his life had become a pleasure to God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">And without faith living within us it would be impossible to please God. For we come to God in faith knowing that he is real and that he rewards the faith of those who passionately seek him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Faith opened Noah&amp;quot;s heart to receive revelation and warnings from God about what was coming, even things that had never been seen. But he stepped out in reverent obedience to God and built an ark that would save him and his family. By his faith the world was condemned, but Noah received God&amp;quot;s gift of righteousness that comes by believing.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Faith motivated Abraham to obey God&amp;quot;s call and leave the familiar to discover the territory he was destined to inherit from God. So he left with only a promise and without even knowing ahead of time where he was going, Abraham stepped out in faith.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">He lived by faith as an immigrant in his promised land as though it belonged to someone else. He journeyed through the land living in tents with Isaac and Jacob who were persuaded that they were also co-heirs of the same promise.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">His eyes of faith were set on the city with unshakable foundations, whose architect and builder is God himself.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Sarah&amp;quot;s faith embraced God&amp;quot;s miracle power to conceive even though she was barren and was past the age of childbearing, for the authority of her faith rested in the One who made the promise, and she tapped into his faithfulness.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">In fact, so many children were subsequently fathered by this aged man of faith&amp;ndash;one who was as good as dead, that he now has offspring as innumerable as the sand on the seashore and as the stars in the sky!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">These heroes all died still clinging to their faith, not even receiving all that had been promised them. But they saw beyond the horizon the fulfillment of their promises and gladly embraced it from afar. They all lived their lives on earth as those who belonged to another realm.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">For clearly, those who live this way are longing for the appearing of a heavenly city.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">And if their hearts were still remembering what they left behind, they would have found an opportunity to go back.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">But they couldn&amp;quot;t turn back for their hearts were fixed on what was far greater, that is, the heavenly realm! So because of this God is not ashamed in any way to be called their God, for he has prepared a heavenly city for them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Faith operated powerfully in Abraham for when he was put to the test he offered up Isaac. Even though he received God&amp;quot;s promises of descendants, he was willing to offer up his only son!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">For God had promised, &amp;apos;Through your son Isaac your lineage will carry on your name.&amp;apos; Yet it was faith that enabled others to endure great atrocities. They were stretched out on the wheel and tortured, and didn&amp;quot;t deny their faith in order to be freed, because they longed for a more honorable and glorious resurrection!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Abraham&amp;quot;s faith made it logical to him that God could raise Isaac from the dead, and symbolically, that&amp;quot;s exactly what happened.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">The power of faith prompted Isaac to impart a blessing to his sons, Jacob and Esau, concerning their prophetic destinies.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Jacob worshiped in faith&amp;quot;s reality at the end of his life, and leaning upon his staff he imparted a prophetic blessing upon each of Joseph&amp;quot;s sons.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Faith inspired Joseph and opened his eyes to see into the future, for as he was dying he prophesied about the exodus of Israel out of Egypt, and gave instructions that his bones were to be taken from Egypt with them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">Faith prompted the parents of Moses at his birth to hide him for three months, because they realized their child was exceptional and they refused to be afraid of the king&amp;quot;s edict.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">Faith enabled Moses to choose God&amp;quot;s will, for although he was raised as the son of Pharaoh&amp;quot;s daughter, he refused to make that his identity,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">choosing instead to suffer mistreatment with the people of God. Moses preferred faith&amp;quot;s certainty above the momentary enjoyment of sin&amp;quot;s pleasures.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">He found his true wealth in suffering abuse for being anointed, more than in anything the world could offer him, for his eyes looked with wonder not on the immediate, but on the ultimate&amp;ndash;faith&amp;quot;s great reward!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">Holding faith&amp;quot;s promise Moses abandoned Egypt and had no fear of Pharaoh&amp;quot;s rage because he persisted in faith as if he had seen God who is unseen.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">Faith stirred Moses to perform the rite of Passover and sprinkle lamb&amp;quot;s blood, to prevent the destroyer from harming their firstborn.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">Faith opened the way for the Hebrews to cross the Red Sea as if on dry land, but when the Egyptians tried to cross they were swallowed up and drowned!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">Faith pulled down Jericho&amp;quot;s walls after the people marched around them for seven days!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">Faith provided a way of escape for Rahab the prostitute, avoiding the destruction of the unbelievers, because she received the Hebrew spies in peace.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">And what more could I say to convince you? For there is not enough time to tell you of the faith of Gideon, Barak, Samson, Jephthah, David, Samuel, and the prophets.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">Through faith&amp;quot;s power they conquered kingdoms and established true justice. Their faith fastened onto their promises and pulled them into reality! It was faith that shut the mouth of lions,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">put out the power of raging fire, and caused many to escape certain death by the sword. Although weak, their faith imparted power to make them strong! Faith sparked courage within them and they became mighty warriors in battle, pulling armies from another realm into battle array.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">Faith-filled women saw their dead children raised in resurrection power.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">Others were mocked and experienced the most severe beating with whips; they were in chains and imprisoned.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">Some of these faith champions were brutally killed by stoning, being sawn in two or slaughtered by the sword. These lived in faith as they went about wearing goatskins and sheepskins for clothing. They lost everything they possessed, they endured great afflictions, and they were cruelly mistreated.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">They wandered the earth living in the desert wilderness, in caves, on barren mountains and in holes in the earth. Truly, the world was not even worthy of them, not realizing who they were.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">These were the true heroes, commended for their faith, yet they lived in hope without receiving the fullness of what was promised them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">But now God has invited us to live in something better than what they had&amp;ndash;faith&amp;quot;s fullness! This is so that they could be brought to finished perfection alongside of us.</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="12">
			<VERS vnumber="1">As for us, we have all of these great witnesses who encircle us like clouds. So we must let go of every wound that has pierced us and the sin we so easily fall into. Then we will be able to run life&amp;quot;s marathon race with passion and determination, for the path has been already marked out before us.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">We look away from the natural realm and we focus our attention and expectation onto Jesus who birthed faith within us and who leads us forward into faith&amp;quot;s perfection. His example is this: Because his heart was focused on the joy of knowing that you would be his, he endured the agony of the cross and conquered its humiliation, and now sits exalted at the right hand of the throne of God!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">So consider carefully how Jesus faced such intense opposition from sinners who opposed their own souls, so that you won&amp;quot;t become worn down and cave in under life&amp;quot;s pressures.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">After all, you have not yet reached the point of sweating blood in your opposition to sin.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">And have you forgotten his encouraging words spoken to you as his children? He said, &amp;apos;My child, don&amp;quot;t underestimate the value of the discipline and training of the Lord God, And when he draws you to himself, &amp;apos;If so much as an animal approaches the mountain it is to be stoned to death!&amp;apos; or get depressed when he has to correct you. is the evidence of his faithful love. it proves you are his delightful child.&amp;apos; &amp;apos;Once and for all I will not only shake the systems of the world, but also the unseen powers in the heavenly realm!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">For the Lord&amp;quot;s training of your life</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Fully embrace God&amp;quot;s correction as part of your training, for he is doing what any loving father does for his children. For who has ever heard of a child who never had to be corrected?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">We all should welcome God&amp;quot;s discipline as the validation of authentic sonship. For if we have never once endured his correction it only proves we are strangers and not sons.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">And isn&amp;quot;t it true that we respect our earthly fathers even though they corrected and disciplined us? Then we should demonstrate an even greater respect for God, our spiritual Father, as we submit to his life-giving discipline.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Our parents corrected us for the short time of our childhood as it seemed good to them. But God corrects us throughout our lives for our own good, giving us an invitation to share his holiness.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Now all discipline seems to be painful at the time, yet later it will produce a transformation of character, bringing a harvest of righteousness and peace to those who yield to it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">So be made strong even in your weakness by lifting up your tired hands in prayer and worship . And strengthen your weak knees,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">for as you keep walking forward on God&amp;quot;s paths all your stumbling ways will be divinely healed!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">In every relationship be swift to choose peace over competition, and run swiftly toward holiness, for those who are not holy will not see the Lord.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Watch over each other to make sure that no one misses the revelation of God&amp;quot;s grace. And make sure no one lives with a root of bitterness sprouting within them which will only cause trouble and poison the hearts of many.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Be careful that no one among you lives in immorality, becoming careless about God&amp;quot;s blessings, like Esau who traded away his rights as the firstborn for a simple meal.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">And we know that later on when he wanted to inherit his father&amp;quot;s blessing, he was turned away, even though he begged for it with bitter tears, for it was too late then to repent.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">For we are not coming, as Moses did , to a physical mountain with its burning fire, thick clouds of darkness and gloom, and with a raging whirlwind.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">We are not those who are being warned by the jarring blast of a trumpet and the thundering voice; the fearful voice that they begged to be silenced.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">They couldn&amp;quot;t handle God&amp;quot;s command that said,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">The astounding phenomena Moses witnessed caused him to shudder with fear and he could only say, &amp;apos;I am trembling in terror!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">By contrast, we have already come near to God in a totally different realm, the Zion-realm, for we have entered the city of the Living God, which is the New Jerusalem in heaven! We have joined the festal gathering of myriads of angels in their joyous celebration!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">And as members of the church of the Firstborn all our names have been legally registered as citizens of heaven! And we have come before God who judges all, and who lives among the spirits of the righteous who have been made perfect in his eyes!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">And we have come to Jesus who established a new covenant with his blood sprinkled upon the mercy seat; blood that continues to speak from heaven, &amp;apos;forgiveness,&amp;apos; a better message than Abel&amp;quot;s blood that cries from the earth, &amp;apos;justice.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">Make very sure that you never refuse to listen to God when he speaks! For the God who spoke on earth from Sinai is the same God who now speaks from heaven. Those who heard him speak his living Word on earth found nowhere to hide, so what chance is there for us to escape if we turn our backs on God and refuse to hear his warnings as he speaks from heaven?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">The earth was rocked at the sound of his voice from the mountain, but now he has promised,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">Now this phrase &amp;apos;once and for all&amp;apos; clearly indicates the final removal of things that are shaking, that is, the old order, so only what is unshakable will remain.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">Since we are receiving our rights to an unshakable kingdom we should be extremely thankful and offer God the purest worship that delights his heart as we lay down our lives in absolute surrender, filled with awe.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">For our God is a holy, devouring fire!</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="13">
			<VERS vnumber="1">No matter what, make room in your heart to love every believer.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">And show hospitality to strangers, for they may be angels from God showing up as your guests.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Identify with those who are in prison as though you were there suffering with them, and those who are mistreated as if you could feel their pain.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Honor the sanctity of marriage and keep your vows of purity to one another, for God will judge sexual immorality in any form, whether single or married.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Don&amp;quot;t be obsessed with money but live content with what you have, for you always have God&amp;quot;s presence. For hasn&amp;quot;t he promised you, &amp;apos;I will never leave you, never! And I will not loosen my grip on your life!&amp;apos; and I will never be afraid of what people may do to me!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">So we can say with great confidence: &amp;apos;I know the Lord is for me</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Don&amp;quot;t forget the example of your spiritual leaders who have spoken God&amp;quot;s messages to you, take a close look at how their lives ended, and then follow their walk of faith.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Jesus, the Anointed One, is always the same&amp;ndash;yesterday, today, and forever.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">So don&amp;quot;t let anyone lead you astray with all sorts of novel and exotic teachings. It is more beautiful to feast on grace and be inwardly strengthened than to be obsessed with dietary rules which in themselves have no lasting benefit.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">We feast on a sacrifice at our spiritual altar, but those who serve as priests in the old system of worship have no right to eat of it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">For the high priest carries the blood of animals into the holiest chamber as a sacrifice for sin, and then burns the bodies of the animals outside the city.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">And Jesus, our sin-sacrifice, also suffered death outside the city walls to make us holy by his own blood.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">So we must arise and join him outside the religious &amp;apos;walls&amp;apos; and bear his disgrace.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">For we have no city here on earth to be our permanent home, but we seek the city that is destined to come.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">So we no longer offer up a steady stream of blood sacrifices, but through Jesus, we will offer up to God a steady stream of praise sacrifices&amp;ndash;these are &amp;apos;the lambs&amp;apos; we offer from our lips that celebrate his name!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">We will show mercy to the poor and not miss an opportunity to do acts of kindness for others, for these are the true sacrifices that delight God&amp;quot;s heart.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Obey your spiritual leaders and recognize their authority, for they keep watch over your soul without resting since they will have to give an account to God for their work. So it will benefit you when you make their work a pleasure and not a heavy burden.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">And keep praying for us that we continue to live with a clear conscience, for we desire to live honorably in all that we do.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">And I especially ask you to pray that God would send me back to you very soon.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Now may the God who brought us peace by raising from the dead our Lord Jesus Christ so that he would be the Great Shepherd of his flock; and by the power of the blood of the eternal covenant</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">may he work perfection into every part of you giving you all that you need to fulfill your destiny. And may he express through you all that is excellent and pleasing to him through your life-union with Jesus the Anointed One who is to receive all glory forever! Amen!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">My dear brothers and sisters, I urge you to let your spirits flow through this message of love that I&amp;quot;ve written to you in these few words.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">I want you to know that our brother Timothy is free again and as soon as he arrives here we&amp;quot;ll come together to see you. We extend our greetings to all your leaders and all the holy believers.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1">Greetings! My name is Jacob, and I&amp;quot;m a love-slave of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ. I&amp;quot;m writing to all the twelve tribes of Israel who have been sown as seeds among the nations.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">My fellow believers, when it seems as though you are facing nothing but difficulties, see it as an invaluable opportunity to experience the greatest joy that you can!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">For you know that when your faith is tested it stirs up in you the power of endurance.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">And then as your endurance grows even stronger, it will release perfection into every part of your being until there is nothing missing and nothing lacking.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">And if anyone longs to be wise, ask God for wisdom and he will give it! He won&amp;quot;t see your lack of wisdom as an opportunity to scold you over your failures but he will overwhelm your failures with his generous grace.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Just make sure you ask empowered by confident faith without doubting that you will receive. For the ambivalent person believes one minute and doubts the next. Being undecided makes you become like the rough seas driven and tossed by the wind. You&amp;quot;re up one minute and tossed down the next.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">The believer who is poor still has reasons to boast, for he has been placed on high.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">But those who are rich should boast in how God has brought them low and humbled them, for all their earthly glory will one day fade away like a wildflower in the meadow.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">For as the scorching heat of the sun causes the petals of the wildflower to fall off and lose its appearance of beauty, so the rich in the midst of their pursuit of wealth will wither away.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">If your faith remains strong, even while surrounded by life&amp;quot;s difficulties, you will continue to experience the untold blessings of God! True happiness comes as you pass the test with faith, and receive the victorious crown of life promised to every lover of God!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">When you are tempted don&amp;quot;t ever say, &amp;apos;God is tempting me,&amp;apos; for God is incapable of being tempted by evil and he is never the source of temptation.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Instead it is each person&amp;quot;s own desires and thoughts that drag them into evil and lure them away into darkness.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Evil desires give birth to evil actions. And when sin is fully mature it can murder you!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">So my friends, don&amp;quot;t be fooled by your own desires!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Every gift God freely gives us is good and perfect, streaming down from the Father of lights, who shines from the heavens with no hidden shadow or darkness and is never subject to change.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">God was delighted to give us birth by the truth of his infallible Word so that we would fulfill his chosen destiny for us and become the favorite ones out of all his creation!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">My dearest brothers and sisters, take this to heart: Be quick to listen, but slow to speak. And be slow to become angry,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">for human anger is never a legitimate tool to promote God&amp;quot;s righteous purpose.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">So this is why we abandon everything morally impure and all forms of wicked conduct. Instead, with a sensitive spirit we absorb God&amp;quot;s Word, which has been implanted within our nature, for the Word of Life has power to continually deliver us.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Don&amp;quot;t just listen to the Word of Truth and not respond to it, for that is the essence of self-deception. So always let his Word become like poetry written and fulfilled by your life!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">If you listen to the Word and don&amp;quot;t live out the message you hear, you become like the person who looks in the mirror of the Word to discover the reflection of his face in the beginning.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">You perceive how God sees you in the mirror of the Word , but then you go out and forget your divine origin.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">But those who set their gaze deeply into the perfecting law of liberty are fascinated by and respond to the truth they hear and are strengthened by it&amp;ndash;they experience God&amp;quot;s blessing in all that they do!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">If someone believes they have a relationship with God but fails to guard his words then his heart is drifting away and his religion is shallow and empty.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">True spirituality that is pure in the eyes of our Father God is to make a difference in the lives of the orphans, and widows in their troubles, and to refuse to be corrupted by the world&amp;quot;s values.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="2">
			<VERS vnumber="1">My dear brothers and sisters, fellow believers in our glorious Lord Jesus Christ&amp;ndash;how could we say that we have faith in him and yet we favor one group of people above another?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Suppose an influential man comes into your worship meeting wearing gold rings and expensive clothing, and also a homeless man in shabby clothes comes in.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">If you show special attention to the rich man in expensive clothes and say, &amp;apos;Here&amp;quot;s a seat of honor for you right up front!&amp;apos; but you turn and say to the poor beggar dressed in rags, &amp;apos;You can stand over here,&amp;apos; or &amp;apos;Sit over there on the floor in the back,&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">then you&amp;quot;ve demonstrated gross prejudice among yourselves and used evil standards of judgment!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">So listen carefully, my dear brothers and sisters, hasn&amp;quot;t God chosen the poor in the world&amp;quot;s eyes to be those who are rich in faith? And won&amp;quot;t they be the heirs of the kingdom-realm he promised to those who love him?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">But yet you insult and shun the poor in your efforts to impress the rich ! Isn&amp;quot;t it the wealthy who exploit you and drag you into court?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Aren&amp;quot;t they the very ones who blaspheme the beautiful name of the One you now belong to?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Your calling is to fulfill the royal law of love as given to us in this Scripture: &amp;apos;You must love and value your neighbor as you love and value yourself!&amp;apos; For keeping this law is the noble way to live.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">But when you show prejudice you commit sin and you violate this royal law of love!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">For the one who attempts to keep all of the law of Moses but fails in just one point has become guilty of breaking the law in every respect!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">For the same One who tells us, &amp;apos;Do not commit adultery,&amp;apos; also said, &amp;apos;Do not murder.&amp;apos; Now if you don&amp;quot;t commit adultery but do commit murder, you are still guilty as a law-breaker.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">So we must both speak and act in every respect like those who are destined to be tried by the perfect law of liberty,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">and remember that judgment is merciless for the one who judges others without mercy. So by showing mercy, you take dominion over judgment!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">My dear brothers and sisters, what good is it if someone claims to have faith but demonstrates no good works to prove it? How could this kind of faith save anyone?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">For example, if a brother or sister in the faith is poorly clothed and hungry</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">and you leave them saying, &amp;apos;Good-bye. I hope you stay warm and have plenty to eat,&amp;apos; but you don&amp;quot;t provide them with a coat or even a cup of soup, what good is your faith?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">So then faith that doesn&amp;quot;t involve action is phony.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">But someone might object and say, &amp;apos;One person has faith and another person has works.&amp;apos; Go ahead then and prove to me that you have faith without works and I will show you faith by my works as proof that I believe.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">You can believe all you want that there is one true God, that&amp;quot;s wonderful! But even the demons know this and tremble with fear before him, yet they&amp;quot;re unchanged&amp;ndash; they remain demons .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">O feeble sons of Adam, do you need further evidence that faith divorced from good works is phony?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Wasn&amp;quot;t our ancestor Abraham found righteous before God because of his works when he offered his son Isaac on the altar?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Can&amp;quot;t you see how his action cooperated with his faith and by his action faith found its full expression?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">So in this way the Scripture was fulfilled: Because Abraham believed God, his faith was exchanged for God&amp;quot;s righteousness. So he became known as the lover of God!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">So now it&amp;quot;s clear that a person is seen as righteous in God&amp;quot;s eyes not merely by faith alone, but by his works.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">And the same is true of the prostitute named Rahab who was found righteous in God&amp;quot;s eyes by her works, for she received the spies into her home and helped them escape from the city by another route.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">For just as a human body without the spirit is a dead corpse, so faith without the expression of good works is dead!</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="3">
			<VERS vnumber="1">My dear brothers and sisters, don&amp;quot;t be so eager to become a teacher in the church since you know that we who teach are held to a higher standard of judgment.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">We all fail in many areas, but especially with our words. Yet if we&amp;quot;re able to bridle the words we say we are powerful enough to control ourselves in every way, and that means our character is mature and fully developed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Horses have bits and bridles in their mouths so that we can control and guide their large body.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">And the same with mighty ships, though they are massive and driven by fierce winds, yet they are steered by a tiny rudder at the direction of the person at the helm.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">And so the tongue is a small part of the body yet it carries great power! Just think of how a small flame can set a huge forest ablaze.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">And the tongue is a fire! It can be compared to the sum total of wickedness and is the most dangerous part of our human body. It corrupts the entire body and is a hellish flame! It releases a fire that can burn throughout the course of human existence.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">For every wild animal on earth including birds, creeping reptiles, and creatures of the sea and land have all been overpowered and tamed by humans,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">but the tongue is not able to be tamed. It&amp;quot;s a fickle, unrestrained evil that spews out words full of toxic poison!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">We use our tongue to praise God our Father and then turn around and curse a person who was made in his very image!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Out of the same mouth we pour out words of praise one minute and curses the next. My brothers and sisters, this should never be!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">If you consider yourself to be wise and one who understands the ways of God, advertise it with a beautiful, fruitful life guided by wisdom&amp;quot;s gentleness. Never brag or boast about what you&amp;quot;ve done and you&amp;quot;ll prove that you&amp;quot;re truly wise.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">But if there is bitter jealousy or competition hiding in your heart, then don&amp;quot;t deny it and try to compensate for it by boasting and being phony.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">For that has nothing to do with God&amp;quot;s heavenly wisdom but can best be described as the wisdom of this world, both selfish and devilish.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">So wherever jealousy and selfishness are uncovered, you will also find many troubles and every kind of meanness.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">But the wisdom from above is always pure, filled with peace, considerate and teachable. It is filled with love and never displays prejudice or hypocrisy in any form</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">and it always bears the beautiful harvest of righteousness! Good seeds of wisdom&amp;quot;s fruit will be planted with peaceful acts by those who cherish making peace.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="4">
			<VERS vnumber="1">What is the cause of your conflicts and quarrels with each other? Doesn&amp;quot;t the battle begin inside of you as you fight to have your own way and fulfill your own desires?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">You jealously want what others have so you begin to see yourself as better than others. You scheme with envy and harm others to selfishly obtain what you crave&amp;ndash;that&amp;quot;s why you quarrel and fight. And all the time you don&amp;quot;t obtain what you want because you won&amp;quot;t ask God for it!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">And if you ask, you won&amp;quot;t receive it for you&amp;quot;re asking with corrupt motives, seeking only to fulfill your own selfish desires.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">You have become spiritual adulterers who are having an affair, an unholy relationship with the world. Don&amp;quot;t you know that flirting with the world&amp;quot;s values places you at odds with God? Whoever chooses to be the world&amp;quot;s friend makes himself God&amp;quot;s enemy!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Does the Scripture mean nothing to you that says, &amp;apos;The Spirit that God breathed into our hearts is a jealous Lover who intensely desires to have more and more of us&amp;apos;?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">But he continues to pour out more and more grace upon us. For it says, &amp;apos;God resists you when you are proud but continually pours out grace when you are humble.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">So then, surrender to God. Stand up to the devil and resist him and he will flee in agony.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Move your heart closer and closer to God, and he will come even closer to you. But make sure you cleanse your life, you sinners, and keep your heart pure and stop doubting.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Feel the pain of your sin, be sorrowful and weep! Let your joking around be turned into mourning and your joy into deep humiliation.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Be willing to be made low before the Lord and he will exalt you!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Dear friends, as part of God&amp;quot;s family, never speak against another family member, for when you slander a brother or sister you violate God&amp;quot;s law of love . And your duty is not to make yourself a judge of the law of love by saying that it doesn&amp;quot;t apply to you, but your duty is to obey it !</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">There is only one true Lawgiver and Judge, the One who has the power to save and destroy&amp;ndash;so who do you think you are to judge your neighbor?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Listen, those of you who are boasting, &amp;apos;Today or tomorrow we&amp;quot;ll go to another city and spend some time and go into business and make heaps of profit!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">But you don&amp;quot;t have a clue what tomorrow may bring. For your fleeting life is but a warm breath of air that is visible in the cold only for a moment and then vanishes!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Instead you should say, &amp;apos;Our tomorrows are in the Lord&amp;quot;s hands and if he is willing we will live life to its fullest and do this or that.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">But here you are, boasting in your ignorance, for to be presumptuous about what you&amp;quot;ll do tomorrow is evil!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">So if you know of an opportunity to do the right thing today, yet you refrain from doing it, you&amp;quot;re guilty of sin.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="5">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Listen all you who are rich, for it&amp;quot;s time to weep and howl over the misery that will overtake you!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Your riches lie rotting, your fine clothing eaten by moths,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">and your gold and silver are corroded as a witness against you. You have hoarded up treasure for the last days but it will become a fire to burn your flesh.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Listen! Can&amp;quot;t you hear the cries of the laborers over the wages you fraudulently held back from those who worked for you? The cries for justice of those you&amp;quot;ve cheated have reached the ears of the Lord of armies!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">You have indulged yourselves with every luxury and pleasure this world offers, but you&amp;quot;re only stuffing your heart full for a day of slaughter.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">You have condemned and murdered good and innocent people who had no power to defend themselves.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Meanwhile, brothers and sisters, we must be patient and filled with expectation as we wait for the appearing of the Lord. Think about the farmer who has to patiently wait for the earth&amp;quot;s harvest as it ripens because of the early and latter rains.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">So you also, keep your hopes high and be patient, for the presence of the Lord is drawing closer.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Since each of you are part of God&amp;quot;s family never complain or grumble about each other so that judgment will not come on you, for the true Judge is near and very ready to appear!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">My brothers and sisters, take the prophets as your mentors. They have prophesied in the name of the Lord and it brought them great sufferings , yet they patiently endured.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">We honor them as our heroes because they remained faithful even while enduring great sufferings. And you have heard of all that Job went through and we can now see that the Lord ultimately treated him with wonderful kindness, revealing how tenderhearted he really is!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Above all we must be those who never need to verify our speech as truthful by swearing by the heavens or the earth or any other oath. But instead we must be so full of integrity that our &amp;apos;Yes&amp;apos; or &amp;apos;No&amp;apos; is convincing enough and we do not stumble into hypocrisy.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Are there any believers in your fellowship suffering great hardship and distress? Encourage them to pray! Are there happy, cheerful ones among you? Encourage them to sing out their praises!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Are there any sick among you? Then ask the elders of the church to come and pray over the sick and anoint them with oil in the name of our Lord.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">And the prayer of faith will heal the sick and the Lord will raise them up, and if they have committed sins they will be forgiven.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Confess and acknowledge how you have offended one another and then pray for one another to be instantly healed, for tremendous power is released through the passionate, heartfelt prayer of a godly believer!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Elijah was a man with human frailties, just like all of us, but he prayed and received supernatural answers. He actually shut the heavens over the land so there would be no rain for three and a half years!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Then he prayed again and the skies opened up over the land so that the rain came again and produced the harvest.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Finally, as members of God&amp;quot;s beloved family, we must go after the one who wanders from the truth and bring him back.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">For the one who restores the sinning believer back to God from the error of his way, gives back to his soul life from the dead, and covers over countless sins by their demonstration of love!</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1">From Peter, an apostle of Jesus the Anointed One, to the chosen ones who have been scattered like &amp;apos;seed&amp;apos; into the nations living as refugees in Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, and throughout the Roman provinces of Asia and Bithynia.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">You are not forgotten , for you have been chosen and destined by Father God. The Holy Spirit has set you apart to be God&amp;quot;s holy ones, obedient followers of Jesus Christ who have been gloriously sprinkled with his blood. May God&amp;quot;s delightful grace and peace cascade over you many times over!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Celebrate with praises the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has shown us his extravagant mercy. For his fountain of mercy has given us a new life&amp;ndash;we are reborn to experience a living, energetic hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">We are reborn into a perfect inheritance that can never perish, never be defiled, and never diminish. It is promised and preserved forever in the heavenly realm for you!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Through our faith, the mighty power of God constantly guards us until our full salvation is ready to be revealed in the last time.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">May the thought of this cause you to jump for joy, even though lately you&amp;quot;ve had to put up with the grief of many trials.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">But these only reveal the sterling core of your faith, which is far more valuable than gold that perishes, for even gold is refined by fire. Your authentic faith will result in even more praise, glory, and honor when Jesus the Anointed One is revealed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">You love him passionately although you have not seen him, but through believing in him you are saturated with an ecstatic joy, indescribably sublime and immersed in glory.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">For you are reaping the harvest of your faith&amp;ndash;the full salvation promised you&amp;ndash;your souls&amp;quot; victory!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">This salvation was the focus of the prophets who prophesied of this outpouring of grace that was destined for you. They made a careful search and investigation of the meaning of their God-given prophecies</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">as they probed into the mysteries of who would fulfill them and the time period when it would all take place. The Spirit of the Anointed One was in them and was pointing prophetically to the sufferings that Christ was destined to suffer and the glories that would be released afterward.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">God revealed to the prophets that their ministry was not for their own benefit but for yours. And now, you have heard these things from the evangelists who preached the gospel to you through the power of the Holy Spirit sent from heaven&amp;ndash;the gospel containing wonderful mysteries that even the angels long to get a glimpse of.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">So then, prepare your hearts and minds for action! Stay alert and fix your hope firmly on the marvelous grace that is coming to you. For when Jesus Christ is unveiled, a greater measure of grace will be released to you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">As God&amp;quot;s obedient children, never again shape your lives by the desires that you followed when you didn&amp;quot;t know better.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Instead, shape your lives to become like the Holy One who called you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">For Scripture says: &amp;apos;You are to be holy, because I am holy.&amp;apos; like blossoms of the field. And this is the Word that was announced to you!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Since you call on him as your heavenly Father, the impartial Judge who judges according to each one&amp;quot;s works, live each day with holy awe and reverence throughout your time on earth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">For you know that your lives were ransomed once and for all from the empty and futile way of life handed down from generation to generation. It was not a ransom payment of silver and gold, which eventually perishes,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">but the precious blood of Christ&amp;ndash;who like a spotless, unblemished lamb was sacrificed for us .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">This was part of God&amp;quot;s plan , for he was chosen and destined for this before the foundation of the earth was laid, but he has been made manifest in these last days for you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">It is through him that you now believe in God, who raised him from the dead and glorified him, so that you would fasten your faith and hope in God alone .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Now, because of your obedience to the truth, you have purified your very souls, and this empowers you to be full of love for your fellow believers. So express this sincere love toward one another passionately and with a pure heart.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">For through the eternal and living Word of God you have been born again. And this &amp;apos;seed&amp;apos; that he planted within you can never be destroyed but will live and grow inside of you forever. For:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">Human beings are frail and temporary , like grass, and the glory of man fleeting The grass dries and withers and the flowers fall off,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">but the Word of the Lord endures forever!</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="2">
			<VERS vnumber="1">So abandon every form of evil, deceit, hypocrisy, feelings of jealousy and slander.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">In the same way that nursing infants cry for milk, you must intensely crave the pure spiritual milk of God&amp;quot;s Word . For this &amp;apos;milk&amp;apos; will cause you to grow into maturity, fully nourished and strong for life &amp;ndash;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">especially now that you have had a taste of the goodness of Yahweh and have experienced his kindness.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">So keep coming to him who is the Living Stone &amp;ndash;though he was rejected and discarded by men but chosen by God and is priceless in God&amp;quot;s sight.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Come and be his &amp;apos;living stones&amp;apos; who are continually being assembled into a sanctuary for God. For now you serve as holy priests, offering up spiritual sacrifices that he readily accepts through Jesus Christ.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">For it says in Scripture: Look! I lay a cornerstone in Zion, will certainly not be disappointed. has now become the cornerstone and a rock to trip over. and he never spoke deceitfully. a chosen and priceless stone! And whoever believes in him The stone that the builders rejected and discarded A stone that makes them stumble They keep stumbling over the message because they refuse to believe it. And this they were destined to do.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">As believers you know his great worth&amp;ndash;indeed, his preciousness is imparted to you. But for those who do not believe:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">And</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">But you are God&amp;quot;s chosen treasure &amp;ndash;priests who are kings, a spiritual &amp;apos;nation&amp;apos; set apart as God&amp;quot;s devoted ones. He called you out of darkness to experience his marvelous light, and now he claims you as his very own. He did this so that you would broadcast his glorious wonders throughout the world .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">For at one time you were not God&amp;quot;s people, but now you are. At one time you knew nothing of God&amp;quot;s mercy, because you hadn&amp;quot;t received it yet, but now you are drenched with it!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">My divinely loved friends, since you are resident aliens and foreigners in this world, I appeal to you to divorce yourselves from the evil desires that wage war within you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Live honorable lives as you mix with unbelievers, even though they accuse you of being evildoers. For they will see your beautiful works and have a reason to glorify God in the day he visits us.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">In order to honor the Lord, you must respect and defer to the authority of every human institution, whether it be the highest ruler</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">or the governors he puts in place to punish lawbreakers and to praise those who do what&amp;quot;s right.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">For it is God&amp;quot;s will for you to silence the ignorance of foolish people by doing what is right.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">As God&amp;quot;s loving servants, you should live in complete freedom, but never use your freedom as a cover-up for evil.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Recognize the value of every person and continually show love to every believer. Live your lives with great reverence and in holy awe of God. Honor your rulers.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Those who are servants, submit to the authority of those who are your masters&amp;ndash;not only to those who are kind and gentle but even to those who are hard and difficult.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">You find God&amp;quot;s favor by deciding to please God even when you endure hardships because of unjust suffering.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">For what merit is it to endure mistreatment for wrongdoing? Yet if you are mistreated when you do what is right, and you faithfully endure it, this is commendable before God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">In fact, you were called to live this way, because Christ also suffered in your place, leaving you his example for you to follow.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">He never sinned</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">When he was verbally abused, he did not return with an insult; when he suffered, he would not threaten retaliation. Jesus faithfully entrusted himself into the hands of God, who judges righteously.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">He himself carried our sins in his body on the cross so that we would be dead to sin and live for righteousness. Our instant healing flowed from his wounding.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">You were like sheep that continually wandered away, but now you have returned to the true Shepherd of your lives&amp;ndash;the kind Guardian who lovingly watches over your souls.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="3">
			<VERS vnumber="1">And now let me speak to the wives. Be devoted to your own husbands, so that even if some of them do not obey the Word of God, your kind conduct may win them over without you saying a thing.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">For when they observe your pure, godly life before God, it will impact them deeply .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Holy women of long ago who had set their hopes in God beautified themselves with lives lived in deference to their own husbands&amp;quot; authority.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">For example, our &amp;apos;mother,&amp;apos; Sarah, devoted herself to her husband, Abraham, and even called him &amp;apos;master.&amp;apos; And you have become her daughters when you do what is right without fear and intimidation.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Husbands, you in turn must treat your wives with tenderness, viewing them as feminine partners who deserve to be honored, for they are co-heirs with you of the &amp;apos; divine grace of life,&amp;apos; so that nothing will hinder your prayers.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Now, this is the goal: to live in harmony with one another and demonstrate affectionate love, sympathy, and kindness toward other believers. Let humility describe who you are as you dearly love one another.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Never retaliate when someone treats you wrongly, nor insult those who insult you, but instead, respond by speaking a blessing over them&amp;ndash;because a blessing is what God promised to give you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">For the Scriptures tell us: Whoever wants to embrace true life and find beauty in each day and never deceive in what they say. Always turn from what is wrong and cultivate what is good; eagerly pursue peace in every relationship, making it your prize. and his heart responds to their prayers. Don&amp;quot;t be intimidated or terrified</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">must stop speaking evil, hurtful words</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">For the eyes of the Lord Yahweh rest upon the godly, But he turns his back on those who practice evil. by those who would terrify you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Why would anyone harm you if you&amp;quot;re passionate and devoted to pleasing God?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">But even if you happen to suffer for doing what is right, you will have the joyful experience of the blessing of God. And</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">But give reverent honor in your hearts to the Anointed One and treat him as the holy Master of your lives . And if anyone asks about the hope living within you, always be ready to explain your faith</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">with gentleness and respect. Maintain a clean conscience, so that those who slander you for living a pure life in Christ will have to lie about you and will be ashamed because of their slander.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">For it is better to suffer for doing good, if it is in God&amp;quot;s plan, than for doing evil.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Christ suffered and died for sins once and for all&amp;ndash;the innocent for the guilty &amp;ndash;to bring you near to God by his body being put to death and by being raised to life by the Spirit.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">He went in the spiritual realm and made a proclamation to the spirits in prison</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">because of their disobedience of long ago. For during the time of Noah God patiently waited while the ark was being prepared, but only a few were brought safely through the floodwaters: a total of eight souls.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">This was a prophetic picture of the immersion that now saves you&amp;ndash;not a bathing of the physical body but rather the response of a good conscience before God through the resurrection of Jesus Christ,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">who is now in heaven at the place of supreme authority next to God. The very powers of heaven, including every angel and authority, now yield in submission to him.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="4">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Since Christ, though innocent , suffered in his flesh for you, now you also must be a prepared soldier, having the same mind-set, for whoever has died in his body is done with sin.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">So live the rest of your earthly life no longer concerned with human desires but consumed with what brings pleasure to God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">For you have already spent enough time doing what unbelievers love to do&amp;ndash;living in debauchery, sensuality, partying, drunkenness, wild drinking parties, and the worship of demons.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">They marvel that you no longer rush to join them in the excesses of their corrupt lifestyles, and so they vilify you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">But one day they will have to give an account to the one who is destined to judge the living and the dead.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">This is the reason the gospel was preached to the martyrs before they gave their lives . Even though they were judged by human standards, now they live in spirit by God&amp;quot;s standards.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Since we are approaching the end of all things, be intentional, purposeful, and self-controlled so that you can be given to prayer.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Above all, constantly echo God&amp;quot;s intense love for one another, for love will be a canopy over a multitude of sins.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Be compassionate to foreigners without complaining.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Every believer has received grace gifts, so use them to serve one another as faithful stewards of the many-colored tapestry of God&amp;quot;s grace.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">For example , if you have a speaking gift , speak as though God were speaking his words through you. If you have the gift of serving, do it passionately with the strength God gives you, so that in everything God alone will be glorified through Jesus Christ. For to him belong the power and the glory forever throughout all ages! Amen.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Beloved friends, if life gets extremely difficult, with many tests, don&amp;quot;t be bewildered as though something strange were overwhelming you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Instead, continue to rejoice, for you, in a measure, have shared in the sufferings of the Anointed One so that you can share in the revelation of his glory and celebrate with even greater gladness!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">If you are insulted because of the name of Christ, you are greatly blessed, because the Spirit of glory and power, who is the Spirit of God, rests upon you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Let none of you merit suffering as a murderer, or thief, or criminal, or as one who meddles in the affairs of others.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">If you suffer for being a Christian, don&amp;quot;t consider it a disgrace but a privilege . Glorify God because you carry the Anointed One&amp;quot;s name.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">For the time is ripe for judgment to begin in God&amp;quot;s own household. And if it starts with us, what will be the fate of those who refuse to obey the gospel of God?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">And: If the righteous are barely saved, what will become of the wicked and godless?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">So then, those who suffer for following God&amp;quot;s will should enfold their lives into the Creator, who will never fail them, and continue to always do what is right.</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="5">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Now, I encourage you as an elder, an eyewitness of the sufferings of Christ, and one who shares in the glory that is about to be unveiled. I urge my fellow elders among you</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">to be compassionate shepherds who tenderly care for God&amp;quot;s flock and who feed them well, for you have the responsibility to guide, protect, and oversee. Consider it a joyous pleasure and not merely a religious duty. Lead from the heart under God&amp;quot;s leadership&amp;ndash;not as a way to gain finances dishonestly but as a way to eagerly and cheerfully serve .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Don&amp;quot;t be controlling tyrants but lead others by your beautiful examples to the flock.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">And when the Shepherd-King appears, you will win the victor&amp;quot;s crown of glory that never fades away.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">In the same way, the younger ones should willingly support the leadership of the elders. In every relationship, each of you must wrap around yourself the apron of a humble servant. Because: God resists you when you are proud Peace to all who are in life union with Christ. Amen. but multiplies grace and favor when you are humble.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">If you bow low in God&amp;quot;s awesome presence, he will eventually exalt you as you leave the timing in his hands.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Pour out all your worries and stress upon him and leave them there , for he always tenderly cares for you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Be well balanced and always alert, because your enemy, the devil, roams around incessantly, like a roaring lion looking for its prey to devour.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Take a decisive stand against him and resist his every attack with strong, vigorous faith. For you know that your believing brothers and sisters around the world are experiencing the same kinds of troubles you endure.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">And then, after your brief suffering, the God of all loving grace, who has called you to share in his eternal glory in Christ, will personally and powerfully restore you and make you stronger than ever. Yes, he will set you firmly in place and build you up.</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="1">
			<VERS vnumber="1">This letter is from Simeon Peter, a loving servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ. I am writing to those who have been given a faith as equally precious as ours through the righteousness of our God and Savior, Jesus Christ.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">May grace and perfect peace cascade over you as you live in the rich knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Everything we could ever need for life and godliness has already been deposited in us by his divine power. For all this was lavished upon us through the rich experience of knowing him who has called us by name and invited us to come to him through a glorious manifestation of his goodness.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">As a result of this, he has given you magnificent promises that are beyond all price, so that through the power of these tremendous promises we can experience partnership with the divine nature, by which you have escaped the corrupt desires that are of the world.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">So devote yourselves to lavishly supplementing your faith with goodness, and to goodness add understanding, and to self-control add patient endurance,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">and to understanding add the strength of self-control, and to patient endurance add godliness, and to mercy toward others add unending love.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">and to godliness add mercy toward your brothers and sisters,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Since these virtues are already planted deep within, and you possess them in abundant supply, they will keep you from being inactive or fruitless in your pursuit of knowing Jesus Christ more intimately.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">But if anyone lacks these things, he is blind, constantly closing his eyes to the mysteries of our faith, and forgetting his innocence &amp;ndash;for his past sins have been washed away.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">For this reason, beloved ones, be eager to confirm and validate that God has invited you to salvation and claimed you as his own. If you do these things, you will never stumble.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">As a result, the kingdom&amp;quot;s gates will open wide to you as God choreographs your triumphant entrance into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior, Jesus the Messiah.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">I won&amp;quot;t hesitate to continually remind you of these truths, even though you are aware of them and are well established in the present measure of truth you have already embraced.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">And as long as I live I will continue to awaken you with this reminder,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">since our Lord Jesus, the Anointed One, has clearly revealed that my departure is near.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Indeed, I&amp;quot;m passionate to share these things with you so that you will always remember them after my exodus from this life.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">We were not retelling some masterfully crafted legend when we informed you of the power and appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ, for we saw his magnificence and splendor unveiled before our very eyes.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Yes, Father God lavished upon him radiant glory and honor when his distinct voice spoke out of the realm of majestic glory, endorsing him with these words: This is my cherished Son, marked by my love. All my delight is found in him!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">And we ourselves heard that voice resound from the heavens while we were with him on the holy mountain.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">And so we have been given the prophetic word&amp;ndash;the written message of the prophets, made more reliable and fully validated by the confirming voice of God on the Mount of Transfiguration . And you will continue to do well if you stay focused on it. For this prophetic message is like a piercing light shining in a gloomy place until the dawning of a new day, when the Morning Star rises in your hearts.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">You must understand this at the outset: Interpretation of scriptural prophecy requires the Holy Spirit , for it does not originate from someone&amp;quot;s own imagination.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">No true prophecy comes from human initiative but is inspired by the moving of the Holy Spirit upon those who spoke the message that came from God.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="2">
			<VERS vnumber="1">In the past there arose false prophets among God&amp;quot;s people, just as there will continue to be false teachers who will secretly infiltrate in your midst to divide you , bringing with them their destructive heresies. They will even deny the Master, who paid the price for them, bringing swift destruction on themselves.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Many will follow immoral lifestyles. Because of these corrupt false teachers , the way of truth will be slandered.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">They are only out for themselves, ready to exploit you for their own gain through their cunning arguments. Their condemnation has been a long time coming. But their destruction does not slumber or sit idly by, for it is sure to come .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Now, don&amp;quot;t forget , God had no pity for the angels when they sinned but threw them into the lowest, darkest dungeon of gloom and locked them in chains, where they are firmly held until the judgment of torment.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">And he did not spare the former world in the days of Noah when he sent a flood to destroy a depraved world (although he protected Noah, the preacher of righteousness, along with seven members of his family).</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">And don&amp;quot;t forget that he reduced to ashes the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah, condemning them to ruin and destruction. God appointed them to be examples as to what is coming to the ungodly.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Yet he rescued a righteous man, Lot, suffering the indignity of the unbridled lusts of the lawless.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">For righteous Lot lived among them day after day, distressed in his righteous soul by the rebellious deeds he saw and heard.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">If the Lord Yahweh rescued Lot , he knows how to continually rescue the godly from their trials and to reserve the ungodly for punishment on the day of judgment.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">And this especially applies to those who live their lives despising authorities and who abandon themselves to chasing the depraved lusts of their flesh. They are willfully arrogant and insolent, unafraid to insult the glorious ones. A dog will return to his own vomit</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Yet even angels, who are greater than they in power and strength, do not dare slander them before the Lord.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">These individuals are nothing but brute beasts&amp;ndash;irrational creatures, born in the wild to be caught and destroyed&amp;ndash;and they will perish like beasts. They are professional insulters, who slander whatever they don&amp;quot;t understand, and in their destruction they will be destroyed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">For all the evil they have done will come crashing down on them. They consider it their great pleasure to carouse in broad daylight. When they come to your love feasts they are but stains and blemishes, reveling in their deceptions as they feast with you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">They are addicted to adultery, with eyes that are insatiable, with sins that never end. They seduce the vulnerable and are experts in their greed&amp;ndash;they are but children of a curse!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">They have wandered off the main road and have gone astray, because they are prophets who love profit&amp;ndash;the wages they earn by wrongdoing. They are following the example of Balaam, son of Beor,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">who was rebuked for evil by a donkey incapable of speech yet that spoke with a human voice and restrained the prophet&amp;quot;s madness.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">These people are dried-up riverbeds, waterless clouds pushed along by stormy winds&amp;ndash;the deepest darkness of gloom has been prepared for them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">They spout off with their grandiose, impressive nonsense. Consumed with the lusts of the flesh, they lure back into sin those who recently escaped from their error.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">They promise others freedom, yet they themselves are slaves to corruption, for people are slaves to whatever overcomes them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Those who escape the corrupting forces of this world system through the experience of knowing about our Lord and Savior, Jesus the Messiah, then go back into entanglement with them and are defeated by them, becoming worse off than they were to start with.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">It would have been much better for them never to have experienced the way of righteousness than to know it and then turn away from the sacred obligation that was given to them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">They become illustrations of the true proverb: and a washed pig to its rolling in the mud.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="3">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Beloved friends, this is now the second letter I have written to you in which I&amp;quot;ve attempted to stir you up and awaken you to a proper mind-set.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">So never forget both the prophecies spoken by the holy prophets of old and the teaching of our Lord and Savior spoken by your apostles.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Above all, you must understand that in the last days mockers will multiply, chasing after their evil desires.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">They will say, &amp;apos;So what about this promise of his coming? Our ancestors are dead and buried, yet everything is still the same as it was since from the beginning of time until now.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">But they conveniently overlook that from the beginning, the heavens and earth were created by God&amp;quot;s word. He spoke and the dry ground separated from the waters.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Then long afterward he destroyed the world with a tremendous flood by those very waters.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">And now, by the same powerful word, the heavens and the earth are reserved for fire, being kept for judgment day, when all the ungodly will perish.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">So, dear friends, don&amp;quot;t let this one thing escape your notice: a single day counts like a thousand years to the Lord Yahweh , and a thousand years counts as one day.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">This means that, contrary to man&amp;quot;s perspective , the Lord is not late with his promise to return , as some measure lateness. But rather, his &amp;apos;delay&amp;apos; simply reveals his loving patience toward you, because he does not want any to perish but all to come to repentance.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">The day of the Lord will come and take everyone by surprise&amp;ndash;as unexpected as a home invasion. The atmosphere will be set on fire and vanish with a horrific roar, and the heavenly bodies will melt away as in a tremendous blaze. The earth and every activity of man will be laid bare.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Since all these things are on the verge of being dismantled, don&amp;quot;t you see how vital it is to live a holy life? We must be consumed with godliness</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="14">So, my beloved friends, with all that you have to look forward to, may you be eager to be found living pure lives when you come into his presence , without blemish and filled with peace.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">And keep in mind that our Lord&amp;quot;s extraordinary patience simply means more opportunity for salvation, just as our dear brother Paul wrote to you with the wisdom that God gave him.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1">We saw him with our very own eyes. We gazed upon him and heard him speak. Our hands actually touched him, the Living Expression of God. For truly our fellowship is with the Father and with his Son, Jesus, the Anointed One. the one who was from the beginning, and we have seen him. We testify to this truth: the eternal Life-Giver lived face-to-face with the Father and has now dawned upon us. what we have seen and heard about this Life-Giver so that we may share and enjoy this life together.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">This Life-Giver was made visible</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">So we proclaim to you</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">We are writing these things to you because we want to release to you our fullness of joy.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">This is the life-giving message we heard him share and it&amp;quot;s still ringing in our ears . We now repeat his words to you: God is pure light. You will never find even a trace of darkness in him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">If we claim that we share life with him, but keep walking in the realm of darkness, we&amp;quot;re fooling ourselves and not living the truth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">But if we keep living in the pure light that surrounds him, we share unbroken fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus, his Son, continually cleanses us from all sin.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">If we boast that we have no sin, we&amp;quot;re only fooling ourselves and are strangers to the truth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">But if we freely admit our sins when his light uncovers them , he will be faithful to forgive us every time. God is just to forgive us our sins because of Christ , and he will continue to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">If we claim that we&amp;quot;re not guilty of sin when God uncovers it with his light , we make him a liar and his word is not in us.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="2">
			<VERS vnumber="1">You are my dear children, and I write these things to you so that you won&amp;quot;t sin. But if anyone does sin, we continually have a forgiving Redeemer who is face-to-face with the Father: Jesus Christ, the Righteous One.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">He is the atoning sacrifice for our sins, and not only for ours but also for the sins of the whole world.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Here&amp;quot;s how we can be sure that we&amp;quot;ve truly come to know God: if we keep his commands.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">If someone claims, &amp;apos;I have come to know God by experience ,&amp;apos; yet doesn&amp;quot;t keep God&amp;quot;s commands, he is a phony and the truth finds no place in him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">But the love of God will be perfected within the one who obeys God&amp;quot;s Word. We can be sure that we&amp;quot;ve truly come to live in intimacy with God,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">not just by saying, &amp;apos;I am intimate with God,&amp;apos; but by walking in the footsteps of Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Beloved, I&amp;quot;m not writing a new commandment to you, but an old one that you had from the beginning, and you&amp;quot;ve already heard it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Yet, in a sense, it is a new commandment, as its truth is made manifest both in Christ and in you, because the darkness is disappearing and the true light is already blazing.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Anyone who says, &amp;apos;I am in the light,&amp;apos; while holding hatred in his heart toward a fellow believer is still in the darkness.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">But the one who truly loves a fellow believer lives in the light, and there is nothing in him that will cause someone else to stumble.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">But whoever hates a fellow believer lives in the darkness&amp;ndash;stumbling around in the dark with no clue where he is going, for he is blinded by the darkness.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">I remind you, dear children: your sins have been permanently removed because of the power of his name.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">I remind you, fathers and mothers : you have a relationship with the One who has existed from the beginning. And I remind you, young people: you have defeated the Evil One.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">I write these things to you, dear children, because you truly have a relationship with the Father. I write these things, fathers and mothers , because you have had a true relationship with him who is from the beginning. And I write these things, young people, because you are strong, the Word of God is treasured in your hearts, and you have defeated the Evil One.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Don&amp;quot;t set the affections of your heart on this world or in loving the things of the world. The love of the Father and the love of the world are incompatible.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">For all that the world can offer us&amp;ndash;the gratification of our flesh, the allurement of the things of the world, and the obsession with status and importance &amp;ndash;none of these things come from the Father but from the world.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">This world and its desires are in the process of passing away, but those who love to do the will of God live forever.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Dear children, the end of this age is near! You have heard that Antichrist is arising, and in fact, many enemies of Christ have already appeared, and this is how we know that we are living in the closing hour of this age .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">For even though they were once a part of us , they withdrew from us because they were never really of our number. For if they had truly belonged to us they would have continued with us. By leaving our community of believers they made it obvious that they never really belonged to us.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">But the Holy One has anointed you and you all know the truth .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">So I&amp;quot;m writing to you not because you don&amp;quot;t know the truth, but because you do know it, and no lie belongs to the truth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Who is the real liar but the one who denies that Jesus is the Christ. He is the real antichrist, the one who denies the Father and the Son.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">Whoever rejects the Son rejects the Father. Whoever embraces the Son embraces the Father also.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">So you must be sure to keep the message burning in your hearts; that is, the message of life you heard from the beginning. If you do, you will always be living in close fellowship with the Son and with the Father.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">And he himself has promised us the never-ending life of the ages to come!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">I&amp;quot;ve written these things about those who are attempting to lead you astray.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">But the wonderful anointing you have received from God is so much greater than their deception and now lives in you. There&amp;quot;s no need for anyone to keep teaching you. His anointing teaches you all that you need to know, for it will lead you into truth, not a counterfeit. So just as the anointing has taught you, remain in him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">And now, dear children, remain in him, so that when he is revealed we may have joyful confidence and not be ashamed when we stand before him at his appearing.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">If you know that he is righteous, you may be sure that everyone who lives in righteousness has been divinely fathered by him.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="3">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Look with wonder at the depth of the Father&amp;quot;s marvelous love that he has lavished on us! He has called us and made us his very own beloved children. The reason the world doesn&amp;quot;t recognize who we are is that they didn&amp;quot;t recognize him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Beloved, we are God&amp;quot;s children right now; however, it is not yet apparent what we will become. But we do know that when it is finally made visible, we will be just like him, for we will see him as he truly is.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">And all who focus their hope on him will always be purifying themselves, just as Jesus is pure.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Anyone who indulges in sin lives in moral anarchy, for the definition of sin is breaking God&amp;quot;s law.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">And you know without a doubt that Jesus was revealed to eradicate sins, and there is no sin in him. Anyone who continues to live in union with him will not sin.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">But the one who continues sinning hasn&amp;quot;t seen him with discernment or known him by intimate experience .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Delightfully loved children, don&amp;quot;t let anyone divert you from this truth. The person who keeps doing what is right proves that he is righteous before God, even as the Messiah is righteous.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">But the one who indulges in a sinful life is of the devil, because the devil has been sinning from the beginning. The reason the Son of God was revealed was to undo and destroy the works of the devil.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Everyone who is truly God&amp;quot;s child will refuse to keep sinning because God&amp;quot;s seed remains within him, and he is unable to continue sinning because he has been fathered by God himself.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Here is how God&amp;quot;s children can be clearly distinguished from the children of the Evil One. Anyone who does not demonstrate righteousness and show love to fellow believers is not living with God as his source.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">The beautiful message you&amp;quot;ve heard right from the start is that we should walk in self-sacrificing love toward one another.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">We should not be like Cain, who yielded to the Evil One and brutally murdered his own brother, Abel . And why did he murder him? Because his own actions were evil and his brother&amp;quot;s righteous.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">So don&amp;quot;t be shocked, beloved brothers and sisters, if you experience the world&amp;quot;s hatred.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Yet we can be assured that we have been translated from spiritual death into spiritual life because we love the family of believers. A loveless life remains spiritually dead.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Everyone who keeps hating a fellow believer is a murderer, and you know that no murderer has eternal life residing in him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">This is how we have discovered love&amp;quot;s reality: Jesus sacrificed his life for us. Because of this great love, we should be willing to lay down our lives for one another.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">If anyone sees a fellow believer in need and has the means to help him, yet shows no pity and closes his heart against him, how is it even possible that God&amp;quot;s love lives in him?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Beloved children, our love can&amp;quot;t be an abstract theory we only talk about, but a way of life demonstrated through our loving deeds.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">We know that the truth lives within us because we demonstrate love in action, which will reassure our hearts in his presence.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Whenever our hearts make us feel guilty and remind us of our failures , we know that God is much greater and more merciful than our conscience, and he knows everything there is to know about us .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">My delightfully loved friends, when our hearts don&amp;quot;t condemn us, we have a bold freedom to speak face-to-face with God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">And whatever we ask of him we receive, because we keep his commands. And by our beautiful intentions we continue to do what brings pleasure to him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">So these are his commands: that we continually place our trust in the name of his Son, Jesus Christ, and that we keep loving one another, just as he has commanded us.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">For all who obey his commands find their lives joined in union with him, and he lives and flourishes in them. We know and have proof that he constantly lives and flourishes in us, by the Spirit that he has given us.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="4">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Delightfully loved friends, don&amp;quot;t trust every spirit, but carefully examine what they say to determine if they are of God, because many false prophets have mingled into the world.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Here&amp;quot;s the test for those with the genuine Spirit of God: they will confess Jesus as the Christ who has come in the flesh.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Everyone who does not acknowledge that Jesus is from God has the spirit of antichrist, which you heard was coming and is already active in the world.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Little children, you can be certain that you belong to God and have conquered them, for the One who is living in you is far greater than the one who is in the world.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">They belong to this world and they articulate the spirit of this world, and the world listens to them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">But we belong to God, and whoever truly knows God listens to us. Those who refuse to listen to us do not belong to God. That is how we can know the difference between the spirit of truth and the spirit of deceit.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Those who are loved by God, let his love continually pour from you to one another, because God is love. Everyone who loves is fathered by God and experiences an intimate knowledge of him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">The one who doesn&amp;quot;t love has yet to know God, for God is love.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">The light of God&amp;quot;s love shined within us when he sent his matchless Son into the world so that we might live through him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">This is love: He loved us long before we loved him . It was his love, not ours. He proved it by sending his Son to be the pleasing sacrificial offering to take away our sins.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Delightfully loved ones, if he loved us with such tremendous love, then &amp;apos;loving one another&amp;apos; should be our way of life!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">No one has ever gazed upon the fullness of God&amp;quot;s splendor. But if we love one another, God makes his permanent home in us, and we make our permanent home in him, and his love is brought to its full expression in us.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">And he has given us his Spirit within us so that we can have the assurance that he lives in us and that we live in him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Moreover, we have seen with our own eyes and can testify to the truth that Father God has sent his Son to be the Savior of the world.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Those who give thanks that Jesus is the Son of God live in God, and God lives in them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">We have come into an intimate experience with God&amp;quot;s love, and we trust in the love he has for us. God is love! Those who are living in love are living in God, and God lives through them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">By living in God , love has been brought to its full expression in us so that we may fearlessly face the day of judgment, because all that Jesus now is, so are we in this world.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Love never brings fear, for fear is always related to punishment. But love&amp;quot;s perfection drives the fear of punishment far from our hearts. Whoever walks constantly afraid of punishment has not reached love&amp;quot;s perfection.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Our love for others is our grateful response to the love God first demonstrated to us.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Anyone can say, &amp;apos;I love God,&amp;apos; yet have hatred toward another believer. This makes him a phony, because if you don&amp;quot;t love a brother or sister, whom you can see, how can you truly love God, whom you can&amp;quot;t see?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">For he has given us this command: whoever loves God must also demonstrate love to others.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="5">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Everyone who believes that Jesus is the Messiah is God&amp;quot;s spiritual child and has been fathered by God himself. And everyone who loves Father God loves his children as well.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">This is how we can be sure that we love the children of God: by having a passionate love for God and by obedience to his commands.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">True love for God means obeying his commands, and his commands don&amp;quot;t weigh us down as heavy burdens.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">You see , every child of God overcomes the world, for our faith is the victorious power that triumphs over the world.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">So who are the world conquerors, defeating its power ? Those who believe that Jesus is the Son of God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Jesus Christ is the One who was revealed as God&amp;quot;s Son by his water baptism and by the blood of his cross &amp;ndash;not by water only, but by water and blood. And the Spirit, who is truth, confirms this with his testimony.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">So we have these three constant witnesses giving their evidence:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">the Spirit, the water, and the blood. And these three are in agreement.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">If we accept the testimony of men, how much more should we accept the more authoritative testimony of God that he has testified concerning his Son?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Those who believe in the Son of God have the living testimony in their hearts. Those who don&amp;quot;t believe have made God out to be a liar by not believing the testimony God has confirmed about his Son.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">This is the true testimony: that God has given us eternal life, and this life has its source in his Son.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Whoever has the Son has eternal life; whoever does not have the Son does not possess eternal life.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">I&amp;quot;ve written this letter to you who believe in the name of the Son of God so that you will be assured and know without a doubt that you have eternal life.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Since we have this confidence, we can also have great boldness before him, for if we ask anything agreeable to his will, he will hear us.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">And if we know that he hears us in whatever we ask, we also know that we have obtained the requests we ask of him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">If anyone observes a fellow believer habitually sinning in a way that doesn&amp;quot;t lead to death, you should keep interceding in prayer that God will give that person life. Now, there is a sin that leads to death, and I&amp;quot;m not encouraging you to pray for those who commit it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">All unrighteousness is sin, but there is sin that does not result in death.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">We are convinced that everyone fathered by God does not make sinning a way of life, because the Son of God protects the child of God, and the Evil One cannot touch him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">We know that we are God&amp;quot;s children and that the whole world lies under the misery and influence of the Evil One.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">And we know that the Son of God has made our understanding come alive so that we can know by experience the One who is true. And we are in him who is true, God&amp;quot;s Son, Jesus Christ&amp;ndash;the true God and eternal life!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">So, little children, guard yourselves from worshiping anything but him.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="5">Dearest woman, I have a request to make of you. It is not a new commandment but a repetition of the one we have had from the beginning: that we constantly love one another.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">This love means living in obedience to whatever God commands us. For to walk in love toward one another is the unifying commandment we&amp;quot;ve heard from the beginning.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="2">May God&amp;quot;s mercy, peace, and love cascade over you!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Dearly loved friend, I was fully intending to write to you about our amazing salvation we all participate in, but felt the need instead to challenge you to vigorously defend and contend for the beliefs that we cherish. For God, through the apostles , has once for all entrusted these truths to his holy believers.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">There have been some who have sneaked in among you unnoticed. They are depraved people whose judgment was prophesied in Scripture a long time ago. They have perverted the message of God&amp;quot;s grace into a license to commit immorality and turn against our only absolute Master, our Lord Jesus Christ.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">I need to remind you, even though you are familiar with it all, that the Lord Jesus saved his people out of Egypt but subsequently destroyed those who were guilty of unbelief.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">In the same way, there were heavenly messengers in rebellion who went outside their rightful domain of authority and abandoned their appointed realms. God bound them in everlasting chains and is keeping them in the dark abyss of the netherworld until the judgment of the great day.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">In a similar way, the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah and nearby towns gave themselves to sexual immorality and the unnatural desire of different flesh. Now they all serve as examples of those who experience the punishment of eternal fire.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">In the same way, these sensual &amp;apos;dreamers&amp;apos; corrupt and pollute the natural realm, while on the other hand they reject the spiritual realms of governmental power and repeatedly scoff at heavenly glories.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Even the archangel Michael, when he was disputing with the devil over the body of Moses, dared not insult or slander him, but simply said, &amp;apos;The Lord Yahweh rebuke you!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">These people insult anything they don&amp;quot;t understand. They behave like irrational beasts by doing whatever they feel like doing. Because they live by their animal instincts, they corrupt themselves and bring about their own destruction.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">How terrible it is for them! For they have followed in the steps of Cain. They have abandoned themselves to Balaam&amp;quot;s error because of their greedy pursuit of financial gain. And since they have rebelled like Korah rebelled , they will experience the same fate of Korah and likewise perish.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">These false teachers are like dangerous hidden reefs at your love feasts, lying in wait to shipwreck the immature . They feast among you without reverence, having no shepherd but themselves. They are clouds with no rain, swept along by the winds. Like fruitless late-autumn trees &amp;ndash;twice dead, barren, and plucked up by the roots!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">They are wild waves of the sea, flinging out the foam of their shame and disgrace. They are misleading like wandering stars, for whom the complete darkness of eternal gloom has been reserved.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Enoch, the seventh direct descendant from Adam, prophesied of their doom when he said, &amp;apos;Look! Here comes the Lord Yahweh in his myriads of holy ones.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">He comes to execute judgment against them all and to convict each one of them for their ungodly deeds and for all the terrible words that ungodly sinners have spoken against him.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">These people are always complaining and never satisfied&amp;ndash;finding fault with everyone. They follow their own evil desires and their mouths speak scandalous things. They enjoy using seductive flattery to manipulate others.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">But you, my delightfully loved friends, remember the prophecies of the apostles of our Lord Jesus, the Anointed One.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1">This is the unveiling of Jesus Christ, which God gave him to share with his loving servants what must occur swiftly. He signified it by sending his angel to his loving servant John.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">I, John, bore witness to the word of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">A joyous blessing rests upon the one who reads this message and upon those who hear and embrace the words of this prophecy, for the appointed time is in your hands.</VERS>

Now to the one who constantly loves us and has loosed us from our sins by his own blood, Write in a book what you see and send it to the seven churches: to Ephesus, to Smyrna, to Pergamum, to Thyatira, to Sardis, to Philadelphia, and to Laodicea.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="9">I, John, am your brother and companion in tribulation, the kingdom, and the patience that are found in Jesus. I was exiled on the island of Patmos because of the word of God and the testimony of Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">I was in the spirit realm on the Lord&amp;quot;s day, and I heard behind me a loud voice sounding like a trumpet,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">saying to me:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">When I turned to see the voice that was speaking to me, I saw seven golden lampstands.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">And walking among the lampstands, I saw someone like a son of man, wearing a full-length robe with a golden sash over his chest.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">His head and his hair were white like wool&amp;ndash;white as glistening snow. And his eyes were like flames of fire!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">His feet were gleaming like bright metal, as though they were glowing in a fire, and his voice was like the roar of many rushing waters.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="17">When I saw him, I fell down at his feet as good as dead, but he laid his right hand on me and I heard his reassuring voice saying: Don&amp;quot;t yield to fear. I am the Beginning and I am the End,</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="19">Now I want you to write what you have seen, what is, and what comes after the things that I reveal to you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">The mystery of the lampstands and the seven stars is this: the seven lampstands are the seven churches, and the seven stars in my right hand are the seven messengers of the seven churches.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="2">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Write the following to the messenger of the congregation in Ephesus. For these are the words of the one who holds the seven stars firmly in his right hand, who walks among the seven golden lampstands:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">I know all that you&amp;quot;ve done for me&amp;ndash;you have worked hard and persevered. I know that you don&amp;quot;t tolerate evil. You have tested those who claimed to be apostles and proved they are not, for they were imposters.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">I also know how you have bravely endured trials and persecutions because of my name, yet you have not become discouraged.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">But I have this against you: you have abandoned the passionate love you had for me at the beginning.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Think about how far you have fallen! Repent and do the works of love you did at first. I will come to you and remove your lampstand from its place of influence if you do not repent.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Although, to your credit, you despise the practices of the Nicolaitans, which I also despise.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">The one whose heart is open let him listen carefully to what the Spirit is saying now to all the churches. To the one who overcomes I will give access to feast on the fruit of the Tree of Life that is found in the paradise of God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Write the following to the messenger of the congregation in Smyrna. For these are the words of the one who is the Beginning and the End, the one who became a corpse, but came back to life:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">I am aware of all the painful difficulties you have passed through and your financial hardships, even though, in fact, you possess rich treasure. And I am fully aware of the slander that has come against you from those who claim to be Jews but are not, for they are a satanic congregation.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Do not yield to fear in the face of the suffering to come but be aware of this: the devil is about to have some of you thrown into prison to test your faith. For ten days you will have distress but remain faithful to the day you die, and I will give you the victor&amp;quot;s crown of life.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">The one whose heart is open let him listen carefully to what the Spirit is presently saying to all the churches. The one who conquers will not be harmed by the second death.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Write the following to the messenger of the congregation in Pergamum. For these are the words of the one whose words pierce the hearts of men:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">I know where you live&amp;ndash;where Satan sits enthroned, yet you still cling faithfully to the power of my name. You did not deny your faith in me even in the days of my faithful martyr Antipas, who was executed in your city, where Satan lives.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Nevertheless, I have a few things against you. There are some among you who hold to the teachings of Balaam, who taught Balak to entice the Israelites to eat things that were sacrificed to idols and to commit sexual immorality.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Furthermore, you have some who hold to the doctrines of the Nicolaitans.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">So repent, then, or I will come quickly to war against them with the sword of my mouth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">But the one whose heart is open, let him listen carefully to what the Spirit is presently saying to all the churches. To everyone who is victorious I will let him feast on the hidden manna and give him a shining white stone. And written upon the white stone is inscribed his new name, known only to the one who receives it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Write the following to the messenger of the congregation in Thyatira. For these are the words of the Son of God, whose eyes are blazing fire and whose feet are like burnished brass:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">I know all that you&amp;quot;ve done for me&amp;ndash;your love and faith, your ministry and steadfast perseverance. In fact, you now excel in these virtues even more than at the first.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">But I have this against you: you are forgiving that woman Jezebel, who calls herself a prophetess and is seducing my loving servants. She is teaching that it is permissible to indulge in sexual immorality and to eat food sacrificed to idols.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">I have waited for her to repent from her vile immorality, but she willingly refuses to do so.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Now I will lay her low with terrible distress along with all her adulterous partners if they do not repent.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">And I will strike down her followers with a deadly plague. Then all the congregations will realize that I am the one who thoroughly searches the most secret thought and the innermost being. I will give to each one what their works deserve.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">But to the rest of you in Thyatira who don&amp;quot;t adhere to the teachings of Jezebel and have not been initiated into deep satanic secrets, I say to you (without laying upon you any other burden):</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">Cling tightly to all that you have until I appear.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">To everyone who is victorious and continues to do my works to the very end I will give you authority over the nations</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">to shepherd them with a royal scepter. And the rebellious will be shattered as clay pots&amp;ndash;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">even as I also received authority from the presence of my Father. I will give the morning star to the one who experiences victory.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">So the one whose heart is open let him listen carefully to what the Spirit is presently saying to all the churches.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="3">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Write the following to the messenger of the congregation in Sardis, for these are the words of the one who holds the seven Spirits of God and the seven stars: I know all that you do and I know that you have a reputation for being really &amp;apos;alive,&amp;apos; but you&amp;quot;re actually dead!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Wake up and strengthen all that remains before it dies, for I haven&amp;quot;t found your works to be perfect in the sight of my God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">So remember all the things you&amp;quot;ve received and heard, then turn back to God and obey them. For if you continue to slumber, I will come to you like a thief, and you&amp;quot;ll have no idea at what hour I will come.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Yet there are still a few in Sardis who have remained pure, and they will walk in fellowship with me in brilliant light, for they are worthy.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">And the one who experiences victory will be dressed in white robes and I will never, no never erase your name from the Book of Life. I will acknowledge your name before my Father and his angels.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">So the one whose heart is open let him listen carefully to what the Spirit is now saying to all the churches.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Write the following to the messenger of the congregation in Philadelphia, for these are the solemn words of the Holy One, the true one, who has David&amp;quot;s key, who opens doors that none can shut and who closes doors that none can open:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">I know all that you&amp;quot;ve done. Now I have set before you a wide-open door that none can shut. For I know that you possess only a little power, yet you&amp;quot;ve kept my word and haven&amp;quot;t denied my name.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Watch how I deal with those of the synagogue of Satan who say that they are Jews but are not, for they&amp;quot;re lying. I will make them come and bow down at your feet and acknowledge how much I&amp;quot;ve loved you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Because you&amp;quot;ve passionately kept my message of perseverance, I will also keep you from the hour of proving that is coming to test every person on earth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">But I come swiftly, so cling tightly to what you have, so that no one may seize your crown of victory.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">For the one who is victorious, I will make you to be a pillar in the sanctuary of my God, permanently secure. I will write on you the name of my God and the name of the city of my God&amp;ndash;the New Jerusalem, descending from my God out of heaven. And I&amp;quot;ll write my own name on you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">So the one whose heart is open let him listen carefully to what the Spirit is now saying to all the churches.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Write the following to the messenger of the congregation in Laodicea, for these are the words of the Amen, the faithful and true witness, the ruler of God&amp;quot;s creation:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">I know all that you do, and I know that you are neither frozen in apathy nor fervent with passion. How I wish you were either one or the other!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">But because you are neither cold nor hot, but lukewarm, I am about to spit you from my mouth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">For you claim, &amp;apos;I&amp;quot;m rich and getting richer&amp;ndash;I don&amp;quot;t need a thing.&amp;apos; Yet you are clueless that you&amp;quot;re miserable, poor, blind, barren, and naked!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">So I counsel you to purchase gold perfected by fire, so that you can be truly rich. Purchase a white garment to cover and clothe your shameful Adam-nakedness. Purchase eye salve to be placed over your eyes so that you can truly see.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">All those I dearly love I unmask and train. So repent and be eager to pursue what is right.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Behold, I&amp;quot;m standing at the door, knocking. If your heart is open to hear my voice and you open the door within , I will come in to you and feast with you, and you will feast with me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">And to the one who conquers I will give the privilege of sitting with me on my throne, just as I conquered and sat down with my Father on his throne.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">The one whose heart is open let him listen carefully to what the Spirit is saying now to the churches.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="4">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Then suddenly, after I wrote down these messages, I saw a portal open into the heavenly realm, and the same trumpet-voice I heard speaking with me at the beginning said, &amp;apos;Ascend into this realm! I want to reveal to you what must happen after this.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Instantly I was taken into the spirit realm, and behold&amp;ndash;I saw a heavenly throne being set in place and someone seated upon it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">His appearance was sparkling like crystal and glowing like a carnelian gemstone. Surrounding the throne was a circle of green light , like an emerald rainbow.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Encircling the great throne were twenty-four thrones with elders in glistening white garments seated upon them, each wearing a golden crown of victory.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">And pulsing from the throne were blinding flashes of lightning, crashes of thunder, and voices. And burning before the throne were seven blazing torches, which represent the seven Spirits of God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">And in front of the throne there was pavement like a crystal sea of glass. Around the throne and on each side stood four living creatures, full of eyes in front and behind. &amp;apos;Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God, the Almighty! The Was, the Is, and the Coming!&amp;apos; and for your pleasure they were created and exist.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">The first living creature resembled a lion, the second an ox, the third had a human face, and the fourth was like an eagle in flight.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Each of the four living creatures had six wings, full of eyes all around and under their wings. They worshiped without ceasing, day and night, singing,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">And whenever the living creatures gave glory, honor, and thanks to the One who is enthroned and who lives forever and ever,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">the twenty-four elders fell facedown before the one seated on the throne and they worshiped the one who lives forever and ever. And they surrendered their crowns before the throne, singing:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">&amp;apos;You are worthy, our Lord and God, to receive glory, honor, and power, for you created all things,</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="5">
			<VERS vnumber="1">And I saw that the one seated on the throne was holding in his right hand an unopened scroll with writing on the inside and on the outside, and it was sealed with seven seals.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Then I saw an incredibly powerful angel proclaiming with a great, loud voice, &amp;apos;Who is worthy to open the scroll and able to break its seven seals?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">But no person could be found, living or dead, in all of creation &amp;ndash;no one was worthy to open the scroll and read its contents.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">So I broke down weeping with intense sorrow, because there was found no one worthy to break open the scroll and read its contents.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Then one of the elders said to me, &amp;apos;Stop weeping. Look! The mighty Lion of Judah&amp;quot;s tribe, the root of David&amp;ndash;he has conquered! He is the worthy one who can open the scroll and its seven seals.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Then I saw a young Lamb standing before the throne, encircled by the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders. He appeared to have been slaughtered but was now alive ! He had seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God sent out to the ends of the earth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">I saw the young Lamb approach the throne and take the scroll from the right hand of the one who sat there.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">And when the twenty-four elders and the four living creatures saw the Lamb had taken the scroll, they fell facedown at the feet of the Lamb and worshiped him. Each of them had a harp and golden bowls brimming full of sweet fragrant incense&amp;ndash;which are the prayers of God&amp;quot;s holy lovers.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">And they were all singing this new song of praise to the Lamb : &amp;apos;Because you were slaughtered for us, you are worthy to take the scroll and open its seals. Your blood was the price paid to redeem us. You purchased us to bring us to God out of every tribe, language, people group, and nation. and formed us into a kingdom of priests &amp;apos;Worthy is Christ the Lamb who was slaughtered to receive great power and might, wealth and wisdom, and honor, glory, and praise!&amp;apos; &amp;apos;Praise, honor, glory, and dominion be to God-Enthroned and to Christ the Lamb forever and ever!&amp;apos; &amp;apos;Amen!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">You have chosen us to serve our God who reign on the earth.&amp;apos; And the twenty-four elders threw themselves facedown to the ground and worshiped.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Then I looked, and I heard the voices of myriads of angels in circles around the throne, as well as the voices of the living creatures and the elders&amp;ndash;myriads and myriads!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">And as I watched, all of them were singing with thunderous voices:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Then every living being joined the angelic choir. Every creature in heaven and on earth, under the earth, in the sea, and everything in them, were worshiping with one voice, saying:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Then the four living creatures responded:</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="6">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Then I watched as the Lamb broke open the first of the seven seals. Immediately I heard one of the four living creatures call out with a powerful voice of revelation sounding like thunder, saying, &amp;apos;Come forth!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">So I looked, and behold, there was a bright white horse. Its rider had a bow and was given a crown of victory. He rode out as a conqueror ready to conquer.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">When he broke open the second seal, I heard the second living creature call out: &amp;apos;Come forth!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">And there appeared another horse, red like fiery flames , and its rider was given a great sword and the power to take peace from the earth, causing one to put to death another.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Then he broke open the third seal, and I heard the third living creature call out, &amp;apos;Come forth!&amp;apos; And behold, I saw a black horse right in front of me, and its rider was holding measuring scales.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">And I heard what seemed to be a voice from among the living creatures saying, &amp;apos;A small measure of wheat for a day&amp;quot;s pay, and three measures of barley for a day&amp;quot;s pay, but don&amp;quot;t harm the olive trees producing oil and the vines producing wine.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">When he broke open the fourth seal, I heard the fourth living creature call out, &amp;apos;Come forth!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">And behold, I saw a green horse, and its rider&amp;quot;s name was Death, and Death&amp;quot;s Domain followed him. They were given authority over a fourth of the earth, to kill with sword, famine, death, and by the wild beasts.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">When the Lamb broke open the fifth seal, I saw gathered under the altar the souls of those who had been slain because of the Word of God and because they had the testimony of the Lamb.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">They cried out with a loud voice, saying, &amp;apos;Sovereign Lord, holy and dependable, how long before you judge those who live on the earth and vindicate our blood on them?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Each one was given a glistening white robe. And they were told to rest a little longer, until the full number was fulfilled of both their fellow servants and brothers and sisters who were going to be killed just as they had been.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">And behold! I saw the Lamb break open the sixth seal, which released a powerful earthquake. I saw the sun become pitch black and the full moon become bloodred.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">The stars fell from heaven to the earth, as a fig tree shaken by a stormy wind sheds its unripe figs.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">The sky receded with a snap&amp;ndash;as a scroll rolls itself up. And every mountain and island was moved from its place.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Then the kings of the earth and its great princes and generals, the rich and powerful, and everyone, whether they were slave or free, ran for cover and hid in the caves and among the mountain boulders.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">They called out to the mountains and the boulders, saying, &amp;apos;Fall on us at once! Hide us quickly from the glorious face of the one seated on the throne and from the wrath of the Lamb,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">for the great day of their wrath has come, and who is able to stand?&amp;apos;</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="7">
			<VERS vnumber="1">After this I saw four angels standing at the four corners of the earth, and they were restraining the four winds so that no wind would blow on the land, on the sea, or on any tree.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Then I saw another angel ascending from the east, who had the seal of the living God. He shouted out with a loud voice to the four angels who had been given power to damage earth and sea,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">saying, &amp;apos;Do not damage the earth, the sea, or the trees until we have marked the loving servants of our God with a seal on their foreheads.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">And I discovered the number of those who were sealed. It was one hundred and forty-four thousand, sealed out of every tribe of Israel&amp;quot;s people.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Twelve thousand were sealed from the tribe of Judah. Twelve thousand were sealed from the tribe of Reuben. Twelve thousand were sealed from the tribe of Gad. Twelve thousand were sealed from the tribe of Naphtali. Twelve thousand were sealed from the tribe of Manasseh. Twelve thousand were sealed from the tribe of Levi. Twelve thousand were sealed from the tribe of Issachar. Twelve thousand were sealed from the tribe of Joseph. Twelve thousand were sealed from the tribe of Benjamin. Then he said to me, &amp;apos;They are ones who have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb and have emerged from the midst of great pressure and ordeal.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Twelve thousand were sealed from the tribe of Asher.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Twelve thousand were sealed from the tribe of Simeon.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Twelve thousand were sealed from the tribe of Zebulun.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">After this I looked, and behold, right in front of me I saw a vast multitude of people&amp;ndash;an enormous multitude so huge that no one could count&amp;ndash;made up of victorious ones from every nation, tribe, people group, and language. They were all in glistening white robes, standing before the throne and before the Lamb with palm branches in their hands.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">And they shouted out with a passionate voice: &amp;apos;Salvation belongs to our God seated on the throne and to the Lamb!&amp;apos; &amp;apos;Amen! Praise and glory, wisdom and thanksgiving, honor, power, and might belong to our God forever and ever! Amen!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">All the angels were standing in a circle around the throne with the elders and the four living creatures, and they all fell on their faces before the throne and worshiped God,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">singing:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Then one of the elders asked me, &amp;apos;Who are these in glistening white robes, and where have they come from?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">I answered, &amp;apos;My lord&amp;ndash;you must know.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">For this reason they are before the throne of God, ministering to him as priests day and night, within his cloud-filled sanctuary. And the enthroned One spreads over them his tabernacle-shelter.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Their souls will be completely satisfied. And neither the sun nor any scorching heat will affect them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">For the Lamb at the center of the throne continuously shepherds them unto life &amp;ndash;guiding them to the everlasting fountains of the water of life. And God will wipe from their eyes every last tear!&amp;apos;</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="8">
			<VERS vnumber="1">When the Lamb broke open the seventh seal, heaven fell silent for about half an hour.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">And then I saw the seven angels who stand before God, and each was given a trumpet.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Then the eighth angel with a golden incense burner came and took his place at the incense altar. He was given a great quantity of incense to offer up, consisting of the prayers of God&amp;quot;s holy people, upon the golden altar that is before the throne.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">And the smoke of the incense with the prayers of the holy ones billowed up before God from the hand of the angel.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Then the angel filled the golden incense burner with coals of fire from the altar and hurled it onto the earth, releasing great peals of thunder, voices, lightning flashes, and an earthquake.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Then the seven angels prepared to sound their trumpets.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">When the first angel sounded his trumpet, there came forth hail and fire mixed with blood, and it was hurled to the earth. A third of the earth was burned up, destroying a third of the trees and all green grass.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">When the second angel sounded his trumpet, something like a huge mountain burning with flames of fire was thrown into the sea, destroying a third of the ships.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">A third of the sea turned into blood, destroying a third of all sea creatures.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">The third angel sounded his trumpet, and a megastar, blazing like a torch, descended from heaven upon a third of the rivers and fountains.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">The name of the star is Bitterness. A third of the waters became so bitter that many people died.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">The fourth angel sounded his trumpet and a third of the sun was struck, and a third of the moon, and a third of the stars, so that a third of their light was darkened, and there was no light for a third of the day and likewise the night.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Then I saw and heard an eagle flying overhead, crying out with a loud voice, &amp;apos;Woe, woe, woe, to the people of the earth, because of the next three trumpets about to be sounded by the other three angels!&amp;apos;</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1">Then the fifth angel sounded his trumpet, and I saw a star that fell from heaven to earth, and he was handed the key to the shaft leading down to the pit of the deep.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="3">And out of the smoke appeared locusts swarming onto the earth, and they were given authority like that of scorpions to inflict pain .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">They were told not to harm the grass, or any green growth or any tree, but only to afflict those who did not have the seal of God on their foreheads.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">The locusts were given authority to torment them for five months, but not to kill them. Their painful torment is like the scorpion&amp;quot;s sting,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">and during that time people will seek death but will not find it; they will long to die but death will elude them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">The locusts had the appearance of horses equipped for battle. On their heads were what seemed like golden crowns. And their faces were like human faces.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Their hair was long , like women&amp;quot;s hair, and their teeth like lion&amp;quot;s teeth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">They wore breastplates that seemed like iron, and their wings made a sound like the noise of horses and chariots rushing into battle.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">They had tails and stingers like scorpions, with power to injure people for five months.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">The angel of the bottomless pit was king over them, and his name in Hebrew is Destruction and in Greek Destroyer.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">This is but the first woe; there are still two more to come.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Then the sixth angel sounded his trumpet, and I heard a voice from the four horns of the golden altar before God,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">responding to the sixth angel, who blew his trumpet, &amp;apos;Set free the four angels who are confined at the great river Euphrates.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">So the four angels were released, who had been prepared for the right hour, day, month, and year, to kill a third of humanity.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">I heard the number of soldiers on horseback&amp;ndash;it was twice ten thousand times ten thousand.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">And in my vision I saw the horses with riders wearing breastplates of fire and of sapphire and of sulfur. The horses had lions&amp;quot; heads breathing out fire and smoke and sulfur.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">They killed a third of humanity by these three plagues&amp;ndash;the fire, the smoke, and the sulfur that came from their mouths.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">For the lethal power of the horses was in their mouths and their tails, and their tails had snakes&amp;quot; heads that inflict injuries.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Those not killed by these plagues did not repent of their deeds so that they would stop worshiping demons and idols of gold, silver, bronze, stone, and wood&amp;ndash;blind and mute idols that have to be carried around.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">And they did not repent of their murders or their sorceries or their thefts or their immorality.</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="10">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Then I saw another extremely powerful messenger coming out of heaven, robed in a cloud. There was a halo over his head like a rainbow; his face shined bright like the sun, and his legs like pillars of fire.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">He held an opened scroll in his hand. He set his right foot on the sea and his left foot on the land</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">and gave a tremendous shout, like a lion&amp;quot;s roar. When he shouted, the seven thunders responded, rumbling out their messages .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">I was about to write the messages of the seven thunders, but I heard a heavenly voice say to me: Don&amp;quot;t write a word, but place a seal on what the seven thunders have spoken. Go, take the open scroll from the hand of the angel who is standing on the sea and on the land.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Then the mighty angel whom I saw astride the sea and the land raised his right hand to heaven</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">and swore an oath by him who lives for an eternity of eternities, the Creator of heaven and earth and sea and all that is in them: No more delay!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">For in the day when the seventh angel is to sound his trumpet, the mystery of God will be fulfilled, just as he announced to his servants the prophets.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Then the heavenly voice spoke to me again:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">I went up to the angel who stood on the sea and the land and told him to give me the little scroll. Then he said to me, &amp;apos;Take it, and eat it. It will be sour in your stomach but sweet as honey in your mouth.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">I took the little scroll from the hand of the mighty angel and ate it. Indeed, it was sweet as honey to taste, but after I had eaten it, my stomach turned bitter.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Then they said to me, &amp;apos;You must go back and prophesy again to many peoples, and nations, and languages, and kings!&amp;apos;</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="11">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Then a measuring rod, like a staff, was given to me and I was told: Rise and measure God&amp;quot;s temple and the altar and count those who worship in it. &amp;apos;The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our God and of his Anointed One! because you have established both small and great. who corrupt the earth!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">But exclude the courtyard outside the temple, for it has been given over to the nations, and for forty-two months they will trample on the holy city.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">And I will authorize my two witnesses to prophesy, wearing sackcloth for one thousand two hundred and sixty days.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">These two witnesses are the two olive trees and the two lampstands that stand before the Lord God of the whole earth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">If anyone attempts to harm them, fire will flow out of their mouths and consume their foes. All who seek to harm them will die in this way.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">They have authority to shut the heavens so that no rain will fall during the days of their prophesying. They have authority over the waters to turn them into blood and to strike the earth with every plague imaginable, as often as they desire.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">When their testimony is completed, the beast that comes up from the bottomless pit will wage war against them and conquer them and kill them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Their dead bodies will lie on the street of the great city that is symbolically called Sodom and Egypt, where their Lord was also crucified.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">For three and a half days people from every ethnicity, tribe, nation, and language will see their corpses, because no one is permitted to bury them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">The entire world will gloat over them and celebrate and exchange gifts, because these two prophets had condemned those who dwell on the earth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">After three and a half days God&amp;quot;s breath of life entered them and they stood to their feet, terrifying all who saw them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Then they heard a loud shout from heaven saying to them: Come up here! The two prophets climbed up into heaven in a cloud while their enemies watched. He will reign supreme for an eternity of eternities!&amp;apos; &amp;apos;We give thanks to you, Lord God Almighty, who is, and who was, your great and limitless power and begun to reign! and the time for judging the dead has come. The time has come to reward your servants, the prophets and the holy ones and all who reverence your name, And the time has come to destroy those</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">At that very moment there was a powerful earthquake and a tenth of the city collapsed, killing seven thousand people. The rest were terrified and gave glory to the God of heaven.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Now the second woe has passed and the third is coming swiftly.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Then the seventh angel sounded his trumpet, and a loud voice broke forth in heaven, saying:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Then the twenty-four elders who sit on their thrones before God fell facedown before him and worshiped him,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">saying:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">The nations were furious, and you became furious,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Then God&amp;quot;s temple was opened in heaven and the ark of his covenant was clearly visible inside his temple. And there were blinding flashes of lightning, voices roaring, startling thunderclaps, a massive earthquake, and a great hailstorm!</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="12">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Then an astonishing miracle-sign appeared in heaven. I saw a woman clothed with the brilliance of the sun, and the moon was under her feet. She was wearing on her head a victor&amp;quot;s crown of twelve stars.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">She was pregnant and was crying out in labor pains, in the agony of giving birth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Consider this : another astonishing miracle-sign appeared in heaven! I saw a huge, fiery-red dragon with ten horns and seven heads, each wearing a royal crown. He was wearing seven royal crowns.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">The dragon&amp;quot;s massive tail swept across the sky and dragged away a third of the stars of heaven and cast them to the earth. And the dragon crouched before the woman who was about to give birth&amp;ndash;poised to devour the baby the moment it was born.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">She gave birth to a man-child who is about to rule and shepherd every nation with an iron scepter, and her son was caught up to God and to his throne.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">The woman fled into the wilderness, where God had already prepared a safe place for her, and there they nourished her for one thousand two hundred and sixty days.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Then a terrible war broke out in heaven. Michael and his angels fought against the great dragon. The dragon and his angels fought back.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">But the dragon did not have the power to win and they could not regain their place in heaven.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">So the great dragon was thrown down once and for all. He was the serpent, the ancient snake called the devil, and Satan, who deceives the whole earth. He was cast down into the earth and his angels along with him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Then I heard a triumphant voice in heaven proclaiming: &amp;apos;Now salvation and power are set in place, and the kingdom reign of our God and the ruling authority of his Anointed One are established. For the accuser of our brothers and sisters, who relentlessly accused them day and night before our God, has now been defeated &amp;ndash;cast out once and for all! through the blood of the Lamb They triumphed because they did not love and cling to their own lives, even when faced with death. and every heavenly being! But woe to the earth and the sea, for the devil has come down to you with great fury, because he knows his time is short.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">They conquered him completely and the powerful word of his testimony.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">So rejoice, you heavens,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Now, when the dragon realized that he had been cast down to the earth, he set off in pursuit of the woman who had given birth to the man-child.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">But the two wings of the great eagle were given to the woman so that she could fly and escape into the wilderness to her own special place, where she was nourished for a time, and times, and half a time, away from the face of the dragon.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Then the dragon spewed from his mouth a raging river of water to sweep her away with the flood.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">But the earth came to the rescue of the woman and at once opened its mouth and swallowed the river that the dragon had poured from his mouth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Then the dragon became enraged at the woman and went off to make war against the remnant of her offspring who follow the commands of God and have the testimony of Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">And the dragon took his stand on the sand of the seashore.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="13">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Then I saw a wild beast rising from the sea with ten horns and seven heads. On its horns were ten royal crowns, and on its heads were blasphemous names.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">It was like a leopard with feet like a bear&amp;quot;s, and its mouth like the mouth of a lion. The dragon shared his power, throne, and great authority with the wild beast.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">One of the heads of the wild beast seemed to have received a deathly wound, but the wound had been healed. After this, the whole world was filled with fascination and followed the wild beast.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">They worshiped the dragon because he had given the beast its ruling authority. They also worshiped the wild beast, saying, &amp;apos;Who is like the wild beast? And who is able to make war against him?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">The wild beast was given a mouth to speak boastful and blasphemous words, and he was permitted to exercise authority for forty-two months.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">So the wild beast began to blaspheme against God, blaspheming his holy name and his dwelling place; that is, those who dwell in heaven.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">The beast was given the authority to wage war against the holy believers. And he was given authority over every tribe, people, language, and nation.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Everyone on earth will worship the wild beast&amp;ndash;those whose names have not been written from the foundation of the world in the Book of the Life of the Lamb who was slain.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">If anyone has been given ears to hear, he&amp;quot;d better listen!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">For the one who leads others into captivity, into captivity he goes. The one who kills others by the sword, by the sword he will be put to death. This is a call for the endurance and faithfulness of the holy believers.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Then I saw another wild beast coming up from the ground. It had two horns like a ram, but it spoke like the dragon.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">It operated in all the authority of the first beast on its behalf, causing the earth and its inhabitants to worship the first beast, whose mortal wound had been healed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">It performed great miracle-signs, even publicly causing fire to fall out of heaven to the earth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">And through these startling miracles that he performed on behalf of the first beast, he deceived the world, telling the people to erect a statue in the image of the beast that had been wounded by the sword and yet lived.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">The beast from the earth was empowered to breathe life into the image of the first beast so that it could speak and kill those who refused to worship its image.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">It also caused everyone, small and great, rich and poor, free and bound, to be marked on the right hand or on the forehead.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">This meant no one could buy or sell unless they had the mark; that is, the name of the beast or its number.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">This will require wisdom to understand: Let the one with insight interpret the number of the wild beast, for it is humanity&amp;quot;s number &amp;ndash;666.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="14">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Then I looked, and behold&amp;ndash;there was the young Lamb standing on Mount Zion and with him 144,000 who had his name and his Father&amp;quot;s name written on their foreheads.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">And I heard a tremendous sound coming out of heaven, like the roar of a waterfall and like the earsplitting sound of a thunderclap. The sound of music that I heard was like the sound of many harpists playing their harps.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">And they were singing a wonderful new song before the throne, in front of the four living creatures, and in front of the twenty-four elders.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">No one could learn that song except the 144,000 who had been redeemed and who have not defiled themselves with women, for they are virgins, and they join themselves to the Lamb wherever he goes. They have been purchased from humanity and brought forth as the firstfruits for God and the Lamb.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Their words are always true; they are without flaw.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Then I witnessed another angel flying in the sky, carrying a message of eternal good news to announce to the earth&amp;ndash;to every tribe, language, people, and nation.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">With a loud voice he shouted, &amp;apos;You must reverence God and glorify him, for the time has come for him to judge. Worship at the feet of the Creator of heaven, earth, sea, and springs of water.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Then a second angel followed, declaring, &amp;apos;She fell! She fell! Babylon the great is fallen! She once seduced the nations and made them all drink the wine of the passion of her harlotry!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Then a third angel followed them, shouting with a mighty voice, &amp;apos;Whoever worships the wild beast and its image, and receives a mark on his forehead or on his hand,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">will also drink the wine of God&amp;quot;s wrath. This wine has been poured out and mixed in the cup of his indignation. They will be tormented with sulfur and fire in the presence of holy angels and of the Lamb.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">And the smoke of their severe suffering ascends into ages upon ages. Those who worship the wild beast and its image and receive the mark of its name will have no rest day or night.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">This is a call for the endurance and faithfulness of the holy believers&amp;ndash;those who follow God&amp;quot;s commands and cling to the faith of Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Then I heard a voice from the heavenly realm, saying, &amp;apos;Write this: Blessed are the dead&amp;ndash;the ones dying in the Lord from now on.&amp;apos; &amp;apos;Yes,&amp;apos; says the Holy Spirit, &amp;apos;they will rest from their trouble, for their deeds will live on!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">I looked and behold&amp;ndash;I saw a white cloud, and sitting upon it was one like the Son of Man, wearing a golden crown and holding a sharp sickle.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Another angel came out of the temple, shouting out to the one sitting upon the cloud, &amp;apos;Take your sickle and reap, for the time of reaping the harvest has come and the harvest of the earth is ripe!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">So the one sitting upon the white cloud gave his sickle a mighty swing over the earth and reaped its harvest.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Then another angel came out of the heavenly temple, and he too had a sharp sickle.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">And another angel came out from the altar of incense &amp;ndash;the angel with authority over fire. He shouted out with a loud voice to the one who had the sharp sickle, saying, &amp;apos;Take now your sharp sickle and harvest the clusters of the vine of the earth, for its grapes are ripe.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">So the angel gave his sickle a mighty swing over the earth and gathered the grapes from the vine of the earth and threw them into the great winepress of the wrath of God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">And the winepress was trodden outside the city until blood poured out of the winepress as high as the horse&amp;quot;s bridle for a distance of one thousand six hundred stadia.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="15">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Then I witnessed another great and astonishing sign in heaven: seven angels bringing the last seven plagues, for with them the wrath of God is finished.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Then I saw what looked like a vast sea of glass blended with fiery flames. Standing beside the sea were those who continually conquer the wild beast, his image and the number of his name.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">They each held the harps of God and they were singing the song of Moses, God&amp;quot;s servant, and the song of the Lamb: &amp;apos;Mighty and marvelous are your miracles, Righteous and true are your ways, and bring glory to your name? For you alone are holy, and all nations will come and bow in worship before you, Lord Yahweh , God Almighty! O Sovereign King of the ages! as your blessings have revealed.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Who will not reverence you with awe, O Lord,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">After these things I looked, and behold, the inner sanctuary of the heavenly &amp;apos;tabernacle of testimony&amp;apos; was opened before my eyes.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">The seven angels with the seven last plagues came out of the sanctuary in glistening robes of bright linen and golden sashes around their chests.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Then one of the four living creatures gave each of the seven angels a golden bowl full of the wrath of God, who lives forever and ever.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">The sanctuary was filled with the thick cloud of smoke billowing out from the glory and power of God&amp;ndash;and no one could even enter the sanctuary until the seven plagues of the seven angels were completed.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="16">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Then I heard a loud voice from within the sanctuary telling the seven angels, &amp;apos;Go and pour out on the earth the seven bowls of the wrath of God.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">So the first angel poured his bowl upon the earth, causing ugly and painful sores to break out on the people who had the mark of the wild beast and worshiped his image.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Then the second angel poured his bowl into the sea, and it became like the blood of the dead&amp;ndash;every living thing in the sea died.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">The third angel poured his bowl into the rivers and springs of water, and they became blood. And I heard the angel of the waters say:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">&amp;apos;O holy One, who are and were, you are righteous, for you have judged these things, &amp;apos;Here it comes!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">because they shed the blood of your saints and prophets. They got what they deserved, for you gave them blood to drink!&amp;apos; &amp;apos;Yes, O Lord God, the Almighty! Every judicial verdict you make is just and right.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Then I heard a voice from before the altar reply:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Then the fourth angel poured out his bowl on the sun, and it began to burn the people with a scorching heat.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Though they endured the fierce heat, yet the people continued to blaspheme God. They cursed the name of God, who had authority over these plagues, and refused to repent and give him glory.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">The fifth angel poured his bowl on the throne of the wild beast, and its kingdom was plunged into darkness. People were in agony and gnawed their tongues</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">and cursed the God of heaven because of their painful sores, refusing to repent of their deeds.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">The sixth angel poured his bowl on &amp;apos;the good and abounding river,&amp;apos; and it completely dried up in order to prepare the way for the kings of the east.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Then I saw three unclean spirits like frogs belched from the mouths of the dragon, the wild beast, and the false prophet.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">They were demonic spirits performing signs, and they entered into the kings of the world to draw them into battle on the great day of God, the Almighty.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">&amp;apos;Behold, I come like a thief! God&amp;quot;s blessing is with the one who remains awake and fully clothed in me and will not walk about naked, exposed to disgrace.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">The demonic spirits assembled the kings together at the place called in Hebrew the &amp;apos;Mount of the Governor.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">The seventh angel poured out his bowl into the air, and a loud voice came out from the temple and from the throne, saying:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Then there were flashes of lightning, voices, crashes of thunder, and a massive earthquake&amp;ndash;the most severe to shake the earth since the creation of man, so tremendous was that earthquake!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">It split the great city Babylon into three parts, and other cities of the nations collapsed. For God remembered great Babylon and her winecup filled with his fiery wrath.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Every island fled away and the mountains were no more.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Enormous hailstones, each weighing nearly one hundred pounds, fell from the sky and struck the people, yet they continued to curse God because of the horrendous plague of hail.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="17">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Then one of the seven angels with the seven bowls approached me and said, &amp;apos;Come, and I will show you the judgment of the great prostitute who sits enthroned on many waters.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">The kings of the earth have fornicated with her, and the people of earth are drunk on the wine of her prostitution.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Then the angel carried me away in the Spirit into a wilderness, and I saw a woman sitting on a wild, bloodred beast with seven heads and ten horns, and it was covered with blasphemous names.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">The woman was robed in purple and scarlet and was glittering with gold, precious stones, and pearls. She was holding in her hand a golden chalice brimming full with defiling obscenities and the filth of her lewdness.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">On her forehead was written these mysterious titles: &amp;apos;The great Babylon, mother of prostitutes and of the abominations of the earth.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">I saw the woman was drunk with the blood of God&amp;quot;s holy believers&amp;ndash;drunk on the blood of the loyal martyrs of Jesus. And when I saw her, I was utterly astonished!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">But the angel said to me, &amp;apos;Why are you so astonished? I will reveal to you the mystery of the woman, and of the wild beast with seven heads and ten horns that carries her.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">The wild beast you saw once was, now is not, and is destined to ascend out of the deep and go to destruction. All those whose names have not been written in the Book of Life from the foundation of the world will be utterly astonished when they see the wild beast because he once was, now is not, and is about to rise.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">&amp;apos;This requires a mind that has wisdom to interpret: The seven heads of the beast are seven mountains the woman sits upon; they are also seven kings.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Five kings have fallen, one is, and the other has not yet come&amp;ndash;and when he comes he must remain only a little while.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">The wild beast that was but now is not represents an eighth king who is from one of the seven, and he is going to destruction.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">&amp;apos;The ten horns that you saw represent ten kings who have not yet received a kingdom, but they and the wild beast are destined to receive authority as kings for a short reign of one hour.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">They are united in yielding their power and authority to the wild beast.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">They will wage war against the Lamb, but the Lamb will conquer them, for he is Lord of lords and King of kings! Those who are with him will also conquer them , and they are called &amp;quot;chosen ones&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;faithful ones.&amp;quot; &amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">And he said to me, &amp;apos;The waters that you saw, upon which the great prostitute is seated, represent peoples, multitudes, nations, and languages.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">The ten horns and the wild beast will hate the great prostitute and will make her a ruin. They will reduce her to nakedness, and they will devour her flesh and burn her up with fire.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">For God has put it in their hearts to carry out his purpose for her by agreeing to give their kingdom to the wild beast until the words of God are fulfilled.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">As for the woman you saw, she is the great city Babylon , which rules over the kings of the earth.&amp;apos;</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="18">
			<VERS vnumber="1">After these things, I saw another angel coming from the heavenly realm with great authority, and the earth was flooded with the brilliance of his splendor.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">He shouted out with a thunderous voice: &amp;apos;Fallen, fallen is Babylon the great! She has become a demonic dwelling place, a prison for every unclean spirit, unclean bird, of the wine of her immoral passion, and the kings of the earth and merchants of the earth have grown wealthy because of her power and luxury.&amp;apos; &amp;apos;My people, come out from her so that you don&amp;quot;t participate in her sins and have no share with her in her plagues, that she has treated others with&amp;ndash; pay her back double for all her deeds and lived luxuriously, give her that measure of torment and grief, because she said in her heart, &amp;quot;I am no widow; I rule as a queen!

For in one moment you suffered such destruction&amp;ndash; you who once made the merchants on the sea so very wealthy. You apostles and prophets and holy believers, rejoice! For on your behalf God pronounced the judgment against her that she wanted to bring upon you!&amp;apos; &amp;apos;With this kind of sudden violence, the great city Babylon will be thrown down and exist no more. will never grace your city again.

			<VERS vnumber="4">Then I heard another voice from heaven saying:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">because her sins are heaped as high as heaven</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">So repay to her double the same treatment</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">With the same measure she exalted herself</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Therefore, her plagues will fall on her in one day&amp;ndash;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">The kings of the earth who fornicated with her and lived in luxury with her will weep and wail over her when they see the smoke of the fire that burns her up.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">And they will stand far off, in fear of her torment, saying:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">The earth&amp;quot;s merchants weep and mourn for her because no one buys their merchandise anymore:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">their gold, silver, jewels, and pearls, their fine linen, purple cloth, silk, and scarlet cloth, all kinds of things made from expensive wood, ivory, bronze, iron, and marble,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">quantities of the finest cinnamon, spice, incense, frankincense, and myrrh, wine, olive oil, wheat, and the finest flour, sheep, cattle, horses, and their four-wheeled carriages, and the trafficking of the bodies and souls of people.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">And they will say:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Those who sold these things and grew wealthy through their business with her will stand far off, terrified over her torment. They will weep and mourn, saying:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">&amp;apos;How horrible!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">in one brief moment such vast wealth is now laid waste!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">and cried out as they saw her go up in flames:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">As a sign of their dismay , they threw dust on their heads</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Rejoice over her, O heaven</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Then a mighty angel took up a stone, like a huge millstone, and threw it into the sea, saying:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">The music of harps, minstrels, flutes, and trumpets</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">The light of a lamp will never shine in you again,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">For the bloodstains of the holy believers and the prophets</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="19">
			<VERS vnumber="1">After this I heard what seemed to be the roar of a great multitude of voices, saying: &amp;apos;Hallelujah! Salvation and glory and power to our God! For he has judged the great prostitute who corrupted the earth with her sexual immorality. He has avenged on her the blood of his loving servants.&amp;apos; &amp;apos;Hallelujah! The smoke from her destruction goes up forever and ever!&amp;apos; &amp;apos;Amen! Hallelujah!&amp;apos; &amp;apos;Praise our God, all you his loving servants and all who reverence and honor him&amp;ndash; those who are lowly and those who are great!&amp;apos; &amp;apos;Hallelujah! has been given to her to wear, and the fine linen represents</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">All his judgments are right and true,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">And again they shouted:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">The twenty-four elders and the four living creatures fell facedown and worshiped God, who sits on the throne, saying in agreement :</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Then a voice came from the throne, saying:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Then I heard what seemed to be the thunderous voice of a great multitude, like the sound of a massive waterfall and mighty peals of thunder, crying out: For the Lord our God, the Almighty, reigns! because the wedding celebration of the Lamb has come. And his bride has made herself ready. the righteous deeds of his holy believers.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Let us rejoice and exalt him and give him glory,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Fine linen, shining bright and clear,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Then the angel said to me, &amp;apos;Write these words: Wonderfully blessed are those who are invited to feast at the wedding celebration of the Lamb!&amp;apos; And then he said to me, &amp;apos;These are the true words of God.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">At this I fell facedown at the angel&amp;quot;s feet to worship him, but he stopped me and said, &amp;apos;Don&amp;quot;t do this! For I am only a fellow servant with you and one of your brothers who clings to what Jesus testifies. Worship God. The testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Then I saw heaven opened, and suddenly a white horse appeared. The name of the one riding it was Faithful and True, and with pure righteousness he judges and rides to battle.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">He wore many regal crowns, and his eyes were flashing like flames of fire. He had a secret name inscribed on him that&amp;quot;s known only to himself.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">He wore a robe dipped in blood, and his title is called the Word of God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Following him on white horses were the armies of heaven, wearing white fine linen, pure and bright.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">A sharp sword came from his mouth with which to conquer the nations, and he will shepherd them with an iron scepter. He will trample out the wine in the winepress of the wrath of God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">On his robe and on his thigh he had inscribed a name: King of kings and Lord of lords.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Then I saw an angel standing in the sun, shouting to all the flying birds of the sky, &amp;apos;Come and gather for God&amp;quot;s great supper!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Come and devour the flesh of the kings, generals, and soldiers, the flesh of horses and their riders, the flesh of all people, slave or free, lowly or famous.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Then I saw the wild beast and the kings of the earth with their armies gathered to wage war against the rider on the white horse and against his armies.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">The wild beast was captured, as was the false prophet who had performed miracle-signs in his presence. (It was by these miracle-signs that he had deceived those with the mark of the wild beast and those who worshiped its image.) The wild beast and the false prophet were both thrown alive into the lake of fire burning with sulfur,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">and their armies were killed by the sharp sword that came from the mouth of the rider on the white horse. And all the birds gorged themselves with their flesh.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="20">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Then I saw a mighty angel descending from the heavenly realm, holding a heavy chain and a key&amp;ndash;the key of the deep.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">He seized the dragon, that ancient serpent known as the devil and Satan, and bound him for a thousand years.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">The mighty angel threw him into the pit, locked it, and sealed it so that he could no longer deceive the nations until the thousand years were over. (After that he must be loosed for a brief time.)</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Then I saw thrones, and those who sat on them were given the authority to judge. I also saw the souls of those who had been beheaded because of the testimony of Jesus and for the Word of God. They had refused to worship the wild beast or its image and did not have their foreheads or hands marked by the wild beast. They lived and reigned with the Christ for one thousand years.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">This is the first resurrection. (The rest of the dead did not come to life until the thousand years were ended.)</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Wonderfully blessed and holy are those who share in the first resurrection! The second death holds no power over them, but they will be priests of God and of the Christ. And they will reign as kings with him a thousand years!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">After the thousand years are over, Satan will be let loose from his prison</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">and will go out and deceive the nations of the four corners of the earth, Gog and Magog. He will bring them together for battle, and they will be as numerous as grains of sand on the seashore.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">They spread out over the earth and surrounded the camp of God&amp;quot;s holy believers and the beloved city. But fire came down from heaven and completely destroyed them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Then the devil who had deceived them was thrown into the same place with the wild beast and the false prophet&amp;ndash;the lake of fire and sulfur&amp;ndash;where they will be tormented day and night forever and ever.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Then I saw a great, dazzling-white throne and the One who sits on it. Heaven and earth fled from his presence and they were no more.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">I saw the dead, the lowly and the famous alike, standing before the throne. Books were opened, and then another book was opened: the Book of Life. The dead were judged by what they had done as recorded in the books.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">And the sea gave up the dead souls that were in it. Then death and the underworld gave up their dead, and all were judged according to what they had done.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Then death and the realm of the dead were cast into the lake of fire, for the lake of fire is the second death.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">And anyone whose name was not recorded in the Book of Life was cast into the lake of fire.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="21">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Then in a vision I saw a new heaven and a new earth. The first heaven and earth had passed away, and the sea no longer existed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">I saw the Holy City, the New Jerusalem, descending out of the heavenly realm from the presence of God, like a pleasing bride that had been prepared for her husband, adorned for her wedding .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">And I heard a thunderous voice from the throne, saying: &amp;apos;Look! God&amp;quot;s tabernacle is with human beings. And from now on he will tabernacle with them as their God. Now God himself will have his home with them&amp;ndash; and eliminate death entirely. No one will mourn or weep any longer. The pain of wounds will no longer exist, &amp;quot;God-with-them&amp;quot; will be their God! for the old order has ceased.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">He will wipe away every tear from their eyes</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">And God-Enthroned spoke to me and said, &amp;apos;Consider this! I am making everything to be new and fresh. Write down at once all that I have told you, because each word is trustworthy and dependable.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Then he said to me, &amp;apos;It has been accomplished! For I am the Aleph and the Tav, the beginning and the end. I will give water to all who are thirsty. As my gracious gift, they will continuously drink from the fountain of living water.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">The conquering ones will inherit these gifts from me. I will continue to be their God and they will continue being children for me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">But as for the cowardly, the faithless, the despicable, the murderers, the perverts, the sorcerers, the idolaters, and all deceivers, they will find their place in the lake of fire and sulfur, which is the second death.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Then one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls full of the last seven plagues came to me and said, &amp;apos;Come. I will show you the beautiful bride, the wife of the Lamb.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">He carried me away in the realm of the Spirit to the top of a great, high mountain. There he showed me the holy city, Jerusalem, descending out of heaven from God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">It was infused with the glory of God, and its radiance was like that of a very rare jewel, like a jasper, clear as crystal.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">It had a massive, high wall with twelve gates, and each gate had an angel. Each gate had written upon it a name of one of the twelve tribes of Israel&amp;ndash;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">three gates on the east, three gates on the north, three gates on the south, and three gates on the west.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">The city wall had twelve foundations, and on them were the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">The angel who spoke with me had a gold measuring rod to measure the city, its gates and walls.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">The city was laid out in a perfect square; its length, width, and height were equal. So he measured the city with his rod, and it was 12,000 stadia, with equal dimensions for its width, length, and height.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">He also measured the wall at 144 cubits, according to the measure of a man, which is angelic.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">The city was pure gold, clear as crystal, and its wall was made of jasper.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">The twelve foundations of the wall were adorned with every kind of precious stone&amp;ndash;the first was jasper, the second sapphire, the third agate, the fourth emerald,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">the fifth onyx, the sixth carnelian, the seventh chrysolite, the eighth beryl, the ninth topaz, the tenth chrysoprase, the eleventh turquoise, and the twelfth amethyst.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">The twelve gates are twelve pearls&amp;ndash;each gate made of one pearl. And the street of the city was pure gold, clear as crystal.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">I saw no temple in the city, for its temple is the Lord God, the Almighty, and the Lamb.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">The city has no need for the sun or moon to shine, for the glory of God is its light, and its lamp is the Lamb.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">The people will walk by its light and the kings of the earth will bring their wealth into it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">Its gates will never be shut by day&amp;ndash;standing always open&amp;ndash;because there is no night there.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">People will bring the glory and wealth of the nations into it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">Evil will not enter, nor anyone who does what is abhorrent or deceitful, but only those whose names are written in the Book of the Life of the Lamb.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="22">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Then the angel showed me the river of the water of life, flowing with water clear as crystal, continuously pouring out from the throne of God and of the Lamb.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">The river was flowing in the middle of the street of the city, and on either side of the river was the Tree of Life, with its twelve kinds of ripe fruit according to each month of the year . The leaves of the Tree of Life are for the healing of the nations.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">And every curse will be broken and no longer exist, for the throne of God and of the Lamb will be there in the city . His loving servants will serve him; And they will reign as kings forever and ever!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">they will always see his face, and his name will be on their foreheads.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Night will be no more. They will never need the light of the sun or a lamp, because the Lord God will shine on them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Then the angel said to me, &amp;apos;These words are entirely trustworthy and true, for the Lord, the God of the spirits of the prophets, has sent his angel to show his loving servants what must occur swiftly.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">&amp;apos;Behold, I come quickly! Wonderfully blessed is the one who carefully guards the words of the prophecy of this book!&amp;apos; I bring my reward with me to repay everyone according to their works. the First and the Last, the Beginning and the Completion.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">I, John, am the one who heard and saw these things, and when I heard and saw it all, I fell facedown to worship the messenger who showed me these things.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">But he said to me, &amp;apos;Don&amp;quot;t do it! I am but a fellow servant with you and your brothers, the prophets, and with those who cling to the words of this book. Worship God!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">And he said to me, &amp;apos;Don&amp;quot;t keep secret the prophetic words of this book, for the time is near.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Let the evildoers be at their worst and the morally filthy continue in their depravity&amp;ndash;yet the righteous will still do what is right, and the holy will still be holy.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">&amp;apos;Behold, I am coming quickly!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">I am the Aleph and the Tav,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Wonderfully blessed are those who wash their robes white so they can access the Tree of Life and enter the city of bliss by its open gates.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Those not permitted to enter are outside: the malicious hypocrites, the sexually immoral, sorcerers, murderers, idolaters, and every lover of lies.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">&amp;apos;I, Jesus, sent my angel to you to give you this testimony to share with the congregations. I am the bright Morning Star, both David&amp;quot;s spiritual root and his descendant.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">&amp;apos;Come,&amp;apos; says the Holy Spirit and the Bride in divine duet . Let everyone who hears this duet join them in saying, &amp;apos;Come.&amp;apos; Let everyone gripped with spiritual thirst say, &amp;apos;Come.&amp;apos; And let everyone who craves the gift of living water come and drink it freely. &amp;apos;Come.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">I testify to everyone who hears the prophetic words of this book: If anyone adds to them, God will add to him the plagues described in this book.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">And if anyone subtracts from the prophetic words of this book, God will remove his portion from the Tree of Life and in the holy city, which are described in this book.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">The one who testifies to these things says, &amp;apos;Yes, I am coming quickly.&amp;apos; Amen! Come, Lord Jesus!</VERS>
