			<VERS vnumber="2">The earth was barren,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">God said, &amp;apos;I command light to shine!&amp;apos; And light started shining.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">God looked at the light and saw that it was good. He separated light from darkness</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">and named the light &amp;apos;Day&amp;apos; and the darkness &amp;apos;Night.&amp;apos; Evening came, then morning&amp;ndash;that was the first day.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">God said, &amp;apos;I command a dome to separate the water above it from the water below it.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">And that's what happened. God made the dome</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">and named it &amp;apos;Sky.&amp;apos; Evening came, then morning&amp;ndash;that was the second day.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">God said, &amp;apos;I command the water under the sky to come together in one place, so there will be dry ground.&amp;apos; And that's what happened.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">God named the dry ground &amp;apos;Land,&amp;apos; and he named the water &amp;apos;Ocean.&amp;apos; God looked at what he had done and saw that it was good.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">God said, &amp;apos;I command the earth to produce all kinds of plants, including fruit trees and grain.&amp;apos; And that's what happened.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">The earth produced all kinds of vegetation. God looked at what he had done, and it was good.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Evening came, then morning&amp;ndash;that was the third day.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">God said, &amp;apos;I command lights to appear in the sky and to separate day from night and to show the time for seasons, special days, and years.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">I command them to shine on the earth.&amp;apos; And that's what happened.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">God made two powerful lights, the brighter one to rule the day and the other to rule the night. He also made the stars.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Then God put these lights in the sky to shine on the earth,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">to rule day and night, and to separate light from darkness. God looked at what he had done, and it was good.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Evening came, then morning&amp;ndash;that was the fourth day.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">God said, &amp;apos;I command the ocean to be full of living creatures, and I command birds to fly above the earth.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">So God made the giant sea monsters and all the living creatures that swim in the ocean. He also made every kind of bird. God looked at what he had done, and it was good.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Then he gave the living creatures his blessing&amp;ndash;he told the ocean creatures to increase and live everywhere in the ocean and the birds to increase everywhere on earth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">Evening came, then morning&amp;ndash;that was the fifth day.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="27">So God created humans to be like himself; he made men and women.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">God gave them his blessing and said:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">I have provided all kinds of fruit and grain for you to eat.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">And I have given the green plants as food for everything else that breathes, including animals, both wild and tame, and birds. And so it was.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">God looked at what he had done. All of it was very good! Evening came, then morning&amp;ndash;that was the sixth day.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="2">
			<VERS vnumber="1">So the heavens and the earth and everything else were created. When the Lord God made the heavens and the earth, None of these was the right kind of partner for the man. The Lord God brought her to the man, &amp;apos;Here is someone like me! She is part of my body, my own flesh and bones. She came from me, a man.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">By the seventh day God had finished his work, and so he rested.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">God blessed the seventh day and made it special, because on that day he rested from his work.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">That's how God created the heavens and the earth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">no grass or plants were growing anywhere. God had not yet sent any rain, and there was no one to work the land.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">But streams came up from the ground and watered the earth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">The Lord God took some soil from the ground and made a man. God breathed life into the man, and the man started breathing.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">The Lord made a garden in a place called Eden, which was in the east, and he put the man there.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">The Lord God filled the garden with all kinds of beautiful trees and fruit trees. Two other trees were in the middle of the garden. One of these gave life&amp;ndash;the other gave the wisdom to know the difference between right and wrong.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">From Eden a river flowed out to water the garden, then it divided into four rivers.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">The first one is the Pishon River that flows through the land of Havilah,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">where pure gold, rare perfumes, and precious stones are found.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">The second is the Gihon River that winds through Ethiopia.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">The Tigris River that flows east of Assyria is the third, and the fourth is the Euphrates River.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">The Lord God put the man in the Garden of Eden to take care of it and to look after it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">But the Lord told him, &amp;apos;You may eat fruit from any tree in the garden,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">except the one that has the power to let you know the difference between right and wrong. If you eat any fruit from that tree, you will die before the day is over!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">The Lord God said, &amp;apos;It isn't good for the man to live alone. I will make a suitable partner for him.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">So the Lord God made him fall into a deep sleep, and he took out one of the man's ribs. Then after closing the man's side,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">the Lord made a woman out of the rib.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">and the man exclaimed, So I will name her Woman!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">That's why a man will leave his own father and mother. He marries a woman, and the two of them become like one person.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">Although the man and his wife were both naked, they were not ashamed.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="3">
			<VERS vnumber="1">The snake was sneakier than any of the other wild animals that the Lord God had made. One day it came to the woman and asked, &amp;apos;Did God tell you not to eat fruit from any tree in the garden?&amp;apos; &amp;apos;The snake tricked me,&amp;apos; she answered, &amp;apos;and I ate some of that fruit.&amp;apos; &amp;apos;Because of what you have done, you will be the only animal to suffer this curse&amp;ndash; For as long as you live, you will crawl on your stomach and eat dirt. will hate each other; your descendants and hers will always be enemies. One of hers will strike you on the head, and you will strike him on the heel.&amp;apos; &amp;apos;You will suffer terribly when you give birth. But you will still desire your husband, and he will rule over you.&amp;apos; &amp;apos;You listened to your wife and ate the fruit I told you not to eat. And so, the ground will be under a curse because of what you did. As long as you live, you will have to struggle to grow enough food. but the ground will produce thorns and thistles. to earn a living; you were made out of soil, and you will once again turn into soil.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">The woman answered, &amp;apos;God said we could eat fruit from any tree in the garden,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">except the one in the middle. He told us not to eat fruit from that tree or even to touch it. If we do, we will die.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">&amp;apos;No, you won't!&amp;apos; the snake replied.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">&amp;apos;God understands what will happen on the day you eat fruit from that tree. You will see what you have done, and you will know the difference between right and wrong, just as God does.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">The woman stared at the fruit. It looked beautiful and tasty. She wanted the wisdom that it would give her, and she ate some of the fruit. Her husband was there with her, so she gave some to him, and he ate it too.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">At once they saw what they had done, and they realized they were naked. Then they sewed fig leaves together to cover themselves.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Late in the afternoon, when the breeze began to blow, the man and woman heard the Lord God walking in the garden. So they hid behind some trees.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">The Lord God called out to the man and asked, &amp;apos;Where are you?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">The man answered, &amp;apos;I was naked, and when I heard you walking through the garden, I was frightened and hid!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">&amp;apos;How did you know you were naked?&amp;apos; God asked. &amp;apos;Did you eat any fruit from that tree in the middle of the garden?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">&amp;apos;It was the woman you put here with me,&amp;apos; the man said. &amp;apos;She gave me some of the fruit, and I ate it.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">The Lord God then asked the woman, &amp;apos;What have you done?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">So the Lord God said to the snake:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">You and this woman</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Then the Lord God said to the woman,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">The Lord said to the man,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Your food will be plants,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">You will sweat all your life</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">The man Adam named his wife Eve because she would become the mother of all who live.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Then the Lord God made clothes out of animal skins for the man and his wife.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">The Lord said, &amp;apos;They now know the difference between right and wrong, just as we do. But they must not be allowed to eat fruit from the tree that lets them live forever.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">So the Lord God sent them out of the Garden of Eden, where they would have to work the ground from which the man had been made.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">Then God put winged creatures at the entrance to the garden and a flaming, flashing sword to guard the way to the life-giving tree.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="4">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Adam and Eve had a son. Then Eve said, &amp;apos;I'll name him Cain because I got him with the help of the Lord .&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Later she had another son and named him Abel. Abel became a sheep farmer, but Cain farmed the land. What's wrong with you? Why do you look so angry? &amp;apos;How should I know?&amp;apos; he answered. &amp;apos;Am I supposed to look after my brother?&amp;apos; Why have you done this terrible thing? You killed your own brother, and his blood flowed onto the ground. Now his blood is calling out for me to punish you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">One day, Cain gave part of his harvest to the Lord ,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">and Abel also gave an offering to the Lord . He killed the first-born lamb from one of his sheep and gave the Lord the best parts of it. The Lord was pleased with Abel and his offering,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">but not with Cain and his offering. This made Cain so angry that he could not hide his feelings.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">The Lord said to Cain:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">If you had done the right thing, you would be smiling. But you did the wrong thing, and now sin is waiting to attack you like a lion. Sin wants to destroy you, but don't let it!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Cain said to his brother Abel, &amp;apos;Let's go for a walk.&amp;apos; And when they were out in a field, Cain attacked and killed him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Afterwards the Lord asked Cain, &amp;apos;Where is Abel?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Then the Lord said:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">And so, I'll put you under a curse. Because you killed Abel and made his blood run out on the ground, you will never be able to farm it again.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">When you try to farm the land, it won't produce anything for you. From now on, you'll be without a home, and you'll spend the rest of your life wandering from place to place.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">&amp;apos;This punishment is too hard!&amp;apos; Cain said.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">&amp;apos;You're making me leave my home and live far from you. I will have to wander about without a home, and just anyone could kill me.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">&amp;apos;No!&amp;apos; the Lord answered. &amp;apos;Anyone who kills you will be punished seven times worse than I am punishing you.&amp;apos; So the Lord put a mark on Cain to warn everyone not to kill him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">But Cain had to go far from the Lord and live in the Land of Wandering, which is east of Eden.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Later, Cain and his wife had a son named Enoch. At the time Cain was building a town, and so he named it Enoch after his son.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Then Enoch had a son named Irad, who had a son named Mehujael, who had a son named Methushael, who had a son named Lamech.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Lamech married Adah, then Zillah.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Lamech and Zillah had a son named Tubal Cain who made tools out of bronze and iron. They also had a daughter, whose name was Naamah.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">One day, Lamech said to his two wives, &amp;apos;A young man wounded me, and I killed him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">Anyone who tries to get even with me will be punished ten times more than anyone who tries to get even with Cain.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">Adam and his wife had another son. They named him Seth, because they said, &amp;apos;God has given us a son to take the place of Abel, who was killed by his brother Cain.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">Later, Seth had a son and named him Enosh. About this time people started worshiping the Lord .</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="21">When Enoch was 65, he had a son named Methuselah,</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="30">Lamech had more children</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">and died at the age of 777.</VERS>

		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="6">
			<VERS vnumber="3">Then the Lord said, &amp;apos;I won't let my life-giving breath remain in anyone forever. No one will live for more than 120 years.&amp;apos; Cruelty and violence have spread everywhere. Now I'm going to destroy the whole earth and all its people.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">The children of the supernatural beings who had married these women became famous heroes and warriors. They were called Nephilim and lived on the earth at that time and even later.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">The Lord saw how bad the people on earth were and that everything they thought and planned was evil.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">He was sorry that he had made them,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">and he said, &amp;apos;I'm going to destroy every person on earth! I'll even wipe out animals, birds, and reptiles. I'm sorry I ever made them.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">But the Lord was pleased with Noah,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">and this is the story about him. Noah was the only person who lived right and obeyed God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">He had three sons: Shem, Ham, and Japheth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">So he told Noah:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Get some good lumber and build a boat. Put rooms in it and cover it with tar inside and out.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Make it 133 meters long, 22 meters wide, and 13 meters high.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Build a roof on the boat and leave a space of about 44 centimeters between the roof and the sides. Make the boat three stories high and put a door on one side.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">I'm going to send a flood that will destroy everything that breathes! Nothing will be left alive.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">But I solemnly promise that you, your wife, your sons, and your daughters-in-law will be kept safe in the boat.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Store up enough food both for yourself and for them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Noah did everything God told him to do.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="7">
			<VERS vnumber="1">The Lord told Noah: Take your whole family with you into the boat, because you are the only one on this earth who pleases me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Take seven pairs of every kind of animal that can be used for sacrifice and one pair of all others.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Also take seven pairs of every kind of bird with you. Do this so there will always be animals and birds on the earth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Seven days from now I will send rain that will last for 40 days and nights, and I will destroy all other living creatures I have made.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Seven days later a flood began to cover the earth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">On that day Noah and his wife went into the boat with their three sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth, and their wives.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">They took along every kind of animal, tame and wild, including the birds.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Noah took a male and a female of every living creature with him,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">just as God had told him to do. And when they were all in the boat, the Lord closed the door.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Not a bird, animal, reptile, or human was left alive anywhere on earth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">A hundred fifty days later, the water started going down.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="8">
			<VERS vnumber="1">God did not forget about Noah and the animals with him in the boat. So God made a wind blow, and the water started going down.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">God stopped up the places where the water had been gushing out from under the earth. He also closed up the sky, and the rain stopped.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">For 150 days the water slowly went down.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Then on the seventeenth day of the seventh month of the year, the boat came to rest somewhere in the Ararat mountains.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">The water kept going down, and the mountain tops could be seen on the first day of the tenth month. Never again will I punish the earth for the sinful things its people do. All of them have evil thoughts from the time they are young, but I will never destroy everything that breathes, as I did this time. there will be planting and harvest, cold and heat; winter and summer, day and night.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Noah wanted to find out if the water had gone down, so he sent out a dove.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Deep water was still everywhere, and when the dove could not find a place to land, it flew back to the boat. Then Noah held out his hand and helped it back in.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Seven days later Noah sent the dove out again.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">It returned in the evening, holding in its beak a green leaf from an olive tree. Noah knew the water was finally going down.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">He waited seven more days before sending the dove out again, and this time it did not return.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Noah was now 601 years old. And by the first day of that year, almost all the water had gone away. Noah made an opening in the roof of the boat and saw that the ground was getting dry.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">By the twenty-seventh day of the second month, the earth was completely dry.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">God said to Noah,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">&amp;apos;You, your wife, your sons, and your daughters-in-law may now leave the boat.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Let out the birds, animals, and reptiles, so they can mate and live all over the earth.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">After Noah and his family had left the boat,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">the living creatures left in groups of their own kind.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Noah built an altar where he could offer sacrifices to the Lord . Then he offered on the altar one of each kind of animal and bird that could be used for a sacrifice.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">The smell of the burning offering pleased the Lord , and he said:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">As long as the earth remains,</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="9">
			<VERS vnumber="1">God said to Noah and his sons: I am giving you my blessing. Have a lot of children and grandchildren, so people will live everywhere on this earth. &amp;apos;I now put a curse on Canaan! He will be the lowest slave of his brothers. to bless Shem and make Canaan his slave. and let him take over the territory of Shem. May Canaan be his slave.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">All animals, birds, reptiles, and fish will be afraid of you. I have placed them under your control,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">and I have given them to you for food. From now on, you may eat them, as well as the green plants that you have always eaten.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">But life is in the blood, and you must not eat any meat that still has blood in it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">I want you and your descendants to have many children, so people will live everywhere on earth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Again, God said to Noah and his sons:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">I am going to make a solemn promise to you and to everyone who will live after you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">This includes the birds and the animals that came out of the boat.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">I promise every living creature that the earth and those living on it will never again be destroyed by a flood.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">When I send clouds over the earth, and a rainbow appears in the sky,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">I will remember my promise to you and to all other living creatures. Never again will I let floodwaters destroy all life.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">When I see the rainbow in the sky, I will always remember the promise that I have made to every living creature.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">The rainbow will be the sign of that solemn promise.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Noah and his sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth, left the boat. Ham later had a son named Canaan.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">All people on earth are descendants of Noah's three sons.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Noah farmed the land and was the first to plant a vineyard.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">One day he got drunk and was lying naked in his tent.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Ham entered the tent and saw him naked, then went back outside and told his brothers.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">Shem and Japheth put a robe over their shoulders and walked backwards into the tent. Without looking at their father, they placed it over his body.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">When Noah sobered up and learned what his youngest son had done,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">he said,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">I ask the Lord my God</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">I pray God will give Japheth more and more land</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">Noah lived 350 years after the flood</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">and died at the age of 950.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="10">
			<VERS vnumber="1">After the flood Shem, Ham, and Japheth had many descendants. Gomer was the ancestor of Ashkenaz, Riphath, and Togarmah. Raamah was the ancestor of Sheba and Dedan. Canaan's sons were Sidon and Heth. Canaan was also the ancestor of the Jebusites, the Amorites, the Girgashites, the Hivites, the Arkites, the Sinites, the Arvadites, the Zemarites, and the Hamathites. Later the Canaanites spread from the territory of Sidon and settled as far away as Gaza in the direction of Gerar. They also went as far as Lasha in the direction of Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah, and Zeboiim. Shem was the ancestor of Elam, Asshur, Arpachshad, Lud, and Aram. Aram was the ancestor of Uz, Hul, Gether, and Mash. Joktan was the ancestor of Almodad, Sheleph, Hazarmaveth, Jerah, Hadoram, Uzal, Diklah, Obal, Abimael, Sheba, Ophir, Havilah, and Jobab. Their land reached from Mesha in the direction of Sephar, the hill country in the east.</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="12">
			<VERS vnumber="1">The Lord said to Abram: Leave your country, your family, and your relatives and go to the land that I will show you. When they came to the land of Canaan,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">I will bless you and make your descendants into a great nation. You will become famous and be a blessing to others.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">I will bless those who bless you, but I will put a curse on anyone who puts a curse on you. Everyone on earth will be blessed because of you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Abram went as far as the sacred tree of Moreh in a place called Shechem. The Canaanites were still living in the land at that time,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">but the Lord appeared to Abram and promised, &amp;apos;I will give this land to your family forever.&amp;apos; Abram then built an altar there for the Lord .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Abram traveled to the hill country east of Bethel and camped between Bethel and Ai, where he built another altar and worshiped the Lord .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Later, Abram started out toward the Southern Desert.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">When the Egyptians see you, they will murder me because I am your husband. But they won't kill you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Please save my life by saying you are my sister.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">As soon as Abram and Sarai arrived in Egypt, the Egyptians noticed how beautiful she was.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">The king's officials told him about her, and she was taken to his house.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">The king was good to Abram because of Sarai, and Abram was given sheep, cattle, donkeys, slaves, and camels.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Because of Sarai, the Lord struck the king and everyone in his palace with terrible diseases.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Finally, the king sent for Abram and said to him, &amp;apos;What have you done to me? Why didn't you tell me Sarai was your wife?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Why did you make me believe she was your sister? Now I've married her. Take her and go! She's your wife.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">So the king told his men to let Abram and Sarai take their possessions and leave.</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="13">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Abram and Sarai took everything they owned and went to the Southern Desert. Lot went with them. Look around to the north, south, east, and west.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Abram was very rich. He owned many cattle, sheep, and goats, and had a lot of silver and gold.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Abram moved from place to place in the Southern Desert. And finally, he went north and set up his tents between Bethel and Ai,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">where he had earlier camped and built an altar. There he worshiped the Lord .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Lot, who was traveling with him, also had sheep, goats, and cattle, as well as his own family and slaves.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Abram said to Lot, &amp;apos;We are close relatives. We shouldn't argue, and our men shouldn't be fighting one another.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">There is plenty of land for you to choose from. Let's separate. If you go north, I'll go south; if you go south, I'll go north.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">This happened before the Lord had destroyed the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah. And when Lot looked around, he saw there was plenty of water in the Jordan Valley. All the way to Zoar the valley was as green as the garden of the Lord or the land of Egypt.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">So Lot chose the whole Jordan Valley for himself, and as he started out toward the east, he and Abram separated.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Abram stayed in the land of Canaan. But Lot settled near the cities of the valley and put up his tents not far from Sodom,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">where the people were evil and sinned terribly against the Lord .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">After Abram and Lot had gone their separate ways, the Lord said to Abram:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">I will give you and your family all the land you can see. It will be theirs forever!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">I will give you more descendants than there are specks of dust on the earth, and someday it will be easier to count those specks of dust than to count your descendants.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Now walk back and forth across the land, because I am going to give it to you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Abram took down his tents and went to live near the sacred trees of Mamre at Hebron, where he built an altar in honor of the Lord .</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1">About this time, King Amraphel of Babylonia, King Arioch of Ellasar, King Chedorlaomer of Elam, and King Tidal of Goiim</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">attacked King Bera of Sodom, King Birsha of Gomorrah, King Shinab of Admah, King Shemeber of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela, a city also known as Zoar.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">A year later King Chedorlaomer and his allies attacked and defeated the Rephaites in Ashteroth-Karnaim, the Zuzites in Ham, and the Emites in Shaveh-Kiriathaim.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">They also defeated the Horites in the hill country of Edom, as far as El-Paran, near the desert.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">They went back to the city of Enmishpat, better known as Kadesh. Then they captured all the land that belonged to the Amalekites, and they defeated the Amorites who were living in Hazazon-Tamar.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="11">Their enemies took everything of value from Sodom and Gomorrah, including their food supplies.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">They also captured Abram's nephew Lot, who lived in Sodom. They took him and his possessions and then left.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">At this time Abram the Hebrew was living near the oaks that belonged to Mamre the Amorite. Mamre and his brothers Eshcol and Aner were Abram's friends. Someone who had escaped from the battle told Abram</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">that his nephew Lot had been taken away. Three hundred and eighteen of Abram's servants were fighting men, so he took them and followed the enemy as far north as the city of Dan.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">That night, Abram divided up his troops, attacked from all sides, and won a great victory. But some of the enemy escaped to the town of Hobah north of Damascus,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">and Abram went after them. He brought back his nephew Lot, together with Lot's possessions and the women and everyone else who had been captured.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Abram returned after he had defeated King Chedorlaomer and the other kings. Then the king of Sodom went to meet Abram in Shaveh Valley, which is also known as King's Valley.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">King Melchizedek of Salem was a priest of God Most High. He brought out some bread and wine</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">and said to Abram:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">All praise belongs</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">The king of Sodom said to Abram, &amp;apos;All I want are my people. You can keep everything else.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Abram answered:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">that I won't keep anything of yours, not even a sandal strap or a piece of thread. Then you can never say that you are the one who made me rich.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">Let my share be the food that my men have eaten. But Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre went with me, so give them their share of what we brought back.</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="15">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Later the Lord spoke to Abram in a vision, &amp;apos;Abram, don't be afraid! I will protect you and reward you greatly.&amp;apos; Abram, you will live to an old age and die in peace. But I solemnly promise that your descendants will live as foreigners in a land that doesn't belong to them. They will be forced into slavery and abused for 400 years. But I will terribly punish the nation that enslaves them, and they will leave with many possessions.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">But Abram answered, &amp;apos; Lord All-Powerful, you have given me everything I could ask for, except children. And when I die, Eliezer of Damascus will get all I own.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">You have not given me any children, and this servant of mine will inherit everything.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">The Lord replied, &amp;apos;No, he won't! You will have a son of your own, and everything you have will be his.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Then the Lord took Abram outside and said, &amp;apos;Look at the sky and see if you can count the stars. That's how many descendants you will have.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Abram believed the Lord , so the Lord was pleased with him and accepted him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">The Lord said to Abram, &amp;apos;I brought you here from Ur in Chaldea, and I gave you this land.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Abram asked, &amp;apos; Lord God, how can I know the land will be mine?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Then the Lord told him, &amp;apos;Bring me a three-year-old cow, a three-year-old female goat, a three-year-old ram, a dove, and a young pigeon.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Abram obeyed the Lord . Then he cut the animals in half and laid the two halves of each animal opposite each other on the ground. But he did not cut the doves and pigeons in half.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">And when birds came down to eat the animals, Abram chased them away.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">As the sun was setting, Abram fell into a deep sleep, and everything became dark and frightening.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Four generations later, your descendants will return here and take this land, because only then will the people who live here be so sinful that they deserve to be punished.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Sometime after sunset, when it was very dark, a smoking cooking pot and a flaming fire passed between the two halves of each animal.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">At that time the Lord made an agreement with Abram and told him: I will give your descendants the land east of the Shihor River on the border of Egypt as far as the Euphrates River.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1">Abram's wife Sarai had not been able to have any children. But she owned a young Egyptian slave woman named Hagar,</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="3">and Sarai gave him Hagar to be his wife. This happened after Abram had lived in the land of Canaan for ten years.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Later, when Hagar knew she was going to have a baby, she became proud and treated Sarai hatefully. She answered, &amp;apos;I'm running away from Sarai, my owner.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Then Sarai said to Abram, &amp;apos;It's all your fault! I gave you my slave woman, but she has been hateful to me ever since she found out she was pregnant. You have done me wrong, and you will have to answer to the Lord for this.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Abram said, &amp;apos;All right! She's your slave&amp;ndash;do whatever you want with her.&amp;apos; Then Sarai began treating Hagar so harshly that she finally ran away.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Hagar stopped to rest at a spring in the desert on the road to Shur. While she was there, the angel of the Lord came to her</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="12">But your son will live far from his relatives; he will be like a wild donkey, fighting everyone, and everyone fighting him.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Hagar thought, &amp;apos;Have I really seen God and lived to tell about it?&amp;apos; So from then on she called him, &amp;apos;The God Who Sees Me.&amp;apos;</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1">When Abram was 99 years old, the Lord appeared to him again and said, &amp;apos;I am God All-Powerful. If you obey me and always do right,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">I will keep my solemn promise to you and give you more descendants than can be counted.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Abram bowed with his face to the ground, and God said:</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="17">Abraham bowed with his face to the ground and thought, &amp;apos;I am almost 100 years old. How can I become a father? And Sarah is 90. How can she have a child?&amp;apos; So he started laughing.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Then he asked God, &amp;apos;Why not let Ishmael inherit what you have promised me?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">But God answered: No! You and Sarah will have a son. His name will be Isaac, and I will make an everlasting promise to him and his descendants.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1">One hot summer afternoon while Abraham was sitting by the entrance to his tent near the sacred trees of Mamre, the Lord appeared to him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Abraham looked up and saw three men standing nearby. He quickly ran to meet them, bowed with his face to the ground,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">and said, &amp;apos;Please come to my home where I can serve you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">I'll have some water brought, so you can wash your feet, then you can rest under a tree.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Let me get you some food to give you strength before you leave. I would be honored to serve you.&amp;apos; &amp;apos;Thank you very much,&amp;apos; they answered. &amp;apos;We accept your offer.&amp;apos; While they were eating, he stood near them under the tree, &amp;apos;She is right there in the tent,&amp;apos; Abraham answered. Sarah was behind Abraham, listening at the entrance to the tent. &amp;apos;Yes, you did!&amp;apos; he answered. &amp;apos;If I find 45 good people,&amp;apos; the Lord replied, &amp;apos;I won't destroy the city.&amp;apos; &amp;apos;Even for them,&amp;apos; the Lord replied, &amp;apos;I won't destroy the city.&amp;apos; &amp;apos;If I find 30,&amp;apos; the Lord replied, &amp;apos;I still won't destroy it.&amp;apos; &amp;apos;Because of them, I won't destroy the city,&amp;apos; was the Lord 's answer. &amp;apos;For the sake of 10 good people,&amp;apos; the Lord told him, &amp;apos;I still won't destroy the city.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Abraham went quickly to his tent and said to Sarah, &amp;apos;Hurry! Get a large sack of flour and make some bread.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">After saying this, he rushed off to his herd of cattle and picked out one of the best calves, which his servant quickly prepared.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">He then served his guests some yogurt and milk together with the meat.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">and they asked, &amp;apos;Where's your wife Sarah?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">One of the guests was the Lord , and he said, &amp;apos;I'll come back about this time next year, and when I do, Sarah will already have a son.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Abraham and Sarah were very old, and Sarah was well past the age for having children.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">So she laughed and said to herself, &amp;apos;Now that I am worn out and my husband is old, will I really know such happiness?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">The Lord asked Abraham, &amp;apos;Why did Sarah laugh? Does she doubt that she can have a child in her old age?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">I am the Lord ! There is nothing too difficult for me. I'll come back next year at the time I promised, and Sarah will already have a son.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Sarah was so frightened that she lied and said, &amp;apos;I didn't laugh.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">When the three men got ready to leave, they looked down toward Sodom, and Abraham walked part of the way with them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">The Lord said to himself, &amp;apos;I should tell Abraham what I am going to do,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">since his family will become a great and powerful nation that will be a blessing to all the other nations on earth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">I have chosen him to teach his family to obey me forever and to do what is right and fair. If they do, I will give Abraham many descendants, just as I promised.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">The Lord said, &amp;apos;Abraham, I have heard that the people of Sodom and Gomorrah are doing all kinds of evil things.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Now I am going down to see for myself if those people really are that bad. If they aren't, I would like to know.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">The men turned and started toward Sodom. But the Lord stayed with Abraham.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">And Abraham asked him, &amp;apos; Lord , when you destroy the evil people, are you also going to destroy those who are good?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">Wouldn't you spare the city if there are only 50 good people in it?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">You surely wouldn't let them be killed when you destroy the evil ones. You are the judge of all the earth, and you do what is right.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">The Lord replied, &amp;apos;If I find 50 good people in Sodom, I will save the city to keep them from being killed.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">Abraham answered, &amp;apos;I am nothing more than the dust of the earth. Please forgive me, Lord , for daring to speak to you like this.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">But suppose there are only 45 good people in Sodom. Would you still wipe out the whole city?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">&amp;apos;Suppose there are just 40 good people?&amp;apos; Abraham asked.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">Abraham said, &amp;apos;Please don't be angry, Lord , if I ask you what you will do if there are only 30 good people in the city.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">Then Abraham said, &amp;apos;I don't have any right to ask you, Lord , but what would you do if you find only 20?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">Finally, Abraham said, &amp;apos;Please don't get angry, Lord , if I speak just once more. Suppose you find only 10 good people there.&amp;apos;</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="19">
			<VERS vnumber="1">That evening, while Lot was sitting near the city gate, the two angels arrived in Sodom. When Lot saw them, he got up, bowed down low,</VERS>

You can wash your feet, spend the night, and be on your way in the morning.&amp;apos; They told him, &amp;apos;No, we'll spend the night in the city square.&amp;apos; The crowd kept arguing with Lot. Finally, they rushed toward the door to break it down.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">But Lot kept insisting, until they finally agreed and went home with him. He quickly baked some bread, cooked a meal, and they ate.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Before Lot and his guests could go to bed, every man in Sodom, young and old, came and stood outside his house</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">and started shouting, &amp;apos;Where are your visitors? Send them out, so we can have sex with them!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Lot went outside and shut the door behind him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Then he said, &amp;apos;Friends, please don't do such a terrible thing!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">I have two daughters who have never had sex. I'll bring them out, and you can do what you want with them. But don't harm these men. They are guests in my home.&amp;apos;</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="10">But the two angels in the house reached out and pulled Lot safely inside.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Then they struck blind everyone in the crowd, and none of them could even find the door.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Lot went to the men who were engaged to his daughters and said, &amp;apos;Hurry up and get out of here! The Lord is going to destroy this city.&amp;apos; But they thought he was joking, and they laughed at him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Early the next morning the two angels tried to make Lot hurry and leave. They said, &amp;apos;Take your wife and your two daughters and get away from here as fast as you can! If you don't, every one of you will be killed when the Lord destroys the city.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">At first, Lot just stood there. But the Lord wanted to save him. So the angels took Lot, his wife, and his two daughters by the hand and led them out of the city.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">When they were outside, one of the angels said, &amp;apos;Run for your lives! Don't even look back. And don't stop in the valley. Run to the hills, where you'll be safe.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">There's a town near here. It's only a small place, but my family and I will be safe, if you let us go there.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">&amp;apos;All right, go there,&amp;apos; he answered. &amp;apos;I won't destroy that town.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Hurry! Run! I can't do anything until you are safely there.&amp;apos; The town was later called Zoar because Lot had said it was small.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">The sun was coming up as Lot reached the town of Zoar,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">and the Lord sent burning sulfur down like rain on Sodom and Gomorrah.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">He destroyed those cities and everyone who lived in them, as well as their land and the trees and grass that grew there.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">On the way, Lot's wife looked back and was turned into a block of salt.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">That same morning Abraham got up and went to the place where he had stood and spoken with the Lord .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">He looked down toward Sodom and Gomorrah and saw smoke rising from all over the land&amp;ndash;it was like a flaming furnace.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">When God destroyed the cities of the valley where Lot lived, he remembered his promise to Abraham and saved Lot from the terrible destruction.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">Lot was afraid to stay on in Zoar. So he took his two daughters and moved to a cave in the hill country.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">One day his older daughter said to her sister, &amp;apos;Our father is old, and there are no men anywhere for us to marry.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">Let's get our father drunk! Then we can sleep with him and have children.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">That night they got their father drunk, and the older daughter got in bed with him, but he was too drunk even to know she was there.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">The next day the older daughter said to her sister, &amp;apos;I slept with my father last night. We'll get him drunk again tonight, so you can sleep with him, and we can each have a child.&amp;apos;</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1">Abraham moved to the Southern Desert, where he settled between Kadesh and Shur. Later he went to Gerar, and while there</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">he told everyone that his wife Sarah was his sister. So King Abimelech of Gerar had Sarah brought to him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">But God came to Abimelech in a dream and said, &amp;apos;You have taken a married woman into your home, and for this you will die!&amp;apos; I know you are innocent. That's why I kept you from sleeping with Sarah and doing anything wrong. Look what you've done to us! What have I ever done to you? Why did you make me and my nation guilty of such a terrible sin? I did it because I didn't think any of you respected God, and I was sure that someone would kill me to get my wife.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Then God continued:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Her husband is a prophet. Let her go back to him, and his prayers will save you from death. But if you don't return her, you and all your people will die.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Early the next morning Abimelech sent for his officials, and when he told them what had happened, they were frightened.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Abimelech then called in Abraham and said:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">What were you thinking when you did this?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Abraham answered:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Besides, she is my half sister. We have the same father, but different mothers.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">When God made us leave my father's home and start wandering, I told her, &amp;apos;If you really love me, then tell everyone that I am your brother.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">After Abimelech had given Abraham some sheep, cattle, and slaves, he sent Sarah back</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">and told Abraham he could settle anywhere in his country.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Then he said to Sarah, &amp;apos;I have given your brother 1,000 pieces of silver as proof to everyone that you have done nothing wrong.&amp;apos;</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="21">
			<VERS vnumber="1">The Lord was good to Sarah and kept his promise.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Although Abraham was very old, Sarah had a son exactly at the time God had said.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Abraham named his son Isaac,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">and when the boy was eight days old, Abraham circumcised him, just as God had commanded. They wandered around in the desert near Beersheba,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Abraham was 100 years old when Isaac was born,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">and Sarah said, &amp;apos;God has made me laugh. And now everyone will laugh with me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Who would have dared to tell Abraham that someday I would have a child? But in his old age, I have given him a son.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">The time came when Sarah no longer had to nurse Isaac, and on that day Abraham gave a big feast.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Abraham was worried about Ishmael.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">But God said, &amp;apos;Abraham, don't worry about your slave woman and the boy. Just do what Sarah tells you. Isaac will inherit your family name,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">but the son of the slave woman is also your son, and I will make his descendants into a great nation.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Early the next morning Abraham gave Hagar an animal skin full of water and some bread. Then he put the boy on her shoulder and sent them away.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">and after they had run out of water, Hagar put her son under a bush.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Then she sat down a long way off, because she could not bear to watch him die. And she cried bitterly.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">When God heard the boy crying, the angel of God called out to Hagar from heaven and said, &amp;apos;Hagar, why are you worried? Don't be afraid. I have heard your son crying.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Help him up and hold his hand, because I will make him the father of a great nation.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Then God let her see a well. So she went to the well and filled the skin with water, then gave some to her son.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">About this time Abimelech and his army commander Phicol said to Abraham, &amp;apos;God blesses everything you do!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">Now I want you to promise in the name of God that you will always be loyal to me and my descendants, just as I have always been loyal to you in this land where you have lived as a foreigner.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">And so, Abraham promised he would.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">One day, Abraham told Abimelech, &amp;apos;Some of your servants have taken over one of my wells.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">&amp;apos;This is the first I've heard about it,&amp;apos; Abimelech replied. &amp;apos;Why haven't you said something before? I don't have any idea who did it.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">Abraham gave Abimelech some sheep and cattle, then the two men made a peace treaty.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">Abraham separated seven female lambs from his flock of sheep,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">and Abimelech asked, &amp;apos;Why have you done this?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">Abraham replied, &amp;apos;I want you to accept these seven lambs as proof that I dug this well.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">So they called the place Beersheba, because they made a treaty there.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">When the treaty was completed, Abimelech and his army commander Phicol went back to the land of the Philistines.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">Abraham planted a tamarisk tree in Beersheba and worshiped the eternal Lord God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">Then Abraham lived a long time as a foreigner in the land of the Philistines.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="22">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Some years later God decided to test Abraham, so he spoke to him. Abraham answered, &amp;apos;Here I am, Lord .&amp;apos; &amp;apos;My son,&amp;apos; Abraham answered, &amp;apos;God will provide the lamb.&amp;apos; The two of them walked on, and &amp;apos;Here I am!&amp;apos; he answered.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">The Lord said, &amp;apos;Go get Isaac, your only son, the one you dearly love! Take him to the land of Moriah, and I will show you a mountain where you must sacrifice him to me on the fires of an altar.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">So Abraham got up early the next morning and chopped wood for the fire. He put a saddle on his donkey and set out with Isaac and two servants for the place where God had told him to go.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Three days later Abraham looked off in the distance and saw the place.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">He told his servants, &amp;apos;Stay here with the donkey, while my son and I go over there to worship. We will come back.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Abraham put the wood on Isaac's shoulder, but he carried the hot coals and the knife. As the two of them walked along,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">when they reached the place that God had told him about, Abraham built an altar and placed the wood on it. Next, he tied up his son and put him on the wood.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">He then took the knife and got ready to kill his son.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">But the Lord 's angel shouted from heaven, &amp;apos;Abraham! Abraham!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">&amp;apos;Don't hurt the boy or harm him in any way!&amp;apos; the angel said. &amp;apos;Now I know that you truly obey God, because you were willing to offer him your only son.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Abraham looked up and saw a ram caught by its horns in the bushes. So he took the ram and sacrificed it instead of his son.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Abraham named that place &amp;apos;The Lord Will Provide.&amp;apos; And even now people say, &amp;apos;On the mountain of the Lord it will be provided.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">The Lord 's angel called out from heaven a second time:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">You were willing to offer your only son to the Lord , and so he makes you this solemn promise,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">&amp;apos;I will bless you and give you such a large family, that someday your descendants will be more numerous than the stars in the sky or the grains of sand along the seashore. They will defeat their enemies and take over the cities where their enemies live.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">You have obeyed me, and so you and your descendants will be a blessing to all nations on earth.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Abraham and Isaac went back to the servants who had come with him, and they returned to Abraham's home in Beersheba.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">Nahor also had another wife. Her name was Reumah, and she had four sons: Tebah, Gaham, Tahash, and Maacah.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="23">
			<VERS vnumber="3">he went to the Hittites and said,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">&amp;apos;I live as a foreigner in your land, and I don't own any property where I can bury my wife. Please let me buy a piece of land.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Abraham bowed down</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">and replied, &amp;apos;If you are willing to let me bury my wife here, please ask Zohar's son Ephron</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">to sell me Machpelah Cave at the end of his field. I'll pay what it's worth, and all of you can be witnesses.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Ephron was sitting there near the city gate, when Abraham made this request, and he answered,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">&amp;apos;Sir, the whole field, including the cave, is yours. With my own people as witnesses, I freely give it to you as a burial place for your dead.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Once again, Abraham bowed down</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">and said to Ephron, &amp;apos;In front of these witnesses, I offer you the full price, so I can bury my wife. Please accept my offer.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">So Abraham buried his wife Sarah in Machpelah Cave that was in the field</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">he had bought from the Hittites.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="24">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Abraham was now a very old man. The Lord had made him rich, and he was successful in everything he did.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">One day, Abraham called in his most trusted servant and said to him, &amp;apos;Solemnly promise me</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">in the name of the Lord , who rules heaven and earth, that you won't choose a wife for my son Isaac from the people here in the land of Canaan.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Instead, go back to the land where I was born and find a wife for him from among my relatives.&amp;apos; You, Lord , are the God my master Abraham worships. Please keep your promise to him and let me find a wife for Isaac today. &amp;apos;Go ahead and tell us,&amp;apos; Laban answered. I am Abraham's servant. &amp;apos;Yes,&amp;apos; she answered.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">But the servant asked, &amp;apos;What if the young woman I choose refuses to leave home and come here with me? Should I send Isaac there to look for a wife?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">&amp;apos;No!&amp;apos; Abraham answered. &amp;apos;Don't ever do that, no matter what.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">The Lord who rules heaven brought me here from the land where I was born and promised that he would give this land to my descendants forever. When you go back there, the Lord will send his angel ahead of you to help you find a wife for my son.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">If the woman refuses to come along, you don't have to keep this promise. But don't ever take my son back there.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">So the servant gave Abraham his word that he would do everything he had been told to do.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Soon after that, the servant loaded ten of Abraham's camels with valuable gifts. Then he set out for the city in northern Syria, where Abraham's brother Nahor lived.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">When he got there, he let the camels rest near the well outside the city. It was late afternoon, the time when the women came out for water.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">The servant prayed:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">The young women of the city will soon come to this well for water,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">and I'll ask one of them for a drink. If she gives me a drink and then offers to get some water for my camels, I'll know she is the one you have chosen and that you have kept your promise to my master.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Abraham's servant ran to her and said, &amp;apos;Please let me have a drink of water.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">&amp;apos;I'll be glad to,&amp;apos; she answered. Then she quickly took the jar from her shoulder and held it while he drank.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Abraham's servant did not say a word, but he watched everything Rebekah did, because he wanted to know for certain if this was the woman the Lord had chosen.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">The servant had brought along an expensive gold ring and two large gold bracelets. When Rebekah had finished bringing the water, he gave her the ring for her nose and the bracelets for her arms.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">Then he said, &amp;apos;Please tell me who your father is. Does he have room in his house for me and my men to spend the night?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">She answered, &amp;apos;My father is Bethuel, the son of Nahor and Milcah.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">We have a place where you and your men can stay, and we also have enough straw and feed for your camels.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">Then the servant bowed his head and prayed,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">&amp;apos;I thank you, Lord God of my master Abraham! You have led me to his relatives and kept your promise to him.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">Rebekah ran straight home and told her family everything.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">Then Laban said, &amp;apos;The Lord has brought you safely here. Come home with me. There's no need for you to keep on standing outside. I have a room ready for you in our house, and there's also a place for your camels.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">Abraham's servant went home with Laban, where Laban's servants unloaded his camels and gave them straw and feed. Then they brought water into the house, so Abraham's servant and his men could wash their feet.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">After that, they brought in food. But the servant said, &amp;apos;Before I eat, I must tell you why I have come.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">The servant explained:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">The Lord has been good to my master and has made him very rich. He has given him many sheep, goats, cattle, camels, and donkeys, as well as a lot of silver and gold, and many slaves.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">Sarah, my master's wife, didn't have any children until she was very old. Then she had a son, and my master has given him everything.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">I solemnly promised my master that I would do what he said. And he told me, &amp;apos;Don't choose a wife for my son from the women in this land of Canaan.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">Instead, go back to the land where I was born and find a wife for my son from among my relatives.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">I asked my master, &amp;apos;What if the young woman refuses to come with me?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">My master answered, &amp;apos;I have always obeyed the Lord , and he will send his angel to help you find my son a wife from among my own relatives.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">But if they refuse to let her come back with you, then you are freed from your promise.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">When I came to the well today, I silently prayed, &amp;apos;You, Lord , are the God my master Abraham worships, so please lead me to a wife for his son</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43">while I am here at the well. When a young woman comes out to get water, I'll ask her to give me a drink.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44">If she gives me a drink and offers to get some water for my camels, I'll know she is the one you have chosen.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45">Even before I had finished praying, Rebekah came by with a water jar on her shoulder. When she had filled the jar, I asked her for a drink.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46">She quickly lowered the jar from her shoulder and said, &amp;apos;Have a drink. Then I'll get water for your camels.&amp;apos; So I drank, and after that she got some water for my camels.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="47">I asked her who her father was, and she answered, &amp;apos;My father is Bethuel the son of Nahor and Milcah.&amp;apos; At once I put the ring in her nose and the bracelets on her arms.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="48">Then I bowed my head and gave thanks to the God my master Abraham worships. The Lord had led me straight to my master's relatives, and I had found a wife for his son.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="49">Now please tell me if you are willing to do the right thing for my master. Will you treat him fairly, or do I have to look for another young woman?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="50">Laban and Bethuel answered, &amp;apos;The Lord has done this. We have no choice in the matter.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="51">Take Rebekah with you; she can marry your master's son, just as the Lord has said.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="52">Abraham's servant bowed down and thanked the Lord .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="53">Then he gave clothing, as well as silver and gold jewelry, to Rebekah. He also gave expensive gifts to her brother and her mother.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="54">Abraham's servant and the men with him ate and drank, then spent the night there. The next morning they got up, and the servant told Rebekah's mother and brother, &amp;apos;I would like to go back to my master now.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="55">&amp;apos;Let Rebekah stay with us for a week or ten days,&amp;apos; they answered. &amp;apos;Then she may go.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="56">But he said, &amp;apos;Don't make me stay any longer. The Lord has already helped me find a wife for my master's son. Now let us return.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="57">They answered, &amp;apos;Let's ask Rebekah what she wants to do.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="58">They called her and asked, &amp;apos;Are you willing to leave with this man at once?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="59">So they agreed to let Rebekah and an old family servant woman leave immediately with Abraham's servant and his men.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="60">They gave Rebekah their blessing and said, &amp;apos;We pray that God will give you many children and grandchildren and that he will help them defeat their enemies.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="61">Afterwards, Rebekah and the young women who were to travel with her prepared to leave. Then they got on camels and left with Abraham's servant and his men.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="62">At that time Isaac was living in the southern part of Canaan near a place called &amp;apos;The Well of the Living One Who Sees Me.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="66">The servant told Isaac everything that had happened.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="67">Isaac took Rebekah into the tent where his mother had lived before she died, and Rebekah became his wife. He loved her and was comforted over the loss of his mother.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="25">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Abraham married Keturah,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">and they had six sons: Zimran, Jokshan, Medan, Midian, Ishbak, and Shuah.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Later, Jokshan became the father of Sheba and Dedan, and when Dedan grew up, he had three sons: Asshurim, Letushim, and Leummim.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Midian also had five sons: Ephah, Epher, Hanoch, Abida, and Eldaah. Almost 20 years later, &amp;apos;Your two sons will become The younger of the two will be stronger, and the older son will be his servant.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">God blessed Isaac after this, and Isaac moved to a place called &amp;apos;The Well of the Living One Who Sees Me.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Ishmael was the son of Abraham and Hagar, the slave woman of Sarah.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Ishmael had twelve sons, in this order: Nebaioth, Kedar, Adbeel, Mibsam,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Mishma, Dumah, Massa,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Hadad, Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Each of Ishmael's sons was a tribal chief, and a village was named after each of them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Isaac was the son of Abraham,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">and he was 40 years old when he married Rebekah, the daughter of Bethuel. She was also the sister of Laban, the Aramean from northern Syria.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Rebekah still had no children. So Isaac asked the Lord to let her have a child, and the Lord answered his prayer.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Before Rebekah gave birth, she knew she was going to have twins, because she could feel them inside her, fighting each other. She thought, &amp;apos;Why is this happening to me?&amp;apos; Finally, she asked the Lord why her twins were fighting,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">and he told her: two separate nations.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">When Rebekah gave birth,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">the first baby was covered with red hair, so he was named Esau.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">The second baby grabbed on to his brother's heel, so they named him Jacob. Isaac was 60 years old when they were born.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">As Jacob and Esau grew older, Esau liked the outdoors and became a good hunter, while Jacob lived the quiet life of a shepherd.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">Esau would take the meat of wild animals to his father Isaac, so Isaac loved him more, but Jacob was his mother's favorite son.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">One day, when Jacob was cooking some stew, Esau came home hungry</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">and said, &amp;apos;I'm starving to death! Here and now give me some of that red stew!&amp;apos; That's how Esau got the name &amp;apos;Edom.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">Jacob replied, &amp;apos;Sell me your rights as the first-born son.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">&amp;apos;I'm about to die,&amp;apos; Esau answered. &amp;apos;What good will those rights do me?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">But Jacob said, &amp;apos;Promise me your birthrights, here and now!&amp;apos; And that's what Esau did.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">Jacob then gave Esau some bread and some of the bean stew, and when Esau had finished eating and drinking, he just got up and left, showing how little he thought of his rights as the first-born.</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="26">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Once during Abraham's lifetime, the fields had not produced enough grain, and now the same thing happened. So Isaac went to King Abimelech of the Philistines in the land of Gerar,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">because the Lord had appeared to Isaac and said: Isaac, stay away from Egypt! I will show you where I want you to go. &amp;apos;Because I thought someone would kill me,&amp;apos; Isaac answered.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">You will live there as a foreigner, but I will be with you and bless you. I will keep my promise to your father Abraham by giving this land to you and your descendants.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">I will give you as many descendants as there are stars in the sky, and I will give your descendants all of this land. They will be a blessing to every nation on earth,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">because Abraham did everything I told him to do.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Isaac moved to Gerar</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">with his beautiful wife Rebekah. He was afraid that someone might kill him to get her, and so he told everyone that Rebekah was his sister.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">After Isaac had been there a long time, King Abimelech looked out a window and saw Isaac hugging and kissing Rebekah.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Abimelech called him in and said, &amp;apos;Rebekah must be your wife! Why did you say she is your sister?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">&amp;apos;Don't you know what you've done?&amp;apos; Abimelech exclaimed. &amp;apos;If someone had slept with her, you would have made our whole nation guilty!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Then Abimelech warned his people that anyone who even touched Isaac or Rebekah would be put to death.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Isaac planted grain and had a good harvest that same year. The Lord blessed him,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">and Isaac was so successful that he became very rich.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">In fact, the Philistines were jealous of the large number of sheep, goats, and slaves that Isaac owned,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">and they stopped up the wells that Abraham's servants had dug before his death.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Finally, Abimelech said, &amp;apos;Isaac, I want you to leave our country. You have become too powerful to stay here.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Isaac left and settled in Gerar Valley,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">where he cleaned out those wells that the Philistines had stopped up. Isaac also gave each of the wells the same name that Abraham had given to them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">While his servants were digging in the valley, they found a spring-fed well.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">But the shepherds of Gerar Valley quarreled with Isaac's shepherds and claimed the water belonged to them. So this well was named &amp;apos;Quarrel,&amp;apos; because they had quarreled with Isaac.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Isaac's servants dug another well, and the shepherds also quarreled about it. So that well was named &amp;apos;Jealous.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Finally, they dug one more well. There was no quarreling this time, and the well was named &amp;apos;Lots of Room,&amp;apos; because the Lord had given them room and would make them very successful.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">Isaac went on to Beersheba,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">where the Lord appeared to him that night and told him, &amp;apos;Don't be afraid! I am the God who was worshiped by your father Abraham, my servant. I will be with you and bless you, and because of Abraham I will give you many descendants.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">Isaac built an altar there and worshiped the Lord . Then he set up camp, and his servants started digging a well.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">Meanwhile, Abimelech had left Gerar and was taking his advisor Ahuzzath and his army commander Phicol to see Isaac.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">When they arrived, Isaac asked, &amp;apos;Why are you here? Didn't you send me away because you hated me?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">They answered, &amp;apos;We now know for certain that the Lord is with you, and we have decided there needs to be a peace treaty between you and us. So let's make a solemn agreement</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">not to harm each other. Remember, we have never hurt you, and when we sent you away, we let you go in peace. The Lord has truly blessed you.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">Isaac gave a big feast for them, and everyone ate and drank.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">Early the next morning Isaac and the others made a solemn agreement, then he let them go in peace.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">Later that same day Isaac's servants came and said, &amp;apos;We've struck water!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">So Isaac named the well Shibah, and the town is still called Beersheba.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">When Esau was 40 years old, he married Judith the daughter of Beeri the Hittite and Basemath the daughter of Elon the Hittite.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">But these two women brought a lot of grief to Esau's parents Isaac and Rebekah.</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="27">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Isaac was old and almost blind, when he called in his first-born son Esau, who asked him, &amp;apos;Father, what can I do for you?&amp;apos; &amp;apos;Which one of my sons are you?&amp;apos; his father asked. &amp;apos;The Lord your God was kind to me,&amp;apos; Jacob answered. &amp;apos;Yes, I am,&amp;apos; Jacob answered. Jacob gave him some meat, and he ate it. He also gave him some wine, and he drank it. &amp;apos;The smell of my son is like a field the Lord has blessed. with dew from heaven and with fertile fields, rich with grain and grapes. and bow down to you. You will rule over your brothers, and they will kneel at your feet. Anyone who curses you will be cursed; anyone who blesses you will be blessed.&amp;apos; &amp;apos;I am Esau, your first-born son.&amp;apos; &amp;apos;Your home will be far from that fertile land, where dew comes down from the heavens. of your sword and be your brother's slave. But when you decide to be free, you will break loose.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Isaac replied, &amp;apos;I am old and might die at any time.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">So go hunting with your bow and arrows and kill a wild animal.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Cook some of that tasty food that I love so much and bring it to me. I want to eat it once more and give you my blessing before I die.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Rebekah had been listening, and as soon as Esau left to go hunting,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">she said to Jacob, &amp;apos;I heard your father tell Esau</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">to kill a wild animal and cook some tasty food for him before he dies. Your father said this because he wants to bless your brother with the Lord as his witness.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Now, my son, listen carefully to what I want you to do.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Go and kill two of your best young goats and bring them to me. I'll cook the tasty food that your father loves so much.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Then you can take it to him, so he can eat it and give you his blessing before he dies.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">&amp;apos;My brother Esau is a hairy man,&amp;apos; Jacob reminded her. &amp;apos;And I am not.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">If my father touches me and realizes I am trying to trick him, he will put a curse on me instead of giving me a blessing.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Rebekah insisted, &amp;apos;Let his curse fall on me! Just do what I say and bring me the meat.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">So Jacob brought the meat to his mother, and she cooked the tasty food that his father liked.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Then she took Esau's best clothes and put them on Jacob.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">She also covered the smooth part of his hands and neck with goatskins</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">and gave him some bread and the tasty food she had cooked.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Jacob went to his father and said, &amp;apos;Father, here I am.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Jacob replied, &amp;apos;I am Esau, your first-born, and I have done what you told me. Please sit up and eat the meat I have brought. Then you can give me your blessing.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Isaac asked, &amp;apos;My son, how did you find an animal so quickly?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">&amp;apos;My son,&amp;apos; Isaac said, &amp;apos;come closer, where I can touch you and find out if you really are Esau.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Jacob went closer. His father touched him and said, &amp;apos;You sound like Jacob, but your hands feel hairy like Esau's.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">And so Isaac blessed Jacob, thinking he was Esau.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">Isaac asked, &amp;apos;Are you really my son Esau?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">So Isaac told him, &amp;apos;Serve me the wild meat, and I can give you my blessing.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">Then Isaac said, &amp;apos;Son, come over here and kiss me.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">While Jacob was kissing him, Isaac caught the smell of his clothes and said:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">God will bless you, my son,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">Nations will be your servants</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">Right after Isaac had given Jacob his blessing and Jacob had gone, Esau came back from hunting.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">He cooked the tasty food, brought it to his father, and said, &amp;apos;Father, please sit up and eat the meat I have brought you, so you can give me your blessing.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">&amp;apos;Who are you?&amp;apos; Isaac asked.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">Isaac started trembling and said, &amp;apos;Then who brought me some wild meat right before you came in? I ate it and gave him a blessing that cannot be taken back.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">Esau cried out in great distress, &amp;apos;Father, give me a blessing too!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">Isaac answered, &amp;apos;Your brother tricked me and stole your blessing.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">Esau replied, &amp;apos;My brother deserves the name Jacob, because he has already cheated me twice. The first time he cheated me out of my rights as the first-born son, and now he has cheated me out of my blessing.&amp;apos; Then Esau asked his father, &amp;apos;Don't you have any blessing left for me?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">&amp;apos;My son,&amp;apos; Isaac answered, &amp;apos;I have made Jacob the ruler over you and your brothers, and all of you will be his servants. I have also promised him all the grain and grapes that he needs. There's nothing left that I can do for you.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">&amp;apos;Father,&amp;apos; Esau asked, &amp;apos;don't you have more than one blessing? You can surely give me a blessing too!&amp;apos; Then Esau started crying again.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">So his father said:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">You will live by the power</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">Esau hated his brother Jacob because he had stolen the blessing that was supposed to be his. So he said to himself, &amp;apos;Just as soon as my father dies, I'll kill Jacob.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">When Rebekah found out what Esau planned to do, she sent for Jacob and told him, &amp;apos;Son, your brother Esau is just waiting for a chance to kill you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43">Now listen carefully and do what I say. Go to the home of my brother Laban in Haran</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44">and stay with him for a while. When Esau stops being angry</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45">and forgets what you have done to him, I'll send for you to come home. Why should I lose both of my sons on the same day?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46">Rebekah later told Isaac, &amp;apos;Those Hittite wives of Esau are making my life miserable! If Jacob marries a Hittite woman, I'd be better off dead.&amp;apos;</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="28">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Isaac called in Jacob, then gave him a blessing, and said: Don't marry any of those Canaanite women. I am the Lord God who was worshiped by Abraham and Isaac. I will give to you and your family the land on which you are now sleeping.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Go at once to your mother's father Bethuel in northern Syria and choose a wife from one of the daughters of Laban, your mother's brother.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">I pray that God All-Powerful will bless you with many descendants and let you become a great nation.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">May he bless you with the land he promised Abraham, so that you will take over this land where we now live as foreigners.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Isaac then sent Jacob to stay with Rebekah's brother Laban, the son of Bethuel the Aramean.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Esau found out that his father Isaac had blessed Jacob and had warned him not to marry any of the Canaanite women. He also learned that Jacob had been sent to find a wife in northern Syria</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">and that he had obeyed his father and mother.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Esau already had several wives, but he now realized how much his father hated the Canaanite women.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">So he married Ishmael's daughter Mahalath, who was the sister of Nebaioth and the granddaughter of Abraham.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Jacob left the town of Beersheba and started out for Haran.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">At sunset he stopped for the night and went to sleep, resting his head on a large rock.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">In a dream he saw a ladder that reached from earth to heaven, and God's angels were going up and down on it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">The Lord was standing beside the ladder and said:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Your descendants will spread over the earth in all directions and will become as numerous as the specks of dust. Your family will be a blessing to all people.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Wherever you go, I will watch over you, then later I will bring you back to this land. I won't leave you&amp;ndash;I will do all I have promised.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Jacob woke up suddenly and thought, &amp;apos;The Lord is in this place, and I didn't even know it.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Then Jacob became frightened and said, &amp;apos;What a frightening place! It must be the house of God and the gateway to heaven.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">When Jacob got up early the next morning, he took the rock that he had used for a pillow and stood it up as a place of worship. Then he poured olive oil on the rock to dedicate it to God,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">and he named the place Bethel. Before that it had been named Luz.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Jacob solemnly promised God, &amp;apos;If you go with me and watch over me as I travel, and if you give me food and clothes</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">and bring me safely home again, you will be my God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">This rock will be your house, and I will give back to you a tenth of everything you give me.&amp;apos;</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="29">
			<VERS vnumber="1">As Jacob continued on his way to the east,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">he looked out in a field and saw a well where shepherds took their sheep for water. Three flocks of sheep were lying around the well, which was covered with a large rock.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Shepherds would roll the rock away when all their sheep had gathered there. Then after the sheep had been watered, the shepherds would roll the rock back over the mouth of the well. &amp;apos;We're from Haran,&amp;apos; they answered. &amp;apos;Yes we do,&amp;apos; they replied. &amp;apos;He's fine,&amp;apos; they answered. &amp;apos;And here comes his daughter Rachel with the sheep.&amp;apos; After Jacob had been there for a month,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Jacob asked the shepherds, &amp;apos;Where are you from?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Then he asked, &amp;apos;Do you know Nahor's grandson Laban?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">&amp;apos;How is he?&amp;apos; Jacob asked.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Jacob told them, &amp;apos;Look, the sun is still high up in the sky, and it's too early to bring in the rest of the flocks. Water your sheep and take them back to the pasture.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">But they replied, &amp;apos;We can't do that until they all get here, and the rock has been rolled away from the well.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">While Jacob was still talking with the men, his cousin Rachel came up with her father's sheep.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">When Jacob saw her and his uncle's sheep, he rolled the rock away and watered the sheep.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">He then kissed Rachel and started crying because he was so happy.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">He told her that he was the son of her aunt Rebekah, and she ran and told her father about him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">As soon as Laban heard the news, he ran out to meet Jacob. He hugged and kissed him and brought him to his home, where Jacob told him everything that had happened.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Laban said, &amp;apos;You are my nephew, and you are like one of my own family.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Laban said to him, &amp;apos;You shouldn't have to work without pay, just because you are a relative of mine. What do you want me to give you?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Since Jacob was in love with Rachel, he answered, &amp;apos;If you will let me marry Rachel, I'll work seven years for you.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Laban replied, &amp;apos;It's better for me to let you marry Rachel than for someone else to have her. So stay and work for me.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Jacob worked seven years for Laban, but the time seemed like only a few days, because he loved Rachel so much.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Jacob said to Laban, &amp;apos;The time is up, and I want to marry Rachel now!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">So Laban gave a big feast and invited all their neighbors.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">But that evening he brought Leah to Jacob, who married her and spent the night with her.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">Laban also gave Zilpah to Leah as her servant woman.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">The next morning Jacob found out that he had married Leah, and he asked Laban, &amp;apos;Why did you do this to me? Didn't I work to get Rachel? Why did you trick me?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">Laban replied, &amp;apos;In our country the older daughter must get married first.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">After you spend this week with Leah, you may also marry Rachel. But you will have to work for me another seven years.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">The Lord knew that Jacob loved Rachel more than he did Leah, and so he gave children to Leah, but not to Rachel.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">Leah gave birth to a son and named him Reuben. Then she said, &amp;apos;The Lord has taken away my sorrow. Now my husband will love me more than he does Rachel.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">She had a second son and named him Simeon, because she said, &amp;apos;The Lord has heard that my husband doesn't love me.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">When Leah's third son was born, she said, &amp;apos;Now my husband will hold me close.&amp;apos; So this son was named Levi.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">She had one more son and named him Judah, because she said, &amp;apos;I'll praise the Lord !&amp;apos;</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="30">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Rachel was very jealous of Leah for having children, and she said to Jacob, &amp;apos;I'll die if you don't give me some children!&amp;apos; &amp;apos;All right,&amp;apos; Rachel answered. &amp;apos;Let me have the flowers, and you can sleep with Jacob tonight.&amp;apos; They slept together that night, You've seen how hard I've worked for you, and you know how your flocks and herds have grown under my care. Then Jacob told him: I don't want you to pay me anything. Just do one thing, and I'll take care of your sheep and goats.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">But Jacob became upset with Rachel and answered, &amp;apos;Don't blame me! I'm not God.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">&amp;apos;Here, take my servant Bilhah,&amp;apos; Rachel told him. &amp;apos;Have children by her, and I'll let them be born on my knees to show that they are mine.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Then Rachel let Jacob marry Bilhah,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">and they had a son.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Rachel named him Dan, because she said, &amp;apos;God has answered my prayers. He judged in my favor and has given me a son.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">When Bilhah and Jacob had a second son,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Rachel said, &amp;apos;I've struggled hard with my sister, and I've won!&amp;apos; So she named the boy Naphtali.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">When Leah realized she could not have any more children, she let Jacob marry her servant Zilpah,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">and they had a son.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">&amp;apos;I'm really lucky,&amp;apos; Leah said, and she named the boy Gad.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">When they had another son,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Leah exclaimed, &amp;apos;I'm happy now, and all the women will say how happy I am.&amp;apos; So she named him Asher.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">During the time of the wheat harvest, Reuben found some love flowers and took them to his mother Leah. Rachel asked Leah for some of them,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">but Leah said, &amp;apos;It's bad enough that you stole my husband! Now you want my son's love flowers too.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">That evening when Jacob came in from the fields, Leah told him, &amp;apos;You're sleeping with me tonight. I hired you with my son's love flowers.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">and God answered Leah's prayers by giving her a fifth son.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Leah shouted, &amp;apos;God has rewarded me for letting Jacob marry my servant,&amp;apos; and she named the boy Issachar.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">When Leah had another son,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">she exclaimed, &amp;apos;God has given me a wonderful gift, and my husband will praise me for giving him six sons.&amp;apos; So she named the boy Zebulun.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Later, Leah had a daughter and named her Dinah.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">&amp;apos;I'll name the boy Joseph, and I'll pray that the Lord will give me another son.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">After Joseph was born, Jacob said to Laban, &amp;apos;Release me from our agreement and let me return to my own country.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">You know how hard I've worked for you, so let me take my wives and children and leave.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">Jacob answered:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">You didn't have much before I came, but the Lord has blessed everything I have ever done for you. Now it's time for me to start looking out for my own family.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">&amp;apos;How much do you want me to pay you?&amp;apos; Laban asked.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">Let me go through your flocks and herds and take the sheep and goats that are either spotted or speckled and the black lambs. That's all you need to give me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">In the future you can easily find out if I've been honest. Just look and see if my animals are either spotted or speckled, or if the lambs are black. If they aren't, they've been stolen from you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">&amp;apos;I agree to that,&amp;apos; was Laban's response.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">Before the end of the day, Laban had separated his spotted and speckled animals and the black lambs from the others and had put his sons in charge of them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">Then Laban made Jacob keep the rest of the sheep and goats at a distance of three days' journey.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">Jacob cut branches from some poplar trees and from some almond and evergreen trees. He peeled off part of the bark and made the branches look spotted and speckled.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">Then he put the branches where the sheep and goats would see them while they were drinking from the water trough. The goats mated there</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">in front of the branches, and their young were spotted and speckled.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">Some of the sheep that Jacob was keeping for Laban were already spotted. And when the others were ready to mate, he made sure that they faced in the direction of the spotted and black ones. In this way, Jacob built up a flock of sheep for himself and did not put them with the other sheep.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">When the stronger sheep were mating near the drinking place, Jacob made sure that the spotted branches were there.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">But he would not put out the branches when the weaker animals were mating. So Jacob got all of the healthy animals, and Laban got what was left.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43">Jacob soon became rich and successful. He owned many sheep, goats, camels, and donkeys, as well as a lot of slaves.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="31">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Jacob heard that Laban's sons were complaining, &amp;apos;Jacob is now a rich man, and he got everything he owns from our father.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Jacob also noticed that Laban was not as friendly as he had been before.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">One day the Lord said, &amp;apos;Jacob, go back to your relatives in the land of your ancestors, and I will be with you.&amp;apos; Your father isn't as friendly with me as he used to be, but the God my ancestors worshiped has been on my side. There's nothing left for us to inherit from our father. Look what you've done! You've tricked me and run off with my daughters like a kidnapper. What have I done wrong? Have I committed some crime? Is that why you hunted me down? If you mistreat my daughters or marry other women, I may not know about it, but remember, God is watching us!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Jacob sent for Rachel and Leah to meet him in the pasture where he kept his sheep,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">and he told them:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">You know that I have worked hard for your father</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">and that he keeps cheating me by changing my wages time after time. But God has protected me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">When your father said the speckled sheep would be my wages, all of them were speckled. And when he said the spotted ones would be mine, all of them were spotted.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">That's how God has taken sheep and goats from your father and given them to me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Once, when the flocks were mating, I dreamed that all the rams were either spotted or speckled.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Then God's angel called me by name. I answered,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">and he said, &amp;apos;Notice that all the rams are either spotted or speckled. I know everything Laban is doing to you,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">and I am the God you worshiped at Bethel, when you poured olive oil on a rock and made a promise to me. Leave here at once and return to the land where you were born.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Rachel and Leah said to Jacob:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">He treats us like foreigners and has even cheated us out of the bride price that should have been ours.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">So do whatever God tells you to do. Even the property God took from our father and gave to you really belongs to us and our children.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Then Jacob, his wives, and his children got on camels and left</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">northern Syria for the home of his father Isaac in Canaan. Jacob took along all his flocks, herds, and other property.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Before Rachel left, she stole the household idols while Laban was out shearing his sheep.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Jacob tricked Laban the Aramean by not saying that he intended to leave.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">When Jacob crossed the Euphrates River and headed for the hill country of Gilead, he took with him everything he owned.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Three days later Laban found out that Jacob had gone.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">So he took some of his relatives along and chased after Jacob for seven days, before catching up with him in the hill country of Gilead.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">But God appeared to Laban in a dream that night and warned, &amp;apos;Don't say a word to Jacob. Don't make a threat or a promise.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">Jacob had set up camp in the hill country of Gilead, when Laban and his relatives came and set up camp in another part of the hill country. Laban went to Jacob</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">and said:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">Why did you sneak away without telling me? I would have given you a going-away party with singing and with music on tambourines and harps.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">You didn't even give me a chance to kiss my own grandchildren and daughters goodbye. That was really foolish.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">I could easily hurt you, but the God your father worshiped has warned me not to make any threats or promises.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">I can understand why you were eager to return to your father, but why did you have to steal my idols?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">Jacob answered, &amp;apos;I left secretly because I was afraid you would take your daughters from me by force.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">If you find that any one of us has taken your idols, I'll have that person killed. Let your relatives be witnesses. Show me what belongs to you, and you can take it back.&amp;apos; Jacob did not realize that Rachel had stolen the household idols.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">Laban searched the tents of Jacob, Leah, and the two servant women, but did not find the idols. Then he went to Rachel's tent.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">She had already hidden them in the cushion she used as a saddle and was sitting on it. Laban searched everywhere and did not find them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">Rachel said, &amp;apos;Father, please don't be angry with me for not getting up; I'm having my period.&amp;apos; Laban kept on searching, but still did not find the idols.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">Jacob became very angry and said to Laban:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">After searching through everything I have, did you find anything of yours? If so, put it here, where your relatives and mine can see it. Then we can decide what to do.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">In all the 20 years that I've worked for you, not one of your sheep or goats has had a miscarriage, and I've never eaten even one of your rams.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">If a wild animal killed one of your sheep or goats, I paid for it myself. In fact, you demanded the full price, whether the animal was killed during the day or at night.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">I sweated every day, and I couldn't sleep at night because of the cold.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">I had to work 14 of these 20 long years to earn your two daughters and another 6 years to buy your sheep and goats. During that time you kept changing my wages.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">If the fearsome God worshiped by Abraham and my father Isaac had not been on my side, you would have sent me away without a thing. But God saw my hard work, and he knew the trouble I was in, so he helped me. Then last night he told you how wrong you were.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43">Laban said to Jacob, &amp;apos;Leah and Rachel are my daughters, and their children belong to me. All these sheep you are taking are really mine too. In fact, everything you have belongs to me. But there is nothing I can do to keep my daughters and their children.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44">So I am ready to make an agreement with you, and we will pile up some large rocks here to remind us of the agreement.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45">After Jacob had set up a large rock,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46">he told his men to get some more rocks and pile them up next to it. Then Jacob and Laban ate a meal together beside the rocks.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="47">Laban named the pile of rocks Jegar Sahadutha. But Jacob named it Galeed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="48">Laban said to Jacob, &amp;apos;This pile of rocks will remind us of our agreement.&amp;apos; That's why the place was named Galeed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="49">Laban also said, &amp;apos;This pile of rocks means that the Lord will watch us both while we are apart from each other.&amp;apos; So the place was also named Mizpah.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="50">Then Laban said:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="53">My father Nahor, your grandfather Abraham, and their ancestors all worshiped the same God, and he will make sure that we each keep the agreement. Then Jacob made a promise in the name of the fearsome God his father Isaac had worshiped.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="54">Jacob killed an animal and offered it as a sacrifice there on the mountain, and he invited his men to eat with him. After the meal they spent the night on the mountain.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="55">Early the next morning, Laban kissed his daughters and his grandchildren goodbye, then he left to go back home.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="32">
			<VERS vnumber="1">As Jacob was on his way back home, some of God's angels came and met him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">When Jacob saw them, he said, &amp;apos;This is God's camp.&amp;apos; So he named the place Mahanaim. You, Lord , are the God who was worshiped by my grandfather Abraham and by my father Isaac. You told me to return home to my family, and you promised to be with me and make me successful. A man came and fought with Jacob until just before daybreak. &amp;apos;You can't go until you bless me,&amp;apos; Jacob replied. &amp;apos;Jacob,&amp;apos; he answered. &amp;apos;Don't you know who I am?&amp;apos; he asked. And he blessed Jacob.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Jacob sent messengers on ahead to Esau, who lived in the land of Seir, also known as Edom.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Jacob told them to say to Esau, &amp;apos;Master, I am your servant! I have lived with Laban all this time,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">and now I own cattle, donkeys, and sheep, as well as many slaves. Master, I am sending these messengers in the hope that you will be kind to me.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">When the messengers returned, they told Jacob, &amp;apos;We went to your brother Esau, and now he is heading this way with 400 men.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Jacob was so frightened that he divided his people, sheep, cattle, and camels into two groups.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">He thought, &amp;apos;If Esau attacks one group, perhaps the other can escape.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Then Jacob prayed:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">I don't deserve all the good things you have done for me, your servant. When I first crossed the Jordan, I had only my walking stick, but now I have two large groups of people and animals.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Please rescue me from my brother. I am afraid he will come and attack not only me, but my wives and children as well.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">But you have promised that I would be a success and that someday it will be as hard to count my descendants as it is to count the grains of sand along the seashore.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">After Jacob had spent the night there, he chose some animals as gifts for Esau:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Jacob put servants in charge of each herd and told them, &amp;apos;Go ahead of me and keep a space between each herd.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Then he said to the servant in charge of the first herd, &amp;apos;When Esau meets you, he will ask whose servant you are. He will want to know where you are going and who owns those animals in front of you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">So tell him, &amp;quot;They belong to your servant Jacob, who is coming this way. He is sending them as a gift to his master Esau.&amp;quot; &amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Jacob also told the men in charge of the second and third herds and those who followed to say the same thing when they met Esau.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">And Jacob told them to be sure to say that he was right behind them. Jacob hoped the gifts would make Esau friendly, so Esau would be glad to see him when they met.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Jacob's men took the gifts on ahead of him, but he spent the night in camp.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">Afterwards, Jacob went back and spent the rest of the night alone.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">When the man saw that he could not win, he struck Jacob on the hip and threw it out of joint.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">They kept on wrestling until the man said, &amp;apos;Let go of me! It's almost daylight.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">Then the man asked, &amp;apos;What is your name?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">The man said, &amp;apos;From now on, your name will no longer be Jacob. You will be called Israel, because you have wrestled with God and with men, and you have won.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">Jacob said, &amp;apos;Now tell me your name.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">Jacob said, &amp;apos;I have seen God face to face, and I am still alive.&amp;apos; So he named the place Peniel.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">The sun was coming up as Jacob was leaving Peniel. He was limping because he had been struck on the hip,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">and the muscle on his hip joint had been injured. That's why even today the people of Israel don't eat the hip muscle of any animal.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="33">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Later that day Jacob met Esau coming with his 400 men. So Jacob told his children to walk with their mothers.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">The two servant women, Zilpah and Bilhah, together with their children went first, followed by Leah and her children, then by Rachel and Joseph.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Jacob himself walked in front of them all, bowing to the ground seven times as he came near his brother. Jacob answered, &amp;apos;These are the children the Lord has been kind enough to give to me, your servant.&amp;apos; &amp;apos;Master,&amp;apos; Jacob answered, &amp;apos;I sent them so you would be friendly to me.&amp;apos; &amp;apos;You don't have to do that,&amp;apos; Jacob answered. &amp;apos;I am happy, simply knowing that you are friendly to me.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">But Esau ran toward Jacob and hugged and kissed him. Then the two brothers started crying.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">When Esau noticed the women and children he asked, &amp;apos;Whose children are these?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Then the two servant women and their children came and bowed down to Esau.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Next, Leah and her children came and bowed down; finally, Joseph and Rachel also came and bowed down.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Esau asked Jacob, &amp;apos;Why did you send those herds I met along the road?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">&amp;apos;But, brother, I already have plenty,&amp;apos; Esau replied. &amp;apos;Keep them for yourself.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">&amp;apos;No!&amp;apos; Jacob said. &amp;apos;Please accept them as a sign of your friendship for me. When you welcomed me and I saw your face, it was like seeing the face of God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Please accept these as gifts I brought to you. God has been good to me, and I have everything I need.&amp;apos; Jacob kept insisting until Esau agreed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">&amp;apos;Let's get ready to travel,&amp;apos; Esau said. &amp;apos;I'll go along with you.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">But Jacob answered, &amp;apos;Master, you know traveling is hard on children, and I have to look after the sheep and goats that are nursing their young. If my animals travel too much in one day, they will all die.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Why don't you go on ahead and let me travel along slowly with the children, the herds, and the flocks. We can meet again in the country of Edom.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Esau replied, &amp;apos;Let me leave some of my men with you.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">So Esau left for Edom.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">But Jacob went to Succoth, where he built a house for himself and set up shelters for his animals. That's why the place is called Succoth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">After leaving northern Syria, Jacob arrived safely at Shechem in Canaan and set up camp outside the city.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">The land where he camped was owned by the descendants of Hamor, the father of Shechem. So Jacob paid them 100 pieces of silver for the property,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">then he set up his tents and built an altar there to honor the God of Israel.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="34">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Dinah, the daughter of Jacob and Leah, went to visit some of the women who lived nearby.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">She was seen by Hamor's son Shechem, the leader of the Hivites, and he grabbed her and raped her.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">But Shechem was attracted to Dinah, so he told her how much he loved her.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Shechem even asked his father to arrange for him to marry her. My son Shechem really loves Dinah. Please let him marry her.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Meanwhile, Jacob heard what had happened. But his sons were out in the fields with the cattle, so he did not do anything at the time.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Hamor arrived at Jacob's home</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">just as Jacob's sons were coming in from work. When they learned that their sister had been raped, they became furiously angry, because nothing is more disgraceful than rape, and it must not be tolerated.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Hamor said to Jacob and his sons:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Why don't you start letting your families marry into our families and ours marry into yours?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">You can share this land with us. Move freely about until you find the property you want; then buy it and settle down here.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Shechem added, &amp;apos;Do this favor for me, and I'll give whatever you want.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Ask anything, no matter how expensive. I'll do anything, just let me marry Dinah.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Jacob's sons wanted to get even with Shechem and his father because of what had happened to their sister.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">So they tricked them by saying: You're not circumcised! It would be a disgrace for us to let you marry Dinah now.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">But we will let you marry her, if you and the other men in your tribe agree to be circumcised.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Then your families can marry into ours, and ours can marry into yours, and we can live together like one nation.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">But if you don't agree to be circumcised, we'll take Dinah and leave this place.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Hamor and Shechem liked what was said.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Shechem was the most respected person in his family, and he was so in love with Dinah that he hurried off to get everything done.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">The two men met with the other leaders of their city and told them:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">These people really are friendly. Why not let them move freely about until they find the property they want? There's enough land here for them and for us. Then our families can marry into theirs, and theirs can marry into ours.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">We have to do only one thing before they will agree to stay here and become one nation with us. Our men will have to be circumcised just like theirs.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">Just think! We'll get their property, as well as their flocks and herds. All we have to do is to agree, and they will live here with us.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">Every grown man followed this advice and got circumcised.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">Three days later the men who had been circumcised were still weak from pain. So Simeon and Levi, two of Dinah's brothers, attacked with their swords and killed every man in the town,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">including Hamor and Shechem. Then they took Dinah and left.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">Jacob's other sons came and took everything they wanted. All this was done because of the horrible thing that had happened to their sister.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">They took sheep, goats, donkeys, and everything else that was in the town or the countryside.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">After taking everything of value from the houses, they dragged away the wives and children of their victims.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, &amp;apos;Look what you've done! Now I'm in real trouble with the Canaanites and Perizzites who live around here. There aren't many of us, and if they attack, they'll kill everyone in my household.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">They answered, &amp;apos;Was it right to let our own sister be treated that way?&amp;apos;</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="35">
			<VERS vnumber="1">God told Jacob, &amp;apos;Return to Bethel, where I appeared to you when you were running from your brother Esau. Make your home there and build an altar for me.&amp;apos; Get rid of your foreign gods! Then make yourselves acceptable to worship God and put on clean clothes. Jacob and his wife Rachel had Joseph and Benjamin. Rachel's servant woman Bilhah had two more sons: Dan and Naphtali.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Jacob said to his family and to everyone else who was traveling with him:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Afterwards, we'll go to Bethel. I will build an altar there for God, who answered my prayers when I was in trouble and who has always been at my side.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">So everyone gave Jacob their idols and their earrings, and he buried them under the oak tree near Shechem.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">While Jacob and his family were traveling through Canaan, God terrified the people in the towns so much that no one dared bother them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Finally, they reached Bethel, also known as Luz.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Jacob built an altar there and called it &amp;apos;God of Bethel,&amp;apos; because that was the place where God had appeared to him when he was running from Esau.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">While they were there, Rebekah's personal servant Deborah died. They buried her under an oak tree and called it &amp;apos;Weeping Oak.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">I will give you the land that I promised Abraham and Isaac, and it will belong to your family forever.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">After God had gone,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Jacob set up a large rock, so that he would remember what had happened there. Then he poured wine and olive oil on the rock to show that it was dedicated to God,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">and he named the place Bethel.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Jacob and his family had left Bethel and were still a long way from Ephrath, when the time came for Rachel's baby to be born.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">She was having a rough time, but the woman who was helping her said, &amp;apos;Don't worry! It's a boy.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Rachel was at the point of death, and right before dying, she said, &amp;apos;I'll name him Benoni.&amp;apos; But Jacob called him Benjamin.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Rachel was buried beside the road to Ephrath, which is also called Bethlehem.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Jacob set up a tombstone over her grave, and it is still there.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Jacob, also known as Israel, traveled to the south of Eder Tower, where he set up camp.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">During their time there, Jacob's oldest son Reuben slept with Bilhah, who was one of Jacob's other wives. And Jacob found out about it.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="3">the third was Basemath, who was Ishmael's daughter and Nebaioth's sister. Esau and Basemath had a son named Reuel, whose sons were Nahath, Zerah, Shammah, and Mizzah. Esau and Oholibamah had three sons: Jeush, Jalam, and Korah. Bela son of Beor from Dinhabah; Jobab son of Zerah from Bozrah; Husham from the land of Teman; Hadad son of Bedad from Avith (Bedad had defeated the Midianites in Moab); Samlah from Masrekah; Shaul from the city of Rehoboth on the Euphrates River; Baalhanan son of Achbor; Hadar from the city of Pau (his wife Mehetabel was the daughter of Matred and the granddaughter of Mezahab).</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Esau took his children and wives, his relatives and servants, his animals and possessions he had acquired while in Canaan, and moved far from Jacob.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">He did this because the land was too crowded and could not support him and his brother with their flocks and herds.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">That's why Esau made his home in the hill country of Seir.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Esau and Adah's oldest son was Eliphaz, and the clans that descended from him were Teman, Omar, Zepho, Kenaz,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Korah, Gatam, and Amalek. These and Esau's other descendants lived in the land of Edom.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="18">The clans that descended from Esau and Oholibamah the daughter of Anah were Jeush, Jalam, and Korah.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">All of these clans descended from Esau, who was known as Edom.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Seir was from the Horite tribe that had lived in Edom before the time of Esau. The clans that had descended from him were Lotan, Shobal, Zibeon, Anah,</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="37">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Jacob lived in the land of Canaan, where his father Isaac had lived,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">and this is the story of his family. When Jacob's son Joseph was 17 years old, he took care of the sheep with his brothers, the sons of Bilhah and Zilpah. But he was always telling his father all sorts of bad things about his brothers. &amp;apos;Yes, sir,&amp;apos; Joseph answered. Joseph was near Shechem Joseph left and found his brothers in Dothan.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Jacob loved Joseph more than he did any of his other sons, because Joseph was born when Jacob was very old. Jacob had even given Joseph a fancy coat</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">which showed that Joseph was his favorite son, and so Joseph's brothers hated him and would not be friendly to him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">One day, Joseph told his brothers what he had dreamed, and they hated him even more.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Joseph said, &amp;apos;Let me tell you about my dream.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">We were out in the field, tying up bundles of wheat. Suddenly my bundle stood up, and your bundles gathered around and bowed down to it.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">His brothers asked, &amp;apos;Do you really think you are going to be king and rule over us?&amp;apos; Now they hated Joseph more than ever because of what he had said about his dream.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Joseph later had another dream, and he told his brothers, &amp;apos;Listen to what else I dreamed. The sun, the moon, and eleven stars bowed down to me.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">When he told his father about this dream, his father became angry and said, &amp;apos;What's that supposed to mean? Are your mother and I and your brothers all going to come and bow down to you?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Joseph's brothers were jealous of him, but his father kept wondering about the dream.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">One day when Joseph's brothers had taken the sheep to a pasture near Shechem,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">his father Jacob said to him, &amp;apos;I want you to go to your brothers. They are with the sheep near Shechem.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">His father said, &amp;apos;Go and find out how your brothers and the sheep are doing. Then come back and let me know.&amp;apos; So he sent him from Hebron Valley.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">and wandering through the fields, when a man asked, &amp;apos;What are you looking for?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Joseph answered, &amp;apos;I'm looking for my brothers who are watching the sheep. Can you tell me where they are?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">&amp;apos;They're not here anymore,&amp;apos; the man replied. &amp;apos;I overheard them say they were going to Dothan.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">But before he got there, they saw him coming and made plans to kill him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">They said to one another, &amp;apos;Look, here comes the hero of those dreams!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Let's kill him and throw him into a pit and say that some wild animal ate him. Then we'll see what happens to those dreams.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Reuben heard this and tried to protect Joseph from them. &amp;apos;Let's not kill him,&amp;apos; he said.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">&amp;apos;Don't murder him or even harm him. Just throw him into a well out here in the desert.&amp;apos; Reuben planned to rescue Joseph later and take him back to his father.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">When Joseph came to his brothers, they pulled off his fancy coat</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">and threw him into a dry well.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">As Joseph's brothers sat down to eat, they looked up and saw a caravan of Ishmaelites coming from Gilead. Their camels were loaded with all kinds of spices that they were taking to Egypt.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">So Judah said, &amp;apos;What will we gain if we kill our brother and hide his body?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">Let's sell him to the Ishmaelites and not harm him. After all, he is our brother.&amp;apos; And the others agreed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">When the Midianite merchants came by, Joseph's brothers took him out of the well, and for 20 pieces of silver they sold him to the Ishmaelites who took him to Egypt.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">When Reuben returned to the well and did not find Joseph there, he tore his clothes in sorrow.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">Then he went back to his brothers and said, &amp;apos;The boy is gone! What am I going to do?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">Joseph's brothers killed a goat and dipped Joseph's fancy coat in its blood.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">After this, they took the coat to their father and said, &amp;apos;We found this! Look at it carefully and see if it belongs to your son.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">Jacob knew it was Joseph's coat and said, &amp;apos;It's my son's coat! Joseph has been torn to pieces and eaten by some wild animal.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">Jacob mourned for Joseph a long time, and to show his sorrow he tore his clothes and wore sackcloth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">All of Jacob's children came to comfort him, but he refused to be comforted. &amp;apos;No,&amp;apos; he said, &amp;apos;I will go to my grave, mourning for my son.&amp;apos; So Jacob kept on grieving.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">Meanwhile, the Midianites had sold Joseph in Egypt to a man named Potiphar, who was the king's official in charge of the palace guard.</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="38">
			<VERS vnumber="1">About that time Judah left his brothers in the hill country and went to live near his friend Hirah in the town of Adullam.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">While there he met the daughter of Shua, a Canaanite man. Judah married her,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">and they had three sons. He named the first one Er;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">she named the next one Onan.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">The third one was born when Judah was in Chezib, and she named him Shelah. &amp;apos;What will you give me to keep until you send the goat?&amp;apos; she asked. &amp;apos;There's never been one here,&amp;apos; they answered. &amp;apos;Drag her out of town and burn her to death!&amp;apos; Judah shouted.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Later, Judah chose Tamar as a wife for Er, his oldest son.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">But Er was very evil, and the Lord took his life.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">So Judah told Onan, &amp;apos;It's your duty to marry Tamar and have a child for your brother.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Onan knew the child would not be his, and when he had sex with Tamar, he made sure that she would not get pregnant.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">The Lord wasn't pleased with Onan and took his life too.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Judah did not want the same thing to happen to his son Shelah, and he told Tamar, &amp;apos;Go home to your father and live there as a widow until my son Shelah is grown.&amp;apos; So Tamar went to live with her father.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Some years later Judah's wife died, and he mourned for her. He then went with his friend Hirah to the town of Timnah, where his sheep were being sheared.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Tamar found out that her father-in-law Judah was going to Timnah to shear his sheep.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">She also realized that Shelah was now a grown man, but she had not been allowed to marry him. So she decided to dress in something other than her widow's clothes and to cover her face with a veil. After this, she sat outside the town of Enaim on the road to Timnah.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">When Judah came along, he did not recognize her because of the veil. He thought she was a prostitute</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">and asked her to sleep with him. She asked, &amp;apos;What will you give me if I do?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">&amp;apos;One of my young goats,&amp;apos; he answered.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">&amp;apos;What do you want?&amp;apos; he asked in return. &amp;apos;The ring on that cord around your neck,&amp;apos; was her reply. &amp;apos;I also want the special walking stick you have with you.&amp;apos; He gave them to her, they slept together, and she became pregnant.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">After returning home, Tamar took off the veil and dressed in her widow's clothes again.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Judah asked his friend Hirah take a goat to the woman, so he could get back the ring and walking stick, but she wasn't there.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Hirah asked the people of Enaim, &amp;apos;Where is the prostitute who sat along the road outside your town?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Hirah went back and told Judah, &amp;apos;I couldn't find the woman, and the people of Enaim said no prostitute had ever been there.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">&amp;apos;If you couldn't find her, we'll just let her keep the things I gave her,&amp;apos; Judah answered. &amp;apos;And we'd better forget about the goat, or else we'll look like fools.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">About three months later someone told Judah, &amp;apos;Your daughter-in-law Tamar has behaved like a prostitute, and now she's pregnant!&amp;apos;</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="9">No one in my master's house is more important than I am. The only thing he hasn't given me is you, and that's because you are his wife. I won't sin against God by doing such a terrible thing as this.&amp;apos;</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="4">They spent a long time in prison, and the official in charge of the palace guard, made Joseph their servant. Joseph replied, &amp;apos;Doesn't God know the meaning of dreams?

The three baskets are three days, Everything happened just as Joseph had said it would,</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1">Two years later the king of Egypt dreamed he was standing beside the Nile River.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Suddenly, seven fat, healthy cows came up from the river and started eating grass along the bank.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Then seven ugly, skinny cows came up out of the river and</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">ate the fat, healthy cows. When this happened, the king woke up. Now I remember what I was supposed to do. I dreamed I was standing on the bank of the Nile River. Your Majesty, both of your dreams mean the same thing, and in them God has shown what he is going to do.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">The king went back to sleep and had another dream. This time seven full heads of grain were growing on a single stalk.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Later, seven other heads of grain appeared, but they were thin and scorched by a wind from the desert.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">The thin heads of grain swallowed the seven full heads. Again the king woke up, and it had only been a dream.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">The next morning the king was upset. So he called in his magicians and wise men and told them what he had dreamed. None of them could tell him what the dreams meant.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">The king's personal servant said:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">When you were angry with me and your chief cook, you threw us both in jail in the house of the captain of the guard.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">One night we both had dreams, and each dream had a different meaning.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">A young Hebrew, who was a servant of the captain of the guard, was there with us at the time. When we told him our dreams, he explained what each of them meant,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">and everything happened just as he said it would. I got my job back, and the cook was put to death.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">The king sent for Joseph, who was quickly brought out of jail. He shaved, changed his clothes, and went to the king.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">The king said to him, &amp;apos;I had a dream, yet no one can explain what it means. I am told that you can interpret dreams.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">&amp;apos;Your Majesty,&amp;apos; Joseph answered, &amp;apos;I can't do it myself, but God can give a good meaning to your dreams.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">The king told Joseph:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">I saw seven fat, healthy cows come up out of the river, and they began feeding on the grass.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Next, seven skinny, bony cows came up out of the river. I have never seen such terrible looking cows anywhere in Egypt.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">The skinny cows ate the fat ones.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">But you couldn't tell it, because these skinny cows were just as skinny as they were before. At once, I woke up.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">I also dreamed that I saw seven heads of grain growing on one stalk. The heads were full and ripe.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">Then seven other heads of grain came up. They were thin and scorched by a wind from the desert.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">These heads of grain swallowed the full ones. I told my dreams to the magicians, but none of them could tell me the meaning of the dreams.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">Joseph replied:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">The seven good cows stand for seven years, and so do the seven good heads of grain.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">The seven skinny, ugly cows that came up later also stand for seven years, as do the seven bad heads of grain that were scorched by the desert wind. The dreams mean there will be seven years when there won't be enough grain.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">It is just as I said&amp;ndash;God has shown what he intends to do.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">For seven years Egypt will have more than enough grain,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">but that will be followed by seven years when there won't be enough. The good years of plenty will be forgotten, and everywhere in Egypt people will be starving.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">The famine will be so bad that no one will remember that once there had been plenty.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">God has given you two dreams to let you know that he has definitely decided to do this and that he will do it soon.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">Your Majesty, you should find someone who is wise and will know what to do, so that you can put him in charge of all Egypt.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">Then appoint some other officials to collect one fifth of every crop harvested in Egypt during the seven years when there is plenty.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">Give them the power to collect the grain during those good years and to store it in your cities.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">It can be stored until it is needed during the seven years when there won't be enough grain in Egypt. This will keep the country from being destroyed because of the lack of food.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">The king and his officials liked this plan.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">So the king said to them, &amp;apos;Who could possibly handle this better than Joseph? After all, the Spirit of God is with him.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">The king told Joseph, &amp;apos;God is the one who has shown you these things. No one else is as wise as you are or knows as much as you do.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">I'm putting you in charge of my palace, and everybody will have to obey you. No one will be over you except me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">You are now governor of all Egypt!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">Then the king took off his royal ring and put it on Joseph's finger. He gave him fine clothes to wear and placed a gold chain around his neck.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43">He also let him ride in the chariot next to his own, and people shouted, &amp;apos;Make way for Joseph!&amp;apos; So Joseph was governor of Egypt.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44">The king told Joseph, &amp;apos;Although I'm king, no one in Egypt is to do anything without your permission.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45">He gave Joseph the Egyptian name Zaphenath Paneah. And he let him marry Asenath, the daughter of Potiphera, a priest in the city of Heliopolis. Joseph traveled all over Egypt.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46">Joseph was 30 when the king made him governor, and he went everywhere for the king.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="47">For seven years there were big harvests of grain.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="48">Joseph collected and stored up the extra grain in the cities of Egypt near the fields where it was harvested.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="49">In fact, there was so much grain that they stopped keeping record, because it was like counting the grains of sand along the beach.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="50">Joseph and his wife had two sons before the famine began.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="51">Their first son was named Manasseh, which means, &amp;apos;God has let me forget all my troubles and my family back home.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="52">His second son was named Ephraim, which means &amp;apos;God has made me a success in the land where I suffered.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="53">Egypt's seven years of plenty came to an end,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="54">and the seven years of famine began, just as Joseph had said. There was not enough food in other countries, but all over Egypt there was plenty.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="55">When the famine finally struck Egypt, the people asked the king for food, but he said, &amp;apos;Go to Joseph and do what he tells you to do.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="56">The famine became bad everywhere in Egypt, so Joseph opened the storehouses and sold the grain to the Egyptians.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="57">People from all over the world came to Egypt to buy grain, because the famine was so severe in their countries.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="42">
			<VERS vnumber="1">When Jacob found out there was grain in Egypt, he said to his sons, &amp;apos;Why are you just sitting here, staring at one another?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">I have heard there is grain in Egypt. Go down and buy some, so we won't starve to death.&amp;apos; &amp;apos;From the land of Canaan,&amp;apos; they answered. &amp;apos;We've come here to buy grain.&amp;apos; It's like I said. You're spies, Since I respect God, I'll give you a chance to save your lives. Joseph's brothers agreed</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Ten of Joseph's brothers went to Egypt to buy grain.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">But Jacob did not send Joseph's younger brother Benjamin with them; he was afraid that something might happen to him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">So Jacob's sons joined others from Canaan who were going to Egypt because of the terrible famine.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Since Joseph was governor of Egypt and in charge of selling grain, his brothers came to him and bowed with their faces to the ground.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Joseph remembered what he had dreamed about them and said, &amp;apos;You're spies! You've come here to find out where our country is weak.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">&amp;apos;No sir,&amp;apos; they replied. &amp;apos;We're your servants, and we have only come to buy grain.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">We're honest men, and we come from the same family&amp;ndash;we're not spies.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">&amp;apos;That isn't so!&amp;apos; Joseph insisted. &amp;apos;You've come here to find out where our country is weak.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">But they explained, &amp;apos;Sir, we come from a family of twelve brothers. The youngest is still with our father in Canaan, and one of our brothers is dead.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Joseph replied:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">and I'm going to find out the truth. I swear by the life of the king that you won't leave this place until your youngest brother comes here.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Choose one of you to go after your brother, while the rest of you stay here in jail. That will show whether you are telling the truth. But if you are lying, I swear by the life of the king that you are spies!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Joseph kept them all under guard for three days,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">before saying to them:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">If you are honest men, one of you must stay here in jail, and the rest of you can take the grain back to your starving families.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">But you must bring your youngest brother to me. Then I'll know that you are telling the truth, and you won't be put to death.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">and said to one another, &amp;apos;We're being punished because of Joseph. We saw the trouble he was in, but we refused to help him when he begged us. That's why these terrible things are happening.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Reuben spoke up, &amp;apos;Didn't I tell you not to harm the boy? But you wouldn't listen, and now we have to pay the price for killing him.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">They did not know that Joseph could understand them, since he was speaking through an interpreter.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">Joseph turned away from them and cried, but soon he turned back and spoke to them again. Then he had Simeon tied up and taken away while they watched.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">Joseph gave orders for his brothers' grain sacks to be filled with grain and for their money to be put in their sacks. He also gave orders for them to be given food for their journey home. After this was done,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">they each loaded the grain on their donkeys and left.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">When they stopped for the night, one of them opened his sack to get some grain for his donkey, and at once he saw his moneybag.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">&amp;apos;Here's my money!&amp;apos; he told his brothers. &amp;apos;Right here in my sack.&amp;apos; They were trembling with fear as they stared at one another and asked themselves, &amp;apos;What has God done to us?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">When they returned to the land of Canaan, they told their father Jacob everything that had happened to them:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">The governor of Egypt was rude and treated us like spies.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">But we told him, &amp;apos;We're honest men, not spies.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">We come from a family of twelve brothers. The youngest is still with our father in Canaan, and the other is dead.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">Then the governor of Egypt told us, &amp;apos;I'll find out if you really are honest. Leave one of your brothers here with me, while you take the grain to your starving families.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">But bring your youngest brother to me, so I can be certain that you are honest men and not spies. After that, I'll let your other brother go free, and you can stay here and trade.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">When the brothers started emptying their sacks of grain, they found their moneybags in them. They were frightened, and so was their father Jacob,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">who said, &amp;apos;You have already taken my sons Joseph and Simeon from me. And now you want to take away Benjamin! Everything is against me.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">Reuben spoke up, &amp;apos;Father, if I don't bring Benjamin back, you can kill both of my sons. Trust me with him, and I'll bring him back.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">But Jacob said, &amp;apos;I won't let my son Benjamin go down to Egypt with the rest of you. His brother is already dead, and he is the only son I have left. I am an old man, and if anything happens to him on the way, I'll die from sorrow, and all of you will be to blame.&amp;apos;</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="43">
			<VERS vnumber="1">The famine in Canaan got worse,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">until finally, Jacob's family had eaten all the grain they had bought in Egypt. So Jacob said to his sons, &amp;apos;Go back and buy some more grain.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Jacob asked, &amp;apos;Why did you cause me so much trouble by telling the governor you had another brother?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">They answered, &amp;apos;He asked a lot of questions about us and our family. He wanted to know if you were still alive and if we had any more brothers. All we could do was answer his questions. How could we know he would tell us to bring along our brother?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Then Judah said to his father, &amp;apos;Let Benjamin go with me, and we will leave at once, so that none of us will starve to death.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">I promise to bring him back safely, and if I don't, you can blame me as long as I live.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">If we had not wasted all this time, we could already have been there and back twice.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Their father said: If Benjamin must go with you, take the governor a gift of some of the best things from our own country, such as perfume, honey, spices, pistachio nuts, and almonds.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Also take along twice the amount of money for the grain, because there must have been some mistake when the money was put back in your sacks.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Take Benjamin with you and leave at once.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">When you go in to see the governor, I pray that God All-Powerful will be good to you and that the governor will let your other brother and Benjamin come back home with you. But if I must lose my children, I suppose I must.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">The brothers took the gifts, twice the amount of money, and Benjamin. Then they hurried off to Egypt. When they stood in front of Joseph,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">he saw Benjamin and told the servant in charge of his house, &amp;apos;Take these men to my house. Slaughter an animal and cook it, so they can eat with me at noon.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">The servant did as he was told and took the brothers to Joseph's house.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">But on the way they got worried and started thinking, &amp;apos;We are being taken there because of the money that was put back in our sacks last time. He will arrest us, make us his slaves, and take our donkeys.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">So when they arrived at Joseph's house, they said to the servant in charge,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">&amp;apos;Sir, we came to Egypt once before to buy grain.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">But when we stopped for the night, we each found in our grain sacks the exact amount we had paid. We have brought that money back,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">together with enough money to buy more grain. We don't know who put the money in our sacks.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">&amp;apos;It's all right,&amp;apos; the servant replied. &amp;apos;Don't worry. The God you and your father worship must have put the money there, because I received your payment in full.&amp;apos; Then he brought Simeon out to them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">The servant took them into Joseph's house and gave them water to wash their feet. He also tended their donkeys.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">The brothers got their gifts ready to give to Joseph at noon, since they had heard they were going to eat there.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">When Joseph came home, they gave him the gifts they had brought, and they bowed down to him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">After Joseph had asked how they were, he said, &amp;apos;What about your elderly father? Is he still alive?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">They answered, &amp;apos;Your servant our father is still alive and well.&amp;apos; And again they bowed down to Joseph.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">When Joseph looked around and saw his brother Benjamin, he said, &amp;apos;This must be your youngest brother, the one you told me about. God bless you, my son.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">Then, because of his love for Benjamin, he rushed off to his room and cried.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">After washing his face and returning, he was able to control himself and said, &amp;apos;Serve the meal!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">Joseph was served at a table by himself, and his brothers were served at another. The Egyptians sat at yet another table, because Egyptians felt it was disgusting to eat with Hebrews.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">To the surprise of Joseph's brothers, they were seated in front of him according to their ages, from the oldest to the youngest.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">They were served food from Joseph's table, and Benjamin was given five times as much as each of the others. So Joseph's brothers ate and drank with him and had a good time.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="44">
			<VERS vnumber="3">Early the next morning, the men were sent on their way with their donkeys.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">But they had not gone far from the city when Joseph told the servant, &amp;apos;Go after those men! When you catch them, say, &amp;quot;My master has been good to you. So why have you stolen his silver cup?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Not only does he drink from his cup, but he also uses it to learn about the future. You have done a terrible thing.&amp;quot; &amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">When the servant caught up with them, he said exactly what Joseph had told him to say.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">But they replied, &amp;apos;Sir, why do you say such things? We would never do anything like that!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">We even returned the money we found in our grain sacks when we got back to Canaan. So why would we want to steal any silver or gold from your master's house?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">If you find that one of us has the cup, then kill him, and the rest of us will become your slaves.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">&amp;apos;Good!&amp;apos; the man replied, &amp;apos;I'll do what you have said. But only the one who has the cup will become my slave. The rest of you can go free.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Each of the brothers quickly put his sack on the ground and opened it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Joseph's servant started searching the sacks, beginning with the one that belonged to the oldest brother. When he came to Benjamin's sack, he found the cup.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">This upset the brothers so much that they began tearing their clothes in sorrow. Then they loaded their donkeys and returned to the city.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">When Judah and his brothers got there, Joseph was still at home. So they bowed down to Joseph,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">who asked them, &amp;apos;What have you done? Didn't you know I could find out?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">&amp;apos;Sir, what can we say?&amp;apos; Judah replied. &amp;apos;How can we say we are innocent, when God has shown we are guilty? And now all of us are your slaves, especially the one who had the cup.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Joseph told them, &amp;apos;I would never punish all of you. Only the one who was caught with the cup will become my slave. The rest of you are free to go home to your father.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Judah went over to Joseph and said: Sir, you have as much power as the king himself, and I am only your slave. Please don't get angry if I speak.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">You asked us if our father was still alive and if we had any more brothers.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">So we told you, &amp;apos;Our father is a very old man. In fact, he was already old when Benjamin was born. Benjamin's brother is dead. Now Benjamin is the only one of the two brothers who is still alive, and our father loves him very much.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">You ordered us to bring him here, so you could see him for yourself.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1">Since Joseph could no longer control his feelings in front of his servants, he sent them out of the room. When he was alone with his brothers, he told them, &amp;apos;I am Joseph.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Then he cried so loudly that the Egyptians heard him and told about it in the king's palace. Yes, I am your brother Joseph, the one you sold into Egypt. Tell your brothers to load their donkeys and return to Canaan.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Joseph asked his brothers if his father was still alive, but they were too frightened to answer.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Joseph told them to come closer to him, and when they did, he said:</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="6">There has already been a famine for two years, and for five more years no one will plow fields or harvest grain.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="8">After all, you weren't really the ones who sent me here&amp;ndash;it was God. He made me the highest official in the king's court and placed me over all Egypt.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1">Jacob packed up everything he owned and left for Egypt. On the way he stopped near the town of Beersheba and offered sacrifices to the God his father Isaac had worshiped.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">That night, God spoke to him in a dream and said, &amp;apos;Jacob! Jacob!&amp;apos; &amp;apos;Here I am,&amp;apos; Jacob answered. Jacob and his wife Leah had a total of 33 children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren, but two of their grandchildren had died in Canaan. Their oldest son Reuben took his sons Hanoch, Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi. Their son Simeon took his sons Jemuel, Jamin, Ohad, Jachin, Zohar, and Shaul, whose mother was a Canaanite. Their son Levi took his sons Gershon, Kohath, and Merari. Their son Judah took his sons Shelah, Perez, and Zerah. Judah's sons Er and Onan had died in Canaan. Judah's son Perez took his sons Hezron and Hamul. Their son Zebulun took his sons Sered, Elon, and Jahleel. Their daughter Dinah also went. Their son Gad took his sons Ziphion, Haggi, Shuni, Ezbon, Eri, Arodi, and Areli. Their son Asher took his sons Imnah, Ishvah, Ishvi, and Beriah, who took his sons, Heber and Malchiel. Serah, the daughter of Asher, also went. Jacob and Rachel's son Benjamin took his sons Bela, Becher, Ashbel, Gera, Naaman, Ehi, Rosh, Muppim, Huppim, and Ard. Their son Dan took his son Hushim. Their son Naphtali took his sons Jahzeel, Guni, Jezer, and Shillem. Joseph wanted them to say this to the king, because the Egyptians did not like to be around anyone who raised sheep.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">God said, &amp;apos;I am God, the same God your father worshiped. Don't be afraid to go to Egypt. I will give you so many descendants that one day they will become a nation.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">I will go with you to Egypt, and later I will bring your descendants back here. Your son Joseph will be at your side when you die.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">Sixty-six members of Jacob's family went to Egypt with him, not counting his daughters-in-law.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="30">Jacob said to Joseph, &amp;apos;Now that I have seen you and know you are still alive, I am ready to die.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">Then Joseph said to his brothers and to everyone who had come with them:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">I will tell him that you are shepherds and that you have brought your sheep, goats, cattle, and everything else you own.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">The king will call you in and ask what you do for a living.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">When he does, be sure to say, &amp;apos;We are shepherds. Our families have always raised sheep.&amp;apos; If you tell him this, he will let you settle in the region of Goshen.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="5">The king said to Joseph, &amp;apos;It's good that your father and brothers have arrived.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">I will let them live anywhere they choose in the land of Egypt, but I suggest that they settle in Goshen, the best part of our land. I would also like for your finest shepherds to watch after my own sheep and goats.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Then Joseph brought his father Jacob and introduced him to the king. Jacob gave the king his blessing,</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="9">Jacob answered, &amp;apos;I have lived only 130 years, and I have had to move from place to place. My parents and my grandparents also had to move from place to place. But they lived much longer, and their life was not as hard as mine.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Then Jacob gave the king his blessing once again and left.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Joseph obeyed the king's orders and gave his father and brothers some of the best land in Egypt near the city of Rameses.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Joseph also provided food for their families.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">The famine was bad everywhere in Egypt and Canaan, and the people were suffering terribly.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">So Joseph sold them the grain that had been stored up, and he put the money in the king's treasury.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">But when everyone had run out of money, the Egyptians came to Joseph and demanded, &amp;apos;Give us more grain! If you don't, we'll soon be dead, because our money's all gone.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">&amp;apos;If you don't have any money,&amp;apos; Joseph answered, &amp;apos;give me your animals, and I'll let you have some grain.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">From then on, they brought him their horses and donkeys and their sheep and goats in exchange for grain.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Then the people came to him and said:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Don't let us starve and our land be ruined. If you'll give us grain to eat and seed to plant, we'll sell ourselves and our land to the king. We'll become his slaves.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">The famine became so severe that Joseph finally bought every piece of land in Egypt for the king</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">and made everyone the king's slaves,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">except the priests. The king gave the priests a regular food allowance, so they did not have to sell their land.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">Then Joseph said to the people, &amp;apos;You and your land now belong to the king. I'm giving you seed to plant,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">but one fifth of your crops must go to the king. You can keep the rest as seed or as food for your families.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">&amp;apos;Sir, you have saved our lives!&amp;apos; they answered. &amp;apos;We are glad to be slaves of the king.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">Then Joseph made a law that one fifth of the harvest would always belong to the king. Only the priests did not lose their land.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">The people of Israel made their home in the land of Goshen, where they became prosperous and had large families.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">Jacob himself lived there for 17 years, before dying at the age of 147.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">When Jacob knew he did not have long to live, he called in Joseph and said, &amp;apos;If you really love me, you must make a solemn promise not to bury me in Egypt.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="31">&amp;apos;Will you give me your word?&amp;apos; Jacob asked.</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="48">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Joseph was told that his father Jacob had become very sick. So Joseph went to see him and took along his two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">When Joseph arrived, someone told Jacob, &amp;apos;Your son Joseph has come to see you.&amp;apos; Jacob sat up in bed, but it took almost all his strength. God All-Powerful appeared to me at Luz in the land of Canaan, where he gave me his blessing Joseph, your two sons Ephraim and Manasseh were born in Egypt, but I accept them as my own, just as Reuben and Simeon are mine. Joseph answered, &amp;apos;They are my sons. God has given them to me here in Egypt.&amp;apos; &amp;apos;Bring them to me,&amp;apos; Jacob said. &amp;apos;I want to give them my blessing.&amp;apos; Joseph brought the boys to him, and he hugged and kissed them. My grandfather Abraham and my father Isaac worshiped the Lord God. He has been with me all my life,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Jacob told Joseph:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">and promised, &amp;apos;I will give you a large family with many descendants that will grow into a nation. And I am giving you this land that will belong to you and your family forever.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Then Jacob went on to say:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Any children you have later will be considered yours, but their inheritance will come from Ephraim and Manasseh.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Unfortunately, your mother Rachel died in Canaan after we had left northern Syria and before we reached Bethlehem. And I had to bury her along the way.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Jacob turned to Joseph and told him, &amp;apos;For many years I thought you were dead and that I would never see you again. But now God has even let me live to see your children.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Then Joseph made his sons move away from Jacob's knees, and Joseph bowed down in front of him with his face to the ground.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">After Joseph got up, he brought his two sons over to Jacob again. He led his younger son Ephraim to the left side of Jacob and his older son Manasseh to the right.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">But before Jacob gave them his blessing, he crossed his arms, putting his right hand on the head of Ephraim and his left hand on the head of Manasseh.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Then he gave Joseph his blessing and said:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">and his angel has kept me safe. Now I pray that he will bless these boys and that my name and the names of Abraham and Isaac will live on because of them. I ask God to give them many children and many descendants as well.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Joseph did not like it when he saw his father place his right hand on the head of the younger son. So he tried to move his father's right hand from Ephraim's head and place it on Manasseh.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Joseph said, &amp;apos;Father, you have made a mistake. This is the older boy. Put your right hand on him.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">But his father said, &amp;apos;Son, I know what I am doing. It's true that Manasseh's family will someday become a great nation. But Ephraim will be even greater than Manasseh, because his descendants will become many great nations.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Jacob told him that in the future the people of Israel would ask God's blessings on one another by saying, &amp;apos;I pray for God to bless you as much as he blessed Ephraim and Manasseh.&amp;apos; Jacob put Ephraim's name first to show that he would be greater than Manasseh.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">After that, Jacob said, &amp;apos;Joseph, you can see that I won't live much longer. But God will be with you and will lead you back to the land he promised our family long ago.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="11">The Egyptians put slave bosses in charge of the people of Israel and tried to wear them down with hard work. Those bosses forced them to build the cities of Pithom and Rameses, where the king could store his supplies.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">But even though the Israelites were mistreated, their families grew larger, and they took over more land. Because of this, the Egyptians feared them worse than before</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="3">
			<VERS vnumber="1">One day, Moses was taking care of the sheep and goats of his father-in-law Jethro, the priest of Midian, and Moses decided to lead them across the desert to Sinai, the holy mountain.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">There an angel of the Lord appeared to him from a burning bush. Moses saw that the bush was on fire, but it was not burning up.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">&amp;apos;This is strange!&amp;apos; he said to himself. &amp;apos;I'll go over and see why the bush isn't burning up.&amp;apos; Moses was afraid to look at God, and so he hid his face. I have seen how my people are suffering as slaves in Egypt, and I have heard them beg for my help because of the way they are being mistreated. I feel sorry for them, I will bring my people out of Egypt into a country where there is a lot of good land, rich with milk and honey. I will give them the land where the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites now live.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">When the Lord saw Moses coming near, he called him by name from the bush, and Moses answered, &amp;apos;Here I am.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">God replied, &amp;apos;Don't come any closer. Take off your sandals&amp;ndash;the ground where you are standing is holy.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">I am the God who was worshiped by your ancestors Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">The Lord said:</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="9">My people have begged for my help, and I have seen how cruel the Egyptians are to them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Now go to the king! I am sending you to lead my people out of his country.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">But Moses said, &amp;apos;Who am I to go to the king and lead your people out of Egypt?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">God replied, &amp;apos;I will be with you. And you will know that I am the one who sent you, when you worship me on this mountain after you have led my people out of Egypt.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Moses answered, &amp;apos;I will tell the people of Israel that the God their ancestors worshiped has sent me to them. But what should I say, if they ask me your name?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Call together the leaders of Israel and tell them that the God who was worshiped by Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob has appeared to you. Tell them I have seen how terribly they are being treated in Egypt,</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="19">But I know that the king of Egypt won't let you go unless something forces him to.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">So I will use my mighty power to perform all kinds of miracles and strike down the Egyptians. Then the king will send you away.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">After I punish the Egyptians, they will be so afraid of you that they will give you anything you want. You are my people, and I will let you take many things with you when you leave the land of Egypt.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Every Israelite woman will go to her Egyptian neighbors or to any Egyptian woman living with them and ask them for gold and silver jewelry and for their finest clothes. The Egyptians will give them to you, and you will put these fine things on your sons and daughters. Carry all this away when you leave Egypt.</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="4">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Moses asked the Lord , &amp;apos;Suppose everyone refuses to listen to my message, and no one believes that you really appeared to me?&amp;apos; &amp;apos;A walking stick,&amp;apos; Moses replied. What about your brother Aaron, the Levite? I know he is a good speaker. He is already on his way here to visit you, and he will be happy to see you again. &amp;apos;All right,&amp;apos; Jethro replied. &amp;apos;I hope all goes well.&amp;apos; When you get to Egypt, go to the king and work the miracles I have shown you. But I will make him so stubborn that he will refuse to let my people go.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">The Lord answered, &amp;apos;What's that in your hand?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">&amp;apos;Throw it down!&amp;apos; the Lord commanded. So Moses threw the stick on the ground. It immediately turned into a snake, and Moses jumped back.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">&amp;apos;Pick it up by the tail!&amp;apos; the Lord told him. And when Moses did this, the snake turned back into a walking stick.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">&amp;apos;Do this,&amp;apos; the Lord said, &amp;apos;and the Israelites will believe that you have seen me, the God who was worshiped by their ancestors Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Next, the Lord commanded Moses, &amp;apos;Put your hand inside your shirt.&amp;apos; Moses obeyed, and when he took it out, his hand had turned white as snow&amp;ndash;like someone with leprosy.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">&amp;apos;Put your hand back inside your shirt,&amp;apos; the Lord told him. Moses did so, and when he took it out again, it was as healthy as the rest of his body.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Moses replied, &amp;apos;I have never been a good speaker. I wasn't one before you spoke to me, and I'm not one now. I am slow at speaking, and I can never think of what to say.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">But the Lord answered, &amp;apos;Who makes people able to speak or makes them deaf or unable to speak? Who gives them sight or makes them blind? Don't you know that I am the one who does these things?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Now go! When you speak, I will be with you and give you the words to say.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Moses begged, &amp;apos; Lord , please send someone else to do it.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">The Lord became angry with Moses and said:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Now take this walking stick and use it to perform miracles.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Moses went to his father-in-law Jethro and asked, &amp;apos;Please let me return to Egypt to see if any of my people are still alive.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">But even before this, the Lord had told Moses, &amp;apos;Leave the land of Midian and return to Egypt. Everyone who wanted to kill you is now dead.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">So Moses put his wife and sons on donkeys and headed for Egypt, holding the walking stick that had the power of God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">On the way the Lord said to Moses:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Then tell him that I have said, &amp;apos;Israel is my first-born son,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">and I commanded you to release him, so he could worship me. But you refused, and now I will kill your first-born son.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">One night while Moses was in camp, the Lord was about to kill him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">But Zipporah circumcised her son with a flint knife. She touched his legs with the skin she had cut off and said, &amp;apos;My dear son, this blood will protect you.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">So the Lord did not harm Moses. Then Zipporah said, &amp;apos;Yes, my dear, you are safe because of this circumcision.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">The Lord sent Aaron to meet Moses in the desert. So Aaron met Moses at Mount Sinai and greeted him with a kiss.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">Moses told Aaron what God had sent him to say; he also told him about the miracles God had given him the power to perform.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">Later they brought together the leaders of Israel,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">and Aaron told them what the Lord had sent Moses to say. Then Moses worked the miracles for the people,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">and everyone believed. They bowed down and worshiped the Lord because they knew that he had seen their suffering and was going to help them.</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="5">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Moses and Aaron went to the king of Egypt and told him, &amp;apos;The Lord God says, &amp;quot;Let my people go into the desert, so they can honor me with a celebration there.&amp;quot; &amp;apos;</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="3">They answered, &amp;apos;The Lord God of the Hebrews has appeared to us. Please let us walk three days into the desert where we can offer sacrifices to him. If you don't, he may strike us down with terrible troubles or with war.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">That same day the king gave orders to his Egyptian slave bosses and to the Israelite men directly in charge of the Israelite slaves. He told them:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Don't give the slaves any more straw to put in their bricks. Force them to find their own straw wherever they can,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">but they must make the same number of bricks as before. They are lazy, or else they would not beg me to let them go and sacrifice to their God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Make them work so hard that they won't have time to listen to these lies.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">The slave bosses and the men in charge of the slaves went out and told them, &amp;apos;The king says he will not give you any more straw.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Go and find your own straw wherever you can, but you must still make as many bricks as before.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">The slaves went all over Egypt, looking for straw.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">But the slave bosses were hard on them and kept saying, &amp;apos;Each day you have to make as many bricks as you did when you were given straw.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">The bosses beat the men in charge of the slaves and said, &amp;apos;Why didn't you force the slaves to make as many bricks yesterday and today as they did before?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Finally, the men in charge of the slaves went to the king and said, &amp;apos;Why are you treating us like this?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">No one brings us any straw, but we are still ordered to make the same number of bricks. We are beaten with whips, and your own people are to blame.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">The king replied, &amp;apos;You are lazy&amp;ndash;nothing but lazy! That's why you keep asking me to let you go and sacrifice to your Lord .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Get back to work! You won't be given straw, but you must still make the same number of bricks.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">The men knew they were in deep trouble when they were ordered to make the same number of bricks each day.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">After they left the king, they went to see Moses and Aaron, who had been waiting for them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Then the men said, &amp;apos;We hope the Lord will punish both of you for making the king and his officials hate us. Now they even have an excuse to kill us.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Moses left them and prayed, &amp;apos;Our Lord , why have you brought so much trouble on your people? Is that why you sent me here?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">Ever since you told me to speak to the king, he has caused nothing but trouble for these people. And you haven't done a thing to help.&amp;apos;</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1">The Lord God told Moses: Soon you will see what I will do to the king. Because of my mighty power, he will let my people go, and he will even chase them out of his country.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="19">You had better give orders for every person and every animal in Egypt to take shelter. If they don't, they will die.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Some of the king's officials were frightened by what the Lord had said, and they hurried off to make sure their slaves and animals were safe.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">But others paid no attention to his threats and left their slaves and animals out in the open.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Then the Lord told Moses, &amp;apos;Stretch your arm toward the sky, so that hailstones will fall on people, animals, and crops in the land of Egypt.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">People, animals, and crops were pounded by the hailstones, and bark was stripped from trees.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">Only Goshen, where the Israelites lived, was safe from the storm.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">The king sent for Moses and Aaron and told them, &amp;apos;Now I have really sinned! My people and I are guilty, and the Lord is right.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">We can't stand any more of this thunder and hail. Please ask the Lord to make it stop. Your people can go&amp;ndash;you don't have to stay in Egypt any longer.&amp;apos;</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="31">Meanwhile, the flax and barley crops had been destroyed by the storm because they were ready to ripen.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">But the wheat crops ripen later, and they were not damaged.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">After Moses left the royal palace and the city, he lifted his arms in prayer to the Lord , and the thunder, hail, and drenching rain stopped.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">When the king realized that the storm was over, he disobeyed once more. He and his officials were so stubborn</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="10">
			<VERS vnumber="1">The Lord said to Moses: Go back to the king. I have made him and his officials stubborn, so that I could work these miracles.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">I did this because I want you to tell your children and your grandchildren about my miracles and about my harsh treatment of the Egyptians. Then all of you will know that I am the Lord . How long will you stubbornly refuse to obey? Release my people so they can worship me. After Moses left the palace,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Moses and Aaron went to the king and told him that the Lord God of the Hebrews had said:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Do this by tomorrow, or I will cover your country with so many locusts</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">that you won't be able to see the ground. Most of your crops were ruined by the hailstones, but these locusts will destroy what little is left, including the trees.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Your palace, the homes of your officials, and all the other houses in Egypt will overflow with more locusts than have ever been seen in this country.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">the king's officials asked, &amp;apos;Your Majesty, how much longer is this man going to be a troublemaker? Why don't you let the people leave, so they can worship the Lord their God? Don't you know that Egypt is a disaster?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">The king had Moses and Aaron brought back, and he said, &amp;apos;All right, you may go and worship the Lord your God. But first tell me who will be going.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">&amp;apos;Everyone, young and old,&amp;apos; Moses answered. &amp;apos;We will even take our sheep, goats, and cattle, because we want to hold a celebration in honor of the Lord .&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">The king replied, &amp;apos;The Lord had better watch over you on the day I let you leave with your families! You're up to no good.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Do you want to worship the Lord ? All right, take only the men and go.&amp;apos; Then Moses and Aaron were chased out of the palace.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">The Lord told Moses, &amp;apos;Stretch your arm toward Egypt. Swarms of locusts will come and eat everything left by the hail.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Moses held out his walking stick, and the Lord sent an east wind that blew across Egypt the rest of the day and all that night. By morning, locusts</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">were swarming everywhere. Never before had there been so many locusts in Egypt, and never again will there be so many.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">The ground was black with locusts, and they ate everything left on the trees and in the fields. Nothing green remained in Egypt&amp;ndash;not a tree or a plant.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">At once the king sent for Moses and Aaron. He told them, &amp;apos;I have sinned against the Lord your God and against you.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="18">Moses left the palace and prayed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Then the Lord sent a strong west wind that swept the locusts into the Red Sea. Not one locust was left anywhere in Egypt,</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="21">The Lord said to Moses, &amp;apos;Stretch your arm toward the sky, and everything will be covered with darkness thick enough to touch.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Moses stretched his arm toward the sky, and Egypt was covered with darkness for three days.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">During that time, the Egyptians could not see each other or leave their homes, but there was light where the Israelites lived.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">The king sent for Moses and told him, &amp;apos;Go worship the Lord ! And take your families with you. Just leave your sheep, goats, and cattle.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">&amp;apos;No!&amp;apos; Moses replied. &amp;apos;You must let us offer sacrifices to the Lord our God,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">and we won't know which animals we will need until we get there. That's why we can't leave even one of them here.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">This time the Lord made the king so stubborn</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">that he said to Moses, &amp;apos;Get out and stay out! If you ever come back, you're dead!&amp;apos;</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1">The Lord said to Moses: I am going to punish the king of Egypt and his people one more time. Then the king will gladly let you leave his land. In fact, he will even chase you out.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Now go and tell my people to ask their Egyptian neighbors for gold and silver jewelry. I have come to let you know what the Lord is going to do. About midnight he will go through the land of Egypt, Moses was very angry; he turned and left the king.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">So the Lord made the Egyptians greatly respect the Israelites, and everyone, including the king's officials, considered Moses an important leader.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Moses went to the king and said:</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="6">Everywhere in Egypt there will be loud crying. Nothing like this has ever happened before or will ever happen again.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">But there won't be any need for the Israelites to cry. Things will be so quiet that not even a dog will be heard barking. Then you Egyptians will know that the Lord is good to the Israelites, even while he punishes you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Your leaders will come and bow down, begging me to take my people and leave your country. Then we will leave.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">What the Lord had earlier said to Moses came true. He had said, &amp;apos;The king of Egypt won't listen. Then I will perform even more miracles.&amp;apos;</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="12">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Some time later the Lord said to Moses and Aaron: Each family is to pick out a sheep and kill it for Passover. After Moses finished speaking, the people of Israel knelt down and worshiped the Lord . Only Israelites may eat the Passover meal. No bones of the Passover lamb may be broken.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">This month is to be the first month of the year for you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Tell the people of Israel that on the tenth day of this month the head of each family must choose a lamb or a young goat for his family to eat.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="7">Some of the blood must be put on the two doorposts and above the door of each house where the animals are to be eaten.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">That night the animals are to be roasted and eaten, together with bitter herbs and thin bread made without yeast.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Don't eat the meat raw or boiled. The entire animal, including its head, legs, and insides, must be roasted.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Eat what you want that night, and the next morning burn whatever is left.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">When you eat the meal, be dressed and ready to travel. Have your sandals on, carry your walking stick in your hand, and eat quickly. This is the Passover Festival in honor of me, your Lord .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">That same night I will pass through Egypt and kill the first-born son in every family and the first-born male of all animals. I am the Lord , and I will punish the gods of Egypt.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">The blood on the houses will show me where you live, and when I see the blood, I will pass over you. Then you won't be bothered by the terrible disasters I will bring on Egypt.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Remember this day and celebrate it each year as a festival in my honor.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">For seven days you must eat bread made without yeast. And on the first of these seven days, you must remove all yeast from your homes. If you eat anything made with yeast during this festival, you will no longer be part of Israel.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Meet together for worship on the first and seventh days of the festival. The only work you are allowed to do on either of these two days is that of preparing the bread.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Celebrate this Festival of Thin Bread as a way of remembering the day that I brought your families and tribes out of Egypt. And do this each year.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Begin on the evening of the fourteenth day of the first month by eating bread made without yeast. Then continue this celebration until the evening of the twenty-first day.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">During these seven days no yeast is allowed in anyone's home, whether they are native Israelites or not. If you are caught eating anything made with yeast, you will no longer be part of Israel.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Stay away from yeast, no matter where you live. No one is allowed to eat anything made with yeast!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Moses called the leaders of Israel together and said:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Make a brush from a few small branches of a hyssop plant and dip the brush in the bowl that has the blood of the animal in it. Then brush some of the blood above the door and on the posts at each side of the door of your house. After this, everyone is to stay inside until morning.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">During that night the Lord will go through the country of Egypt and kill the first-born son in every Egyptian family. He will see where you have put the blood, and he will not come into your house. His angel that brings death will pass over and not kill your first-born sons.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">Your children will ask you, &amp;apos;What are we celebrating?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">And you will answer, &amp;apos;The Passover animal is killed to honor the Lord . We do these things because on that night long ago the Lord passed over the homes of our people in Egypt. He killed the first-born sons of the Egyptians, but he spared our children from death.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">Then they left and did what Moses and Aaron had told them to do.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">At midnight the Lord killed the first-born son of every Egyptian family, from the son of the king to the son of every prisoner in jail. He also killed the first-born male of every animal that belonged to the Egyptians.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">That night the king, his officials, and everyone else in Egypt got up and started crying bitterly. In every Egyptian home, someone was dead.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">During the night the king sent for Moses and Aaron and told them, &amp;apos;Get your people out of my country and leave us alone! Go and worship the Lord , as you have asked.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">Take your sheep, goats, and cattle, and get out. But ask your God to be kind to me.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">The Egyptians did everything they could to get the Israelites to leave their country as quickly as possible. They said, &amp;apos;Please hurry and leave. If you don't, we will all be dead.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">So the Israelites quickly made some bread dough and put it in pans. But they did not mix any yeast in the dough to make it rise. They wrapped cloth around the pans and carried them on their shoulders.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">The Israelites had already done what Moses had told them to do. They had gone to their Egyptian neighbors and asked for gold and silver and for clothes.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">The Lord had made the Egyptians friendly toward the people of Israel, and they gave them whatever they asked for. In this way they carried away the wealth of the Egyptians when they left Egypt.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">The Israelites walked from the city of Rameses to the city of Succoth. There were about 600,000 of them, not counting women and children.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">Many other people went with them as well, and there were also a lot of sheep, goats, and cattle.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">They left Egypt in such a hurry that they did not have time to prepare any food except the bread dough made without yeast. So they baked it and made thin bread.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">On that night the Lord kept watch for them, and on this same night each year Israel will always keep watch in honor of the Lord .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43">The Lord gave Moses and Aaron the following instructions for celebrating Passover:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44">Your slaves may eat the meal if they have been circumcised,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45">but no foreigners who work for you are allowed to have any.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46">The entire meal must be eaten inside, and no one may leave the house during the celebration.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="47">And all Israelites must take part in the meal.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="48">If anyone who isn't an Israelite wants to celebrate Passover with you, every man and boy in that family must first be circumcised. Then they may join in the meal, just like native Israelites. No uncircumcised man or boy may eat the Passover meal!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="49">This law applies both to native Israelites and to those foreigners who live among you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="50">The Israelites obeyed everything the Lord had commanded Moses and Aaron to tell them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="51">And on that same day the Lord brought Israel's families and tribes out of Egypt.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="13">
			<VERS vnumber="1">The Lord said to Moses,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">&amp;apos;Dedicate to me the first-born son of every family and the first-born males of your flocks and herds. These belong to me.&amp;apos; Each year during the month of Abib, celebrate these events in the following way: The Israelites left Egypt, prepared for battle.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">The Lord promised your ancestors that he would bring you into the land of the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Hivites, and Jebusites. It is a land rich with milk and honey.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">For seven days you are to eat bread made without yeast, and on the seventh day you are to celebrate a festival in honor of the Lord .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">During those seven days, you must not eat anything made with yeast or even have yeast anywhere near your homes.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Then on the seventh day you must explain to your children that you do this because the Lord brought you out of Egypt.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">This celebration will be like wearing a sign on your hand or on your forehead, because then you will pass on to others the teaching of the Lord , whose mighty power brought you out of Egypt.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Celebrate this festival each year at the same time.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">The Lord will give you the land of the Canaanites, just as he promised you and your ancestors.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">From then on, you must give him every first-born son from your families and every first-born male from your animals, because these belong to him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">You can spare the life of a first-born donkey by sacrificing a lamb; if you don't, you must break the donkey's neck. You must spare every first-born son.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">In the future your children will ask what this ceremony means. Explain it to them by saying, &amp;apos;The Lord used his mighty power to rescue us from slavery in Egypt.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">The king stubbornly refused to set us free, so the Lord killed the first-born male of every animal and the first-born son of every Egyptian family. This is why we sacrifice to the Lord every first-born male of every animal and save every first-born son.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">This ceremony will serve the same purpose as a sign on your hand or on your forehead to tell how the Lord 's mighty power rescued us from Egypt.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">After the king had finally let the people go, the Lord did not lead them through Philistine territory, though that was the shortest way. God had said, &amp;apos;If they are attacked, they may decide to return to Egypt.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">So he led them around through the desert and toward the Red Sea.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Moses had them take the bones of Joseph, whose dying words had been, &amp;apos;God will come to your rescue, and when he does, be sure to take my bones with you.&amp;apos;</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="11">They also complained to Moses, &amp;apos;Wasn't there enough room in Egypt to bury us? Is that why you brought us out here to die in the desert? Why did you bring us out of Egypt anyway?</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="9">Moses turned to Aaron and said, &amp;apos;Bring the people together, because the Lord has heard their complaints.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Aaron was speaking to them, when everyone looked out toward the desert and saw the bright glory of the Lord in a cloud.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">The Lord said to Moses,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">&amp;apos;I have heard my people complain. Now tell them that each evening they will have meat and each morning they will have more than enough bread. Then they will know that I am the Lord their God.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">That evening a lot of quails came and landed everywhere in the camp, and the next morning dew covered the ground.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">After the dew had gone, the desert was covered with thin flakes that looked like frost.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">The people had never seen anything like this, and they started asking each other, &amp;apos;What is it?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">And he orders you to gather about two liters for each person in your family&amp;ndash;that should be more than enough.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">They did as they were told. Some gathered more and some gathered less.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Everyone had exactly what they needed, just the right amount.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Moses told them not to keep any overnight.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Some of them disobeyed, but the next morning what they kept was stinking and full of worms, and Moses was angry.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Each morning everyone gathered as much as they needed, and in the heat of the day the rest melted.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">However, on the sixth day of the week, everyone gathered enough to have four liters, instead of two. When the leaders reported this to Moses,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">he told them that the Lord had said, &amp;apos;Tomorrow is the Sabbath, a sacred day of rest in honor of me. So gather all you want to bake or boil, and make sure you save enough for tomorrow.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">The people obeyed, and the next morning the food smelled fine and had no worms.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">&amp;apos;You may eat the food,&amp;apos; Moses said. &amp;apos;Today is the Sabbath in honor of the Lord , and there won't be any of this food on the ground today.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">You will find it there for the first six days of the week, but not on the Sabbath.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">A few of the Israelites did go out to look for some, but there was none.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">Then the Lord said, &amp;apos;Moses, how long will you people keep disobeying my laws and teachings?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">Remember that I was the one who gave you the Sabbath. That's why on the sixth day I provide enough bread for two days. Everyone is to stay home and rest on the Sabbath.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">And so they rested on the Sabbath.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">The Israelites called the bread manna. It was white like coriander seed and delicious as wafers made with honey.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">Moses told the people that the Lord had said, &amp;apos;Store up two liters of this manna, because I want future generations to see the food I gave you during the time you were in the desert after I rescued you from Egypt.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">Then Moses told Aaron, &amp;apos;Put some manna in a jar and store it in the place of worship for future generations to see.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">Aaron followed the Lord 's instructions and put the manna in front of the sacred chest for safekeeping.</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="17">
			<VERS vnumber="1">The Israelites left the desert and moved from one place to another each time the Lord ordered them to. Once they camped at Rephidim, but there was no water for them to drink. Moses replied, &amp;apos;Why are you complaining to me and trying to put the Lord to the test?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">The people started complaining to Moses, &amp;apos;Give us some water!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">But the people were thirsty and kept on complaining, &amp;apos;Moses, did you bring us out of Egypt just to let us and our families and our animals die of thirst?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Then Moses prayed to the Lord , &amp;apos;What am I going to do with these people? They are about to stone me to death!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">The Lord answered, &amp;apos;Take some of the leaders with you and go ahead of the rest of the people. Also take along the walking stick with which you struck the Nile River.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">When you get to the rock at Mount Sinai, I will be there with you. Strike the rock with the stick, and water will pour out for the people to drink.&amp;apos; Moses did this while the leaders watched.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">The people had complained and tested the Lord by asking, &amp;apos;Is the Lord really with us?&amp;apos; So Moses named that place Massah, which means &amp;apos;testing&amp;apos; and Meribah, which means &amp;apos;complaining.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">When the Israelites were at Rephidim, they were attacked by the Amalekites.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">So Moses told Joshua, &amp;apos;Have some men ready to attack the Amalekites tomorrow. I will stand on a hilltop, holding this walking stick that has the power of God.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Joshua led the attack as Moses had commanded, while Moses, Aaron, and Hur stood on the hilltop.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">The Israelites out-fought the Amalekites as long as Moses held up his arms, but they started losing whenever he lowered them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">After a while, his arms were so tired that Aaron and Hur got a rock for him to sit on. Then they stood beside him and supported his arms in the same position until sunset.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">That's how Joshua defeated the Amalekites.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Afterwards, the Lord said to Moses, &amp;apos;Write an account of this victory and read it to Joshua. I want the Amalekites to be forgotten forever.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Moses built an altar and named it &amp;apos;The Lord Gives Me Victory.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Then Moses explained, &amp;apos;This is because I depended on the Lord . But in future generations, the Lord will fight the Amalekites again and again.&amp;apos;</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="18">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Jethro was the priest of Midian and the father-in-law of Moses. He heard what the Lord God had done for Moses and his people, after rescuing them from Egypt. That isn't the best way to do it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">When they arrived, Moses went out and bowed down in front of Jethro, then kissed him. After they had greeted each other, they went into the tent,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">where Moses told him everything the Lord had done to protect Israel against the Egyptians and their king. He also told him how the Lord had helped them in all of their troubles.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Jethro was so pleased to hear this good news about what the Lord had done,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">that he shouted, &amp;apos;Praise the Lord ! He rescued you and the Israelites from the Egyptians and their king.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Now I know that the Lord is the greatest God, because he has rescued Israel from their arrogant enemies.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Jethro offered sacrifices to God. Then Aaron and Israel's leaders came to eat with Jethro there at the place of worship.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">The next morning Moses sat down at the place where he decided legal cases for the people, and everyone crowded around him until evening.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Jethro saw how much Moses had to do for the people, and he asked, &amp;apos;Why are you the only judge? Why do you let these people crowd around you from morning till evening?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Moses answered, &amp;apos;Because they come here to find out what God wants them to do.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">They bring their complaints to me, and I make decisions on the basis of God's laws.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Jethro replied:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">You and the people who come to you will soon be worn out. The job is too much for one person; you can't do it alone.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">God will help you if you follow my advice. You should be the one to speak to God for the people,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">and you should teach them God's laws and show them what they must do to live right.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">You will need to appoint some competent leaders who respect God and are trustworthy and honest. Then put them over groups of 10, 50, 100, and 1,000.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">These judges can handle the ordinary cases and bring the more difficult ones to you. Having them to share the load will make your work easier.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">This is the way God wants it done. You won't be under nearly as much stress, and everyone else will return home feeling satisfied.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">Moses followed Jethro's advice.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">He chose some competent leaders from every tribe in Israel and put them over groups of 10, 50, 100, and 1,000.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">They served as judges, deciding the easy cases themselves, but bringing the more difficult ones to Moses.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="3">Moses went up the mountain to meet with the Lord God, who told him to say to the people:</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="5">Now if you will faithfully obey me, you will be my very own people. The whole world is mine,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">but you will be my holy nation and serve me as priests.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">After Moses went back, he reported to the leaders what the Lord had said,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">and they all promised, &amp;apos;We will do everything the Lord has commanded.&amp;apos; So Moses told the Lord about this.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">The Lord said to Moses, &amp;apos;I will come to you in a thick cloud and let the people hear me speak to you. Then they will always trust you.&amp;apos; Again Moses reported to the Lord what the people had said.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Once more the Lord spoke to Moses:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">and be ready by the day after tomorrow, when I will come down to Mount Sinai, where all of them can see me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Warn the people that they are forbidden to touch any part of the mountain. Anyone who does will be put to death,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">either with stones or arrows, and no one must touch the body of the person being put to death in this way. Even an animal that touches this mountain must be put to death. You may go up the mountain only after a signal is given on the trumpet.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">After Moses went down the mountain, he gave orders for the people to wash their clothes and make themselves acceptable to worship God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">He told them to be ready in three days and not to have sex in the meantime.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">On the morning of the third day there was thunder and lightning. A thick cloud covered the mountain, a loud trumpet blast was heard, and everyone in camp trembled with fear.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Moses led them out of the camp to meet God, and they stood at the foot of the mountain.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Mount Sinai was covered with smoke because the Lord had come down in a flaming fire. Smoke poured out of the mountain just like a furnace, and the whole mountain shook.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">The trumpet blew louder and louder. Moses spoke, and God answered him with thunder.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">The Lord came down to the top of Mount Sinai and told Moses to meet him there.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Then he said, &amp;apos;Moses, go and warn the people not to cross the boundary that you set at the foot of the mountain. They must not cross it to come and look at me, because if they do, many of them will die.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Only the priests may come near me, and they must obey strict rules before I let them. If they don't, they will be punished.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">Moses replied, &amp;apos;The people cannot come up the mountain. You warned us to stay away because it is holy.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">Then the Lord told Moses, &amp;apos;Go down and bring Aaron back here with you. But the priests and people must not try to push their way through, or I will rush at them like a flood!&amp;apos;</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="2">If you buy a Hebrew slave, he must remain your slave for six years. But in the seventh year you must set him free, without cost to him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">If he was single at the time you bought him, he alone must be set free. But if he was married at the time, both he and his wife must be given their freedom.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">If you give him a wife, and they have children, only the man himself must be set free; his wife and children remain the property of his owner.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">But suppose the slave loves his wife and children and his owner so much that he won't leave them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Then he must stand beside either the door or the doorpost at the place of worship, while his owner punches a small hole through one of his ears with a sharp metal rod. This makes him a slave for life.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">A young woman who was sold by her father doesn't gain her freedom in the same way that a man does.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">If she doesn't please the man who bought her to be his wife, he must let her be bought back. He cannot sell her to foreigners; this would break the contract he made with her.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">If he selects her as a wife for his son, he must treat her as his own daughter.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">If the man later marries another woman, he must continue to provide food and clothing for the one he bought and to treat her as a wife.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">If he fails to do any of these things, she must be given her freedom without paying for it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Death is the punishment for murder.</VERS>

Those people you led out of Egypt are acting like fools. Our Lord , you used your mighty power to bring these people out of Egypt. Now don't become angry and destroy them. Don't be angry with me. You know as well as I do that they are determined to do evil. Then the men of the Levi tribe gathered around Moses,</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="20">He melted the idol the people had made, and he ground it into powder. He scattered it in their water and made them drink it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Moses asked Aaron, &amp;apos;What did these people do to harm you? Why did you make them sin in this terrible way?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Aaron answered:</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="24">Then I asked them to bring me their gold earrings. They took them off and gave them to me. I threw the gold into a fire, and out came this bull.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">Moses knew that the people were out of control and that it was Aaron's fault. And now they had made fools of themselves in front of their enemies.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="8">Each time Moses went out to this tent, everyone would stand at the entrance to their own tents and watch him enter.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Moses said to the Lord , &amp;apos;I know that you have told me to lead these people to the land you promised them. But you have not said who will go along to help me. You have said that you are my friend and that you are pleased with me.</VERS>

I promise to perform miracles for you that have never been seen anywhere on earth. Neighboring nations will stand in fear and know that I was the one who did these marvelous things. Bring an offering every time you come to worship. Don't boil a young goat in its mother's milk.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1">The people of Israel had left Egypt and were living in the Sinai Desert. Then on the first day of the second month of the second year, when Moses was in the sacred tent the Lord said: Elizur son of Shedeur from Reuben, Shelumiel son of Zurishaddai from Simeon, Nahshon son of Amminadab from Judah, Nethanel son of Zuar from Issachar, Eliab son of Helon from Zebulun, Elishama son of Ammihud from Ephraim, Gamaliel son of Pedahzur from Manasseh, Abidan son of Gideoni from Benjamin, Ahiezer son of Ammishaddai from Dan, Pagiel son of Ochran from Asher, Eliasaph son of Deuel from Gad, and Ahira son of Enan from Naphtali. 46,500 from Reuben, 59,300 from Simeon, 45,650 from Gad, 74,600 from Judah, 54,400 from Issachar, 57,400 from Zebulun, 40,500 from Ephraim, 32,200 from Manasseh, 35,400 from Benjamin, 62,700 from Dan, 41,500 from Asher, 53,400 from Naphtali. The total number of men registered by Moses, Aaron, and the twelve leaders was 603,550.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">called together the people that same day. They were counted according to their clans and families. Then Moses and the others listed the names of the men twenty years and older,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">just as the Lord had commanded.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="47">But those from the Levi tribe were not included</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="48">because the Lord had said to Moses:</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="52">The rest of the Israelites will camp in their own groups and under their own banners.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="53">But the Levites will camp around the sacred tent to make sure that no one goes near it and makes me furious with the Israelites.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="54">The people of Israel did everything the Lord had commanded.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="2">
			<VERS vnumber="1">The Lord told Moses and Aaron</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">how the Israelites should arrange their camp: Each tribe must set up camp under its own banner and under the flags of its ancestral families. These camps will be arranged around the sacred tent, but not close to it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">These 186,400 troops will march into battle first.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">These 151,450 troops will march into battle second.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Marching behind Reuben will be the Levites, arranged in groups, just as they are camped. They will carry the sacred tent and their own banners.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="31">These 157,600 troops will march into battle last.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">So all the Israelites in the camp were counted according to their ancestral families. The troops were arranged by divisions and totaled 603,550.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">The only Israelites not included were the Levites, just as the Lord had commanded Moses.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">Israel did everything the Lord had told Moses. They arranged their camp according to clans and families, with each tribe under its own banner. And that was the order by which they marched into battle.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1">When the Lord talked with Moses on Mount Sinai,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Aaron's four sons, Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">were the ones to be ordained as priests.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">But the Lord killed Nadab and Abihu in the Sinai Desert when they used fire that was unacceptable in their offering to the Lord . And because Nadab and Abihu had no sons, only Eleazar and Ithamar served as priests with their father Aaron.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">The Lord said to Moses:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Assign the Levi tribe to Aaron the priest. They will be his assistants</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">and will work at the sacred tent for him and for all the Israelites.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">The Levites will serve the community by being responsible for the furnishings of the tent.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">They are assigned to help Aaron and his sons,</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="14">In the Sinai Desert the Lord said to Moses,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">&amp;apos;Now I want you to count the men and boys in the Levi tribe by families and by clans. Include every one at least a month old.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">So Moses obeyed and counted them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Levi's three sons, Gershon, Kohath, and Merari, had become the heads of their own clans.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Gershon's sons were Libni and Shimei.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Kohath's sons were Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">And Merari's sons were Mahli and Mushi. These were the sons and grandsons of Levi, and they had become the leaders of the Levite clans.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">The two Gershon clans were the Libnites and Shimeites,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">and they had 7,500 men and boys at least one month old.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">Their duties at the tent included taking care of the tent itself, along with its outer covering, the curtain for the entrance,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">the curtains hanging inside the courtyard around the tent, as well as the curtain and ropes for the entrance to the courtyard and its altar. The Gershonites were responsible for setting these things up and taking them down.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">The four Kohath clans were the Amramites, Izharites, Hebronites, and the Uzzielites,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">and they had 8,600 men and boys at least one month old.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">Their duties at the tent included taking care of the sacred chest, the table for the sacred bread, the lampstand, the altars, the objects used for worship, and the curtain in front of the most holy place. The Kohathites were responsible for setting these things up and taking them down.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">Eleazar son of Aaron was the head of the Levite leaders, and he made sure that the work at the sacred tent was done.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">The two Merari clans were the Mahlites and the Mushites,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">and they had 6,200 men and boys at least one month old.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">The Merarites, under the leadership of Zuriel son of Abihail, were to camp on the north side of the sacred tent.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">Moses, Aaron, and his sons were to camp in front of the sacred tent, on the east side, and to make sure that the Israelites worshiped in the proper way. Anyone else who tried to do the work of Moses and Aaron was to be put to death.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">So Moses and Aaron obeyed the Lord and counted the Levites by their clans. The total number of Levites at least one month old was 22,000.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">The Lord said to Moses, &amp;apos;Make a list and count the first-born sons at least one month old in each of the Israelite families.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">They belong to me, but I will accept the Levites as substitutes for them, and I will accept the Levites' livestock as substitutes for the Israelites' first-born livestock.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">Moses obeyed the Lord and counted the first-born sons;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43">there were 22,273 of them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44">Then the Lord said,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45">&amp;apos;The Levites will belong to me and will take the place of the first-born sons; their livestock will take the place of the Israelites' first-born livestock.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46">But since there are more first-born sons than Levites, the extra 273 men and boys must be bought back from me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="47">For each one, you are to collect five pieces of silver, weighed according to the official standards.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="48">This money must then be given to Aaron and his sons.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="49">Moses collected the silver from the extra 273 first-born men and boys,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="50">and it amounted to 1,365 pieces of silver, weighed according to the official standards.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="51">Then he gave it to Aaron and his sons, just as the Lord had commanded.</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="4">
			<VERS vnumber="1">The Lord told Moses and Aaron: Moses, find out how many men between 30 and 50 are in the two Levite clans of Merari, but count only those who are able to work at the sacred tent.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="5">When the Israelites are ready to move their camp, Aaron and his sons will enter the tent and take down the curtain that separates the sacred chest from the rest of the tent. They will cover the chest with this curtain,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">and then with a piece of fine leather, and cover it all with a solid blue cloth. After this they will put the carrying poles in place.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Next, Aaron and his sons will use another blue cloth to cover the table for the sacred bread. On the cloth they will place the dishes, the bowls for incense, the cups, the jugs for wine, as well as the bread itself.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">They are to cover all of this with a bright red cloth, and then with a piece of fine leather, before putting the carrying poles in place.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">With another blue cloth they will cover the lampstand, along with the lamps, the lamp snuffers, the fire pans, and the jars of oil for the lamps.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">All of this will then be covered with a piece of fine leather and placed on a carrying frame.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">The gold incense altar is to be covered with a blue cloth, and then with a piece of fine leather, before its carrying poles are put in place.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Next, Aaron and his sons will take blue cloth and wrap all the objects used in worship at the sacred tent. These will need to be covered with a piece of fine leather, then placed on a carrying frame.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">They are to remove the ashes from the bronze altar and cover it with a purple cloth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">On that cloth will be placed the utensils used at the altar, including the fire pans, the meat forks, the shovels, and the sprinkling bowls. All of this will then be covered with a piece of fine leather, before the carrying poles are put in place.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">When the camp is ready to be moved, the Kohathites will be responsible for carrying the sacred objects and the furnishings of the sacred tent. But Aaron and his sons must have already covered those things so the Kohathites won't touch them and die.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Eleazar son of Aaron the priest will be in charge of the oil for the lamps, the sweet-smelling incense, the grain for the sacrifices, and the olive oil used for dedications and ordinations. Eleazar is responsible for seeing that the sacred tent, its furnishings, and the sacred objects are taken care of.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">The Lord said to Moses:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">The Gershonites will be responsible</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">for carrying the curtains of the sacred tent, its two outer coverings, the curtain for the entrance to the tent,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">the curtains hanging around the courtyard of the tent, and the curtain and ropes for the entrance to the courtyard. The Gershonites are to do whatever needs to be done to take care of these things,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">and they will carry them wherever Aaron and his sons tell them to.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">These are the duties of the Gershonites at the sacred tent, and Ithamar son of Aaron will make sure they do their work.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">The Merarites will be responsible for carrying the frames of the tent and its other pieces, including the bars, the posts, and the stands,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">as well as the posts that support the courtyard, together with their stands, tent pegs, and ropes. The Merarites are to be told exactly what objects they are to carry,</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="9">Then you, Moses, will call together all the people of Israel and send the Levites to my sacred tent,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">where the people will place their hands on them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Aaron will present the Levites to me as a gift from the people, so that the Levites will do my work.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">After this, the Levites are to place their hands on the heads of the bulls. Sacrifice one of the bulls for the forgiveness of sin, and the other to make sure that I am pleased. Then the Levites will be acceptable to me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">They will stand at my altar in front of Aaron and his sons, who will dedicate the Levites to me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">This ceremony will show that the Levites are different from the other Israelites and belong to me in a special way.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">After they have been made acceptable and have been dedicated, they will be allowed to work at my sacred tent.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">They are mine and will take the place of the first-born Israelite sons.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">When I killed the oldest sons of the Egyptians, I decided that the first-born sons in each Israelite family would be mine, as well as every first-born male from their flocks and herds.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">But now I have chosen these Levites as substitutes for the first-born sons,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">and I have given them as gifts to Aaron and his sons to serve at the sacred tent. I will hold them responsible for what happens to anyone who gets too close to the sacred tent.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Moses, Aaron, and the other Israelites made sure that the Levites did everything the Lord had commanded.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">The Levites sprinkled themselves with the water of forgiveness and washed their clothes. Then Aaron brought them to the altar and offered sacrifices to forgive their sins and make them acceptable to the Lord .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">After this, the Levites worked at the sacred tent as assistants to Aaron and his sons, just as the Lord had commanded.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">The Lord also told Moses,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">They may help the other Levites in their duties, but they must no longer be responsible for any work themselves. Remember this when you assign their duties.&amp;apos;</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1">During the first month of Israel's second year in the Sinai Desert, the Lord had told Moses</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="6">Some people in Israel's camp had touched a dead body and had become unfit to worship the Lord , and they could not celebrate Passover. But they asked Moses and Aaron,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">&amp;apos;Even though we have touched a dead body, why can't we celebrate Passover and offer sacrifices to the Lord at the same time as everyone else?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Moses said, &amp;apos;Wait here while I go into the sacred tent and find out what the Lord says about this.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">The Lord then told Moses</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">to say to the community of Israel:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">But it must be done in the second month, in the evening of the fourteenth day. Eat the Passover lamb with thin bread and bitter herbs,</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="13">But if any of you are fit to worship me, and yet refuse to celebrate Passover when you are not away on a journey, you will no longer belong to my people. You will be punished because you did not offer sacrifices to me at the proper time.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Anyone, including foreigners who live among you, can celebrate Passover, if they follow all the regulations.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">They obeyed the Lord 's commands and went wherever he directed Moses.</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="10">
			<VERS vnumber="1">The Lord told Moses:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Have someone make two trumpets out of hammered silver. These will be used to call the people together and to give the signal for moving your camp.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">If both trumpets are blown, everyone is to meet with you at the entrance to the sacred tent.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">But if just one is blown, only the twelve tribal leaders need to come together.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">But when you want everyone to come together, sound a different signal on the trumpet.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">The priests of Aaron's family will be the ones to blow the trumpets, and this law will never change.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Whenever you go into battle against an enemy attacking your land, give a warning signal on the trumpets. Then I, the Lord , will hear it and rescue you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">During the celebration of the New Moon Festival and other religious festivals, sound the trumpets while you offer sacrifices. This will be a reminder that I am the Lord your God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">On the twentieth day of the second month of that same year, the cloud over the sacred tent moved on.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">So the Israelites broke camp and left the Sinai Desert. And some time later, the cloud stopped in the Paran Desert.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">This was the first time the Lord had told Moses to command the people of Israel to move on.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Judah and the tribes that camped alongside it marched out first, carrying their banner. Nahshon son of Amminadab was the leader of the Judah tribe,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Nethanel son of Zuar was the leader of the Issachar tribe,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">and Eliab son of Helon was the leader of the Zebulun tribe.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="18">Reuben and the tribes that camped alongside it marched out second, carrying their banner. Elizur son of Shedeur was the leader of the Reuben tribe,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Shelumiel son of Zurishaddai was the leader of the Simeon tribe,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">and Eliasaph son of Deuel was the leader of the Gad tribe.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Next were the Kohathites, carrying the objects for the sacred tent, which was to be set up before they arrived at the new camp.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Ephraim and the tribes that camped alongside it marched next, carrying their banner. Elishama son of Ammihud was the leader of the Ephraim tribe,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">Gamaliel son of Pedahzur was the leader of the Manasseh tribe,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">and Abidan son of Gideoni was the leader of the Benjamin tribe.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">Dan and the tribes that camped alongside it were to protect the Israelites against an attack from behind, and so they marched last, carrying their banner. Ahiezer son of Ammishaddai was the leader of the tribe of Dan,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">Pagiel son of Ochran was the leader of the Asher tribe,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">and Ahira son of Enan was the leader of the Naphtali tribe.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="30">&amp;apos;No, I won't go,&amp;apos; Hobab answered. &amp;apos;I'm returning home to be with my own people.&amp;apos;</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="33">The people of Israel began their journey from Mount Sinai. They traveled three days, and the Levites who carried the sacred chest led the way, so the Lord could show them where to camp.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="35">Each day as the Israelites began their journey, Moses would pray, &amp;apos;Our Lord , defeat your enemies and make them run!&amp;apos;</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="11">
			<VERS vnumber="1">One day the Israelites started complaining about their troubles. The Lord heard them and became so angry that he destroyed the outer edges of their camp with fire. I am your servant, Lord , so why are you doing this to me? What have I done to deserve this? You've made me responsible for all these people, Choose 70 of Israel's respected leaders and go with them to the sacred tent.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">When the people begged Moses to help, he prayed, and the fire went out.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">They named the place &amp;apos;Burning,&amp;apos; because in his anger the Lord had set their camp on fire.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">One day some foreigners among the Israelites became greedy for food, and even the Israelites themselves began moaning, &amp;apos;We don't have any meat!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">In Egypt we could eat all the fish we wanted, and there were cucumbers, melons, all kinds of onions, and garlic.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">But we're starving out here, and the only food we have is this manna.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">The manna was like small whitish seeds</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">The Israelites stood around their tents complaining. Moses heard them and was upset that they had made the Lord angry.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">He prayed:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">but they're not my children. You told me to nurse them along and to carry them to the land you promised their ancestors.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">They keep whining for meat, but where can I get meat for them?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">This job is too much for me. How can I take care of all these people by myself?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">If this is the way you're going to treat me, just kill me now and end my miserable life!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">The Lord said to Moses:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">While I am talking with you there, I will give them some of your authority, so they can share responsibility for my people. You will no longer have to care for them by yourself.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">As for the Israelites, I have heard them complaining about not having meat and about being better off in Egypt. So tell them to make themselves acceptable to me, because tomorrow they will have meat.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Moses replied, &amp;apos;At least 600,000 grown men are here with me. How can you say there will be enough meat to feed them and their families for a whole month?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Even if we butchered all our sheep and cattle, or caught every fish in the sea, we wouldn't have enough to feed them.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">The Lord answered, &amp;apos;I can do anything! Watch and you'll see my words come true.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">Moses told the people what the Lord had said. Then he chose 70 respected leaders and went with them to the sacred tent. While the leaders stood in a circle around the tent, Moses went inside,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">and the Lord spoke with him. Then the Lord took some authority from Moses and gave it to the 70 leaders. And when the Lord 's Spirit took control of them, they started shouting like prophets. But they did it only this one time.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">Eldad and Medad were two leaders who had not gone to the tent. But when the Spirit took control of them, they began shouting like prophets right there in camp.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">A boy ran to Moses and told him about Eldad and Medad.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">Joshua was there helping Moses, as he had done since he was young. And he said to Moses, &amp;apos;Sir, you must stop them!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">But Moses replied, &amp;apos;Are you concerned what this might do to me? I wish the Lord would give his Spirit to all his people so everyone could be a prophet.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">Then Moses and the 70 leaders went back to camp.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">Some time later the Lord sent a strong wind that blew quails in from the sea until Israel's camp was completely surrounded with birds, piled up about a meter high for many kilometers in every direction.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">The people picked up quails for two days&amp;ndash;each person filled at least ten large baskets. Then they spread them out to dry.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">But before the meat could be eaten, the Lord became angry and sent a deadly disease through the camp.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">After they had buried the people who had been so greedy for meat, they called the place &amp;apos;Graves for the Greedy.&amp;apos;</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="13">
			<VERS vnumber="1">The Lord said to Moses,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">&amp;apos;Choose a leader from each tribe and send them into Canaan to explore the land I am giving you.&amp;apos; Shammua son of Zaccur from Reuben, Shaphat son of Hori from Simeon, Caleb son of Jephunneh from Judah, Igal son of Joseph from Issachar, Joshua son of Nun Palti son of Raphu from Benjamin, Gaddiel son of Sodi from Zebulun, Gaddi son of Susi from Manasseh, Ammiel son of Gemalli from Dan, Sethur son of Michael from Asher, Nahbi son of Vophsi from Naphtali, and Geuel son of Machi from Gad. After you go through the Southern Desert of Canaan, continue north into the hill country Look at this fruit! The land we explored is rich with milk and honey.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">So Moses sent twelve tribal leaders from Israel's camp in the Paran Desert</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Before Moses sent them into Canaan, he said:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">and find out what those regions are like. Be sure to remember how many people live there, how strong they are,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">The twelve men left to explore Canaan from the Zin Desert in the south all the way to the town of Rehob near Lebo-Hamath in the north.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">As they went through the Southern Desert, they came to the town of Hebron, which was seven years older than the Egyptian town of Zoan. In Hebron, they saw the three Anakim clans of Ahiman, Sheshai, and Talmai.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">After exploring the land of Canaan for 40 days,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">the twelve men returned to Kadesh in the Paran Desert and told Moses, Aaron, and the people what they had seen. They showed them the fruit</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">and said:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">But the people who live there are strong, and their cities are large and walled. We even saw the three Anakim clans.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">Besides that, the Amalekites live in the Southern Desert; the Hittites, Jebusites, and Amorites are in the hill country; and the Canaanites live along the Mediterranean Sea and the Jordan River.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">Caleb calmed down the crowd and said, &amp;apos;Let's go and take the land. I know we can do it!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">But the other men replied, &amp;apos;Those people are much too strong for us.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">Then they started spreading rumors and saying, &amp;apos;We won't be able to grow anything in that soil. And the people are like giants.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">In fact, we saw the Nephilim who are the ancestors of the Anakim. They were so big that we felt as small as grasshoppers.&amp;apos;</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="14">
			<VERS vnumber="1">After the Israelites heard the report from the twelve men who had explored Canaan, the people cried all night</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="3">Is the Lord leading us into Canaan, just to have us killed and our women and children captured? We'd be better off in Egypt.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Then they said to one another, &amp;apos;Let's choose our own leader and go back.&amp;apos; We saw the land ourselves, and it's very good. With your mighty power you rescued your people from Egypt, so please don't destroy us here in the desert. If you do, the Egyptians will hear about it and tell the people of Canaan. Those Canaanites already know that we are your people, and that we see you face to face. And they have heard how you lead us with a thick cloud during the day and flaming fire at night. But if you kill us, they will claim it was because you weren't powerful enough to lead us into Canaan as you promised. In answer to your prayer, I do forgive them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Moses and Aaron bowed down to pray in front of the crowd.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Joshua and Caleb tore their clothes in sorrow</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="10">The crowd threatened to stone Moses and Aaron to death. But just then, the Lord appeared in a cloud at the sacred tent.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">The Lord said to Moses, &amp;apos;I have done great things for these people, and they still reject me by refusing to believe in my power.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">So they will no longer be my people. I will destroy them, but I will make you the ancestor of a nation even stronger than theirs.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Show us your great power, Lord . You promised</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">that you love to show mercy and kindness. And you said that you are very patient, but that you will punish everyone guilty of doing wrong&amp;ndash;not only them but their children and grandchildren as well.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">You are merciful, and you treat people better than they deserve. So please forgive these people, just as you have forgiven them ever since they left Egypt.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Then the Lord said to Moses:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">But as surely as I live and my power has no limit,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">But my servant Caleb isn't like the others. So because he has faith in me, I will allow him to cross into Canaan, and his descendants will settle there.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">Now listen, Moses! The Amalekites and the Canaanites live in the valleys of Canaan. And tomorrow, you'll need to turn around and head back into the desert toward the Red Sea.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">The Lord told Moses and Aaron</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">You will die right here in the desert, and your dead bodies will cover the ground. You have insulted me, and none of you men who are over 20 years old</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">will enter the land that I solemnly promised to give you as your own&amp;ndash;only Caleb and Joshua will go in.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">You were worried that your own children would be captured. But I, the Lord , will let them enter the land you have rejected.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="33">Your children will wander around in this desert 40 years, suffering because of your sins, until all of you are dead.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">I will punish you severely every day for the next 40 years&amp;ndash;one year for each day that the land was explored.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">You sinful people who ganged up against me will die here in the desert.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">Ten of the men sent to explore the land had brought back bad news and had made the people complain against the Lord .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">So he sent a deadly disease that killed those men,</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="39">The people of Israel were very sad after Moses gave them the Lord 's message.</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="15">
			<VERS vnumber="1">The Lord told Moses</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="3">Bulls or rams or goats are the animals that you may burn on the altar as sacrifices to please me. You may also offer sacrifices voluntarily or because you made a promise, or because they are part of your regular religious ceremonies. The smell of the smoke from these sacrifices is pleasing to me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">If a bull is offered as a sacrifice to please me or to ask my blessing,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">you must offer three kilograms of flour mixed with two liters of olive oil.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Two liters of wine must also be poured on the altar. The smell of this smoke is pleasing to me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">And the foreigners who live among you must also follow these rules.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">From the first batch of bread dough that you make after each new grain harvest, make a loaf of bread and offer it to me, just as you offer grain.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">All your descendants must follow this law and offer part of the first batch of bread dough.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">If all of you disobey one of my laws without knowing it, you must offer a bull as a sacrifice to please me, together with a grain sacrifice, a wine offering, and a goat as a sacrifice for sin.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">Then the priest will pray and ask me to forgive you. And since you did not mean to do wrong, and you offered sacrifices,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">the sin of everyone&amp;ndash;both Israelites and foreigners among you&amp;ndash;will be forgiven.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">But if one of you does wrong without knowing it, you must sacrifice a year-old female goat as a sacrifice for sin.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">The priest will then ask me to forgive you, and your sin will be forgiven.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">The law will be the same for anyone who does wrong without meaning to, whether an Israelite or a foreigner living among you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">Once, while the Israelites were traveling through the desert, a man was caught gathering firewood on the Sabbath.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">He was taken to Moses, Aaron, and the rest of the community.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">But no one knew what to do with him, so he was not allowed to leave.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="36">So he was killed, just as the Lord had commanded Moses.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">The Lord told Moses</VERS>

When that happened, the Lord appeared in all his glory They immediately bowed down and prayed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">When Moses heard this, he knelt down to pray.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="27">So everyone moved away from those tents, except Korah, Dathan, Abiram, and their families.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">Moses said to the crowd, &amp;apos;The Lord has chosen me and told me to do these things&amp;ndash;it wasn't my idea. And here's how you will know:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">If these men die a natural death, it means the Lord hasn't chosen me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">But suppose the Lord does something that has never been done before. For example, what if a huge crack appears in the ground, and these men and their families fall into it and are buried alive, together with everything they own? Then you will know they have turned their backs on the Lord !&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">As soon as Moses said this, the ground under the men opened up</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">The rest of the Israelites heard their screams, so they ran off, shouting, &amp;apos;We don't want that to happen to us!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">Suddenly the Lord sent a fire that burned up the 250 men who had offered incense to him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">Then the Lord said to Moses,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">&amp;apos;Tell Aaron's son Eleazar to take the fire pans from the smoldering fire and scatter the coals. The pans are now sacred,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">because they were used for offering incense to me. Have them hammered into a thin layer of bronze as a covering for the altar. Those men died because of their sin, and now their fire pans will become a warning for the rest of the community.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">Eleazar collected the pans and had them hammered into a thin layer of bronze as a covering for the altar,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">just as the Lord had told Moses. The pans were a warning to the Israelites that only Aaron's descendants would be allowed to offer incense to the Lord . Anyone else who tried to would be punished like Korah and his followers.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">The next day the people of Israel again complained against Moses and Aaron, &amp;apos;The two of you killed some of the Lord 's people!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">As the people crowded around them, Moses and Aaron turned toward the sacred tent, and the Lord appeared in his glory in the cloud covering the tent.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43">So Moses and Aaron walked to the front of the tent,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44">where the Lord said to them,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45">&amp;apos;Stand back! I am going to wipe out these Israelites once and for all.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46">Then Moses told Aaron, &amp;apos;Grab your fire pan and fill it with hot coals from the altar. Put incense in it, then quickly take it to where the people are and offer it to the Lord , so they can be forgiven. The Lord is very angry, and people have already started dying!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="49">But 14,700 Israelites were dead, not counting those who had died with Korah and his followers.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="5">I will then choose a man to be my priest, and his stick will sprout. After that happens, I won't have to listen to any more complaints about you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Moses told the people what the Lord had commanded, and they gave him the walking sticks from the twelve tribal leaders, including Aaron's from the Levi tribe.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Moses took them and placed them in the Lord 's sacred tent.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">The next day when Moses went into the tent, flowers and almonds were already growing on Aaron's stick.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="4">No one else is allowed to take care of the sacred tent or do anything connected with it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Follow these instructions, so I won't become angry and punish the Israelites ever again. I have put you in charge of the sacred gifts and sacrifices that the Israelites bring to me. And from now on, you, your sons, and your descendants will receive part of the sacrifices for sin, as well as part of the grain sacrifices, and the sacrifices to make things right. Your share of these sacrifices will be the parts not burned on the altar. Since the Levites won't be given any land in Israel as their own, When you receive from the people of Israel ten percent of their crops and newborn animals, you must offer a tenth of that to me. The gifts and sacrifices brought by the people must remain sacred, and if you eat any part of them before they are offered to me, you will be put to death.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="13">And the first part of the crops from their fields and vineyards also belongs to you. The people will offer this to me, then anyone in your family who is clean may have some of it.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1">The people of Israel arrived at the Zin Desert during the first month and set up camp near the town of Kadesh. It was there that Miriam died and was buried. We are Israelites, your own relatives, and we're sure you have heard the terrible things that have happened to us. Now we are camped at the border of your territory, near the town of Kadesh. Then Edom sent out its strongest troops When Moses and Eleazar came down,</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1">The Canaanite king of Arad lived in the Southern Desert of Canaan, and when he heard that the Israelites were on their way to the village of Atharim, he attacked and took some of them hostage. Moses prayed, Let's celebrate! The well has given us water. our leaders pointed out where to dig the well. The Israelites left the desert and camped near the town of Mattanah, Come and rebuild Heshbon, King Sihon's capital city! like fiery flames, burning down the town of Ar along the Arnon River. Your god Chemosh deserted your people; they were captured, taken away by King Sihon the Amorite. The towns of Heshbon and Dibon, of Nophah and Medeba</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">The Israelites prayed, &amp;apos;Our Lord , if you will help us defeat these Canaanites, we will completely destroy their towns and everything in them, to show that they belong to you.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">The Lord answered their prayer and helped them wipe out the Canaanite army and completely destroy their towns. That's why one of the towns is named Hormah, which means &amp;apos;Destroyed Place.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">The Israelites had to go around the territory of Edom, so when they left Mount Hor, they headed south toward the Red Sea. But along the way, the people became so impatient</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">that they complained against God and said to Moses, &amp;apos;Did you bring us out of Egypt, just to let us die in the desert? There's no water out here, and we can't stand this awful food!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Then the Lord sent poisonous snakes that bit and killed many of them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Some of the people went to Moses and admitted, &amp;apos;It was wrong of us to insult you and the Lord . Now please ask him to make these snakes go away.&amp;apos;</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="4">They said to the Midianite leaders, &amp;apos;That huge mob of Israelites will wipe out everything in sight, like a bull eating grass in a field.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">sent a message to Balaam son of Beor who lived among his relatives in the town of Pethor near the Euphrates River. It said:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">They are too powerful for us to defeat, so would you come and place a curse on them? Maybe then we can run them off. I know that anyone you bless will be successful, but anyone you curse will fail.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">The leaders of Moab and Midian left and took along money to pay Balaam. When they got to his house, they gave him Balak's message.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">&amp;apos;Spend the night here,&amp;apos; Balaam replied, &amp;apos;and tomorrow I will tell you the Lord 's answer.&amp;apos; So the officials stayed at his house.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">During the night, God asked Balaam, &amp;apos;Who are these people at your house?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">&amp;apos;They are messengers from King Balak of Moab,&amp;apos; Balaam answered. &amp;apos;He sent them</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="12">But God replied, &amp;apos;Don't go with Balak's messengers. I have blessed those people who have come from Egypt, so don't curse them.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">The next morning, Balaam said to Balak's officials, &amp;apos;Go on back home. The Lord says I cannot go with you.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">The officials left and told Balak that Balaam refused to come.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Then Balak sent a larger group of officials, who were even more important than the first ones.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">They went to Balaam and told him that Balak had said, &amp;apos;Balaam, if you come to Moab,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">I'll pay you very well and do whatever you ask. Just come and place a curse on these people.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Balaam answered, &amp;apos;Even if Balak offered me a palace full of silver or gold, I wouldn't do anything to disobey the Lord my God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">You are welcome to spend the night here, just as the others did. I will find out if the Lord has something else to say about this.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">That night, God said, &amp;apos;Balaam, I'll let you go to Moab with Balak's messengers, but do only what I say.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">So Balaam got up the next morning and saddled his donkey, then left with the Moabite officials.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Balaam was riding his donkey to Moab, and two of his servants were with him. But God was angry that Balaam had gone, so one of the Lord 's angels stood in the road to stop him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">When Balaam's donkey saw the angel standing there with a sword, it walked off the road and into an open field. Balaam had to beat the donkey to get it back on the road.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">Then the angel stood between two vineyards, in a narrow path with a stone wall on each side.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">When the donkey saw the angel, it walked so close to one of the walls that Balaam's foot scraped against the wall. Balaam beat the donkey again.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">The angel moved once more and stood in a spot so narrow that there was no room for the donkey to go around.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">So it just lay down. Balaam lost his temper, then picked up a stick and whacked the donkey.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">When that happened, the Lord told the donkey to speak, and it asked Balaam, &amp;apos;What have I done that made you beat me three times?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">&amp;apos;You made me look stupid!&amp;apos; Balaam answered. &amp;apos;If I had a sword, I'd kill you here and now!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">&amp;apos;But you're my owner,&amp;apos; answered the donkey, &amp;apos;and you've ridden me many times. Have I ever done anything like this before?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">Just then, the Lord let Balaam see the angel standing in the road, holding a sword, and Balaam bowed down.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">The angel said, &amp;apos;You had no right to treat your donkey like that! I was the one who blocked your way, because I don't think you should go to Moab.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">If your donkey had not seen me and stopped those three times, I would have killed you and let the donkey live.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">Balaam replied, &amp;apos;I was wrong. I didn't know you were trying to stop me. If you don't think I should go, I'll return home at once.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">&amp;apos;It's all right for you to go,&amp;apos; the Lord 's angel answered. &amp;apos;But you must say only what I tell you.&amp;apos; So Balaam went on with Balak's officials.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">When Balak heard that Balaam was coming, he went to meet him at the town of Ir on the Arnon River, which is the northern border of Moab.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">Balak asked, &amp;apos;Why didn't you come when I invited you the first time? Did you think I wasn't going to pay you?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">&amp;apos;I'm here now,&amp;apos; Balaam answered. &amp;apos;But I will say only what God tells me to say.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">They left and went to the town of Kiriath-Huzoth,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">where Balak sacrificed cattle and sheep and gave some of the meat to Balaam and the officials who were with him.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="8">This is exactly what happened when I sent your ancestors from Kadesh-Barnea to explore the land.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">They went as far as Eshcol Valley, then returned and told the people that we should not enter it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">The Lord became very angry.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">And he said that no one who was 20 years or older when they left Egypt would enter the land he had promised to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Not one of those people believed in the Lord 's power,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">except Caleb and Joshua. They remained faithful to the Lord ,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">but he was so angry with the others that he forced them to wander around in the desert for 40 years. By that time everyone who had sinned against him had died.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Now you people of Reuben and Gad are doing the same thing and making the Lord even angrier.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">If you reject the Lord , he will once again abandon his people and leave them here in the desert. And you will be to blame!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">The men from Reuben and Gad replied:</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="18">We will stay with them until they have settled in their own tribal lands.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">The land on this side of the Jordan River will be ours, so we won't expect to receive any on the other side.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Moses said:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">You also agreed to cross the Jordan and stay with the rest of the Israelites, until the Lord forces our enemies out of the land. If you do these things,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">then after the Lord helps Israel capture the land, you can return to your own land. You will no longer have to stay with the others.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">But if you don't keep your promise, you will sin against the Lord and be punished.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">Go ahead and build towns for your wives and children, and places for your sheep and goats. Just be sure to do what you have promised.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">The men from Reuben and Gad answered:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">Our wives and children and sheep and cattle will stay here in the towns in Gilead.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">But those of us who are prepared for battle will cross the Jordan and fight for the Lord .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">Then Moses said to Eleazar, Joshua, and the family leaders,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">&amp;apos;Make sure that the tribes of Gad and Reuben prepare for battle and cross the Jordan River with you. If they do, then after the land is in your control, give them the region of Gilead as their tribal land.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">But if they break their promise, they will receive land on the other side of the Jordan, like the rest of the tribes.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">The tribes of Gad and Reuben replied, &amp;apos;We are your servants and will do whatever the Lord has commanded.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">We will cross the Jordan River, ready to fight for the Lord in Canaan. But the land we will inherit as our own will be on this side of the river.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">So Moses gave the tribes of Gad, Reuben, and half of Manasseh the territory and towns that King Sihon the Amorite had ruled, as well as the territory and towns that King Og of Bashan had ruled.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="39">The clan of Machir from the tribe of East Manasseh went to the region of Gilead, captured its towns, and forced out the Amorites.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1">While the people of Israel were still camped in the lowlands of Moab across the Jordan River from Jericho, the Lord told Moses</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="6">Six of the towns you give them will be Safe Towns where a person who has accidentally killed someone can run for protection. But you will also give the Levites 42 other towns,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">so they will have a total of 48 towns with their surrounding pastures.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Since the towns for the Levites must come from Israel's own tribal lands, the larger tribes will give more towns than the smaller ones.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">The Lord then told Moses</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="11">choose Safe Towns, where a person who has accidentally killed someone can run for protection.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">If the victim's relatives think it was murder, they might try to take revenge. Anyone accused of murder can run to one of these Safe Towns for protection and not be killed before a trial is held.</VERS>

	<BIBLEBOOK bnumber="5" bname="Deuteronomy">
		<CHAPTER cnumber="1">
			<VERS vnumber="6">People of Israel, when we were in our camp at Mount Sinai, the Lord our God told us:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Leave this place and go into the land that belongs to the Amorites and their neighbors the Canaanites. This land includes the Jordan River valley, the hill country, the western foothills, the Southern Desert, the Mediterranean seacoast, the Lebanon Mountains, and all the territory as far as the Euphrates River.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">I give you this land, just as I promised your ancestors Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Now you must go and take the land.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Right after the Lord commanded us to leave Mount Sinai, I told you:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">The Lord our God has blessed us, and so now there are as many of us as there are stars in the sky.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">God has even promised to bless us a thousand times more, and I pray that he will.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">But I cannot take care of all your problems and settle all your arguments alone.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Each tribe must choose some experienced men who are known for their wisdom and understanding, and I will make those men the official leaders of their tribes.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">You answered, &amp;apos;That's a good idea!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Then I took these men, who were already wise and respected leaders, and I appointed them as your official leaders. Some of them became military officers in charge of groups of 1,000, or 100, or 50, or 10,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">and others became judges. I gave these judges the following instructions:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">And it doesn't matter if one is helpless and the other is powerful. Don't be afraid of anyone! No matter who shows up in your court, God will help you make a fair decision.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">After I gave these instructions to the judges, I taught you the Lord 's commands.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">The Lord had commanded us to leave Mount Sinai and go to the hill country that belonged to the Amorites, so we started out into the huge desert. You remember how frightening it was, but soon we were at Kadesh-Barnea,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Then all of you came to me and said, &amp;apos;Before we go into the land, let's send some men to explore it. When they come back, they can tell us about the towns we will find and what roads we should take to get there.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">It seemed like a good idea, so I chose twelve men, one from each tribe.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">They explored the hill country as far as Bunch Valley</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">and even brought back some of the fruit. They said, &amp;apos;The Lord our God is giving us good land.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">You did not want to go into the land, and you refused to obey the Lord your God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">You stayed in your tents and grumbled, &amp;apos;The Lord must hate us&amp;ndash;he brought us out of Egypt, just so he could hand us over to the Amorites and get rid of us.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">We are afraid, because the men who explored the land told us that the cities are large, with walls that reach to the sky. The people who live there are taller and stronger than we are, and some of them are Anakim. We have nowhere to go.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">Then I said, &amp;apos;Don't worry!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">The Lord our God will lead the way. He will fight on our side, just as he did when we saw him do all those things to the Egyptians.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">And you know that the Lord has taken care of us the whole time we've been in the desert, just as you might carry one of your children.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">But you still would not trust the Lord ,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">even though he had always been with us in the desert. During the daytime, the Lord was in the cloud, leading us in the right direction and showing us where to camp. And at night, he was there in the fire.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">You had made the Lord angry, and he said:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">You people of this generation are evil, and I refuse to let you go into the good land that I promised your ancestors.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">Caleb son of Jephunneh is the only one of your generation that I will allow to go in. He obeyed me completely, so I will give him and his descendants the land he explored.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">The Lord was even angry with me because of you people, and he said, &amp;apos;Moses, I won't let you go into the land either.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">Instead, I will let Joshua your assistant lead Israel to conquer the land. So encourage him.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">Then the Lord spoke to you again:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">Now, turn around and go back into the desert by way of Red Sea Road.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">Then you told me, &amp;apos;We disobeyed the Lord our God, but now we want to obey him. We will go into the hill country and fight, just as he told us to do.&amp;apos; So you picked up your weapons, thinking it would be easy to take over the hill country.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">But the Lord said, &amp;apos;Moses, warn them not to go into the hill country. I won't help them fight, and their enemies will defeat them.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43">I told you what the Lord had said, but you paid no attention. You disobeyed him and went into the hill country anyway. You thought you were so great!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44">But when the Amorites in the hill country attacked from their towns, you ran from them as you would run from a swarm of bees. The Amorites chased your troops into Seir as far as Hormah, killing them as they went.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45">Then you came back to the place of worship at Kadesh-Barnea and wept, but the Lord would not listen to your prayers.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46">After we had been in Kadesh for a few months, we obeyed the Lord and headed back into the desert by way of Red Sea Road.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="2">
			<VERS vnumber="1">We spent many years wandering around outside the hill country of Seir,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">until the Lord said: Moses,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Israel has wandered in these hills long enough. Turn and go north.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">And give the people these orders: &amp;apos;Be very careful, because you will soon go through the land that belongs to your relatives, the descendants of Esau. They are afraid of you,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">but don't start a war with them. I have given them the hill country of Seir, so I won't give any of it to you, not even enough to set a foot on.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">And as you go through their land, you will have to buy food and water from them.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">The Lord has helped us and taken care of us during the past 40 years that we have been in this huge desert. We've had everything we needed, and the Lord has blessed us and made us successful in whatever we have done.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">We went past the territory that belonged to our relatives, the descendants of Esau. We followed Arabah Road that starts in the south at Elath and Ezion-Geber, then we turned onto the desert road that leads to Moab.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">The Lord told me, &amp;apos;Don't try to start a war with Moab. Leave them alone, because I gave the land of Ar to them, and I will not let you have any of it.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Before the Lord gave the Moabites their land, a large and powerful tribe lived there. They were the Emim, and they were as tall as the Anakim.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">The Moabites called them Emim, though others sometimes used the name Rephaim for both the Anakim and the Emim.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">The Horites used to live in Seir, but the Edomites took over that region. They killed many of the Horites and forced the rest of them to leave, just as Israel did to the people in the land that the Lord gave them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">When we came to the Zered Gorge along the southern border of Moab, the Lord told us to cross the gorge into Moab, and we did.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">This was 38 years after we left Kadesh-Barnea, and by that time all the men who had been in the army at Kadesh-Barnea had died, just as the Lord had said they would.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Then the Lord told me,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">&amp;apos;Moses, now go past the town of Ar and cross Moab's northern border</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">into Ammon. But don't start a war with the Ammonites. I gave them their land, and I won't give any of it to Israel.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Before the Ammonites conquered the land that the Lord had given them, some of the Rephaim used to live there, although the Ammonites called them Zamzummim.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">The Zamzummim were a large and powerful tribe and were as tall as the Anakim. But the Lord helped the Ammonites, and they killed many of the Zamzummim and forced the rest to leave. Then the Ammonites settled there.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">The Lord helped them as he had helped the Edomites, who killed many of the Horites in Seir and forced the rest to leave before settling there themselves.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">A group called the Avvim used to live in villages as far south as Gaza, but the Philistines killed them and settled on their land.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">After we went through Ammon, the Lord told us: Israel, pack up your possessions, take down your tents, and cross the Arnon River gorge. The territory of the Amorite King Sihon of Heshbon lies on the other side of the river, but I now give you his land. So attack and take it!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">Today I will start making all other nations afraid of you. They will tremble with fear when anyone mentions you, and they will be terrified when you show up.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">After we had crossed the Arnon and had set up camp in the Kedemoth Desert, I sent messengers to King Sihon of Heshbon, telling him that his nation and ours could be at peace. I said:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">Please let Israel go across your country. We will walk straight through, without turning off the road.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">We met Sihon and his army in battle at Jahaz,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">and the Lord our God helped us defeat them. We killed Sihon, his sons, and everyone else in his army.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">Then we captured and destroyed every town in Sihon's kingdom, killing everyone,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">but keeping the livestock and everything else of value.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">The Lord helped us capture every town from the Arnon River gorge north to the boundary of Gilead, including the town of Aroer on the edge of the gorge and the town in the middle of the gorge.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">However, we stayed away from all the Ammonite towns, both in the hill country and near the Jabbok River, just as the Lord had commanded.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="8">Sihon and Og had ruled Amorite kingdoms east of the Jordan River. Their land stretched from the Arnon River gorge in the south to Mount Hermon in the north, and we captured it all.</VERS>

You used your great power to rescue them from Egypt and to make them your very own.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="15">Fire was raging on the mountaintop as I went back down, carrying the two stones with the commandments on them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">I saw how quickly you had sinned and disobeyed the Lord your God. There you were, worshiping the metal idol you had made in the shape of a calf.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="8">After I put the two stones in the sacred chest, the Lord chose the tribe of Levi, not only to carry the chest, but also to serve as his priests at the place of worship and to bless the other tribes in his name. And they still do these things.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1">Now I'll tell you the laws and teachings that you have to obey as long as you live. Your ancestors worshiped the Lord , and he is giving you this land.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">But the nations that live there worship other gods. So after you capture the land, you must completely destroy their places of worship&amp;ndash;on mountains and hills or in the shade of large trees.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Wherever these nations worship their gods, you must tear down their altars, break their sacred stones, burn the sacred poles used in worshiping the goddess Asherah, and smash their idols to pieces. Destroy these places of worship so completely that no one will remember they were ever there.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Don't worship the Lord your God in the way those nations worship their gods. Sometimes you may want to kill an animal for food and not as a sacrifice. If the Lord has blessed you and given you enough cows or sheep or goats, then you can butcher one of them where you live. You can eat it just like the meat from a deer or gazelle that you kill when you go hunting. And even those people who are unclean and unfit for worship can have some of the meat. But you must not eat the blood of any animal&amp;ndash;let the blood drain out on the ground.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">It is the same as eating the meat from a deer or a gazelle that you kill when you go hunting. And in this way, anyone who is unclean and unfit for worship can have some of the meat.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">Do you want the Lord to make you successful? Do you want your children to be successful even after you are gone? Then do what pleases the Lord and don't eat blood.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">If you obey these laws, you will be doing what the Lord your God says is right and good. Then he will help you and your descendants be successful.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">Israel, as you go into the land and attack the nations that are there, the Lord will get rid of them, and you can have their land.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">But that's when you must be especially careful not to ask, &amp;apos;How did those nations worship their gods? Shouldn't we worship the Lord in the same way?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">No, you should not! The Lord hates the disgusting way those nations worship their gods, because they even burn their sons and daughters as sacrifices.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">Obey all the laws and teachings I am giving you. Don't add any, and don't take any away.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="3">If the prophet says this, don't listen! The Lord your God will be watching to find out whether or not you love him with all your heart and soul.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">You must be completely faithful to the Lord . Worship and obey only the Lord and do this with fear and trembling,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">because he rescued you from slavery in Egypt. If a prophet tells you to disobey the Lord your God and to stop worshiping him, then that prophet is evil and must be put to death. The gods worshiped by other nations have never done anything for you or your ancestors. People who ask you to worship other gods are trying to get you to stop worshiping the Lord , who rescued you from slavery in Egypt. So put to death anyone who asks you to worship another god.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">And when the rest of Israel hears about it, they will be afraid, and no one else will ever do such an evil thing again.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">After the Lord your God gives you towns to live in, you may hear a rumor about one of the towns.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">You may hear that some worthless people have talked everyone there into worshiping other gods, even though these gods had never done anything for them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">You must carefully find out if the rumor is true. Then if the people of that town have actually done such a disgusting thing in your own country,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">you must take your swords and kill every one of them, and their livestock too.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">That's why you must do what the Lord your God says is right. I am giving you his laws and teachings today, and you must obey them.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1">People of Israel, you are the Lord 's children, so when you mourn for the dead, you must not cut yourselves or shave your forehead.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Out of all the nations on this earth, the Lord your God chose you to be his own. You belong to the Lord , so don't behave like those who worship other gods. Don't boil a young goat in its mother's milk.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Don't eat any disgusting animals.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">It is all right to eat meat from any animals that have divided hoofs and also chew the cud.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">But don't eat camels, rabbits, and rock badgers. These animals chew the cud but do not have divided hoofs. You must treat them as unclean.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">And don't eat pork, since pigs have divided hoofs, but they do not chew their cud. Don't even touch a dead pig!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">You can eat any fish that has fins and scales. But there are other creatures that live in the water,</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="22">People of Israel, every year you must set aside ten percent of your grain harvest.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">Also set aside ten percent of your wine and olive oil, and the first-born of every cow, sheep, and goat. Take these to the place where the Lord chooses to be worshiped, and eat them there. This will teach you to always respect the Lord your God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">But suppose you can't carry that ten percent of your harvest to the place where the Lord chooses to be worshiped. If you live too far away, or if the Lord gives you a big harvest,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">then sell this part and take the money there instead.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">When you and your family arrive, spend the money on food for a big celebration. Buy cattle, sheep, goats, wine, beer, and if there are any other kinds of food that you want, buy those too.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">And since people of the Levi tribe won't own any land for growing crops, remember to ask the Levites to celebrate with you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">Every third year, instead of using the ten percent of your harvest for a big celebration, bring it into town and put it in a community storehouse.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">The Levites have no land of their own, so you must give them food from the storehouse. You must also give food to the poor who live in your town, including orphans, widows, and foreigners. If they have enough to eat, then the Lord your God will be pleased and make you successful in everything you do.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="3">This law applies only to loans you have made to other Israelites. Foreigners will still have to pay back what you have loaned them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">After the Lord your God gives land to each of you, there may be poor Israelites in the town where you live. If there are, then don't be mean and selfish with your money.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Instead, be kind and lend them what they need.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Be careful! Don't say to yourself, &amp;apos;Soon it will be the seventh year, and then I won't be able to get my money back.&amp;apos; It would be horrible for you to think that way and to be so selfish that you refuse to help the poor. They are your relatives, and if you don't help them, they may ask the Lord to decide whether you have done wrong. And he will say that you are guilty.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">You should be happy to give the poor what they need, because then the Lord will make you successful in everything you do.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">There will always be some Israelites who are poor and needy. That's why I am commanding you to be generous with them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">If any of you buy Israelites as slaves, you must set them free after six years.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">And don't just tell them they are free to leave&amp;ndash;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">give them sheep and goats and a good supply of grain and wine. The more the Lord has given you, the more you should give them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">I am commanding you to obey the Lord as a reminder that you were slaves in Egypt before he set you free.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">But one of your slaves may say, &amp;apos;I love you and your family, and I would be better off staying with you, so please don't make me leave.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Take the slave to the door of your house and push a sharp metal rod through one earlobe and into the door. Such slaves will belong to you for life, whether they are men or women.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Don't complain when you have to set a slave free. After all, you got six years of service at half the cost of hiring someone to do the work.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">If the first-born animal of a cow or sheep or goat is a male, it must be given to the Lord . Don't put first-born cattle to work or cut wool from first-born sheep.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Instead, each year you must take the first-born of these animals to the place where the Lord your God chooses to be worshiped. You and your family will sacrifice them to the Lord and then eat them as part of a sacred meal.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">But if the animal is lame or blind or has something else wrong with it, you must not sacrifice it to the Lord your God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">You can butcher it where you live, and eat it just like the meat of a deer or gazelle that you kill while hunting. Even those people who are unclean and unfit for worship can have some.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1">People of Israel, you must celebrate Passover in the month of Abib, because one night in that month years ago, the Lord your God rescued you from Egypt.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="5">Don't offer the Passover sacrifice in just any town where you happen to live.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">It must be offered at the place where the Lord chooses to be worshiped. Kill the sacrifice at sunset, the time of day when you left Egypt.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="8">Eat thin bread for the next six days. Then on the seventh day, don't do any work. Instead, come together and worship the Lord .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Seven weeks after you start your grain harvest,</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="16">Each year there are three festivals when all Israelite men must go to the place where the Lord chooses to be worshiped. These are the Festival of Thin Bread, the Harvest Festival, and the Festival of Shelters. And don't forget to take along a gift for the Lord .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">The bigger the harvest the Lord gives you, the bigger your gift should be.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">People of Israel, if you want to enjoy a long and successful life, make sure that everyone is treated with justice in the land the Lord is giving you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">When you build the altar for offering sacrifices to the Lord your God, don't set up a sacred pole for the worship of the goddess Asherah.</VERS>

If the king completely obeys the Lord 's commands, he and his descendants will rule Israel for many years.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">So when you hear that someone in your town is committing this disgusting sin, you must carefully find out if that person really is guilty.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">When other Israelites hear about it, they will be afraid and obey the decisions of the court.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">People of Israel, after you capture the land the Lord your God is giving you, and after you settle on it, you will say, &amp;apos;We want a king, just like the nations around us.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Go ahead and appoint a king, but make sure that he is an Israelite and that he is the one the Lord has chosen.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1">The people of the Levi tribe, including the priests, will not receive any land. Instead, they will receive part of the sacrifices that are offered to the Lord ,</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="3">When you sacrifice a bull or sheep, the priests will be given the shoulder, the jaws, and the stomach.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">In addition, they will receive the first part of your grain harvest and part of your first batches of wine and olive oil. You must also give them the first wool that is cut from your sheep each year.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Give these gifts to the priests, because the Lord has chosen them and their descendants out of all the tribes of Israel to be his special servants at the place of worship.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Any Levite can leave his hometown, and go to the place where the Lord chooses to be worshiped,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">and then be a special servant of the Lord there, just like all the other Levites.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="13">Never be guilty of doing any of these disgusting things!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">You will go in and take the land from nations that practice magic and witchcraft. But the Lord your God won't allow you to do those things.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="16">You were asking for a prophet the day you were gathered at Mount Sinai and said to the Lord , &amp;apos;Please don't let us hear your voice or see this terrible fire again&amp;ndash;if we do, we will die!&amp;apos;</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1">Soon you will go into the land and attack the nations. The Lord your God will destroy them and give you their lands, towns, and homes. Then after you are settled,</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="6">You don't deserve to die, since you did not mean to harm your friend. But he did get killed, and his relatives might be very angry. They might even choose one of the men from their family to track you down and kill you. If it is too far to one of the Safe Towns, the victim's relative might be able to catch you and kill you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">That's why I said there must be three Safe Towns.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">You will need them, so innocent people won't be killed on your land while they are trying to reach a Safe Town that is too far away. You will be guilty of murder, if innocent people lose their lives because you didn't name enough Safe Towns in the land the Lord your God will give you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">But what if you really do commit murder? Suppose one of you hates a neighbor. So you wait in a deserted place, kill the neighbor, and run to a Safe Town.</VERS>

Meanwhile, Rahab had taken the men up to the flat roof of her house and had hidden them under some piles of flax plants that she had put there to dry. She answered, &amp;apos;Some men did come to my house, but I didn't know where they had come from. They left about sunset, just before it was time to close the town gate. I don't know where they were going, but if you hurry, maybe you can catch them.&amp;apos; The soldiers came to her door and demanded, &amp;apos;Let us have the men who are staying at your house. They are spies.&amp;apos; The guards at the town gate let the soldiers leave Jericho, but they closed the gate again as soon as the soldiers went through. Then the soldiers headed toward the Jordan River to look for the spies at the place where people cross the river. You made us promise to let you and your family live. We will keep our promise, but you can't tell anyone why we were here. You must tie this red rope on your window when we attack, and your father and mother, your brothers, and everyone else in your family must be here with you.

			<VERS vnumber="15">Rahab's house was built into the town wall, and one of the windows in her house faced outside the wall. She gave the spies a rope, showed them the window, and said, &amp;apos;Use this rope to let yourselves down to the ground outside the wall.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1">After Israel had crossed the Jordan, the Lord said to Joshua: Go to the middle of the riverbed where the sacred chest is, and pick up a large rock. Carry it on your shoulder to our camp. There are twelve of you, so there will be one rock for each tribe. The priests stayed right where they were until the people had followed the orders that the Lord had given Moses and Joshua.

And why had they wandered for 40 years? It was because right after they left Egypt, the men in the army had disobeyed the Lord . And the Lord had said, &amp;apos;None of you men will ever live to see the land that I promised Israel. It is a land rich with milk and honey, and someday your children will live there, but not before you die here in the desert.&amp;apos; Joshua fell to his knees and bowed down to the ground. &amp;apos;I am your servant,&amp;apos; he said. &amp;apos;Tell me what to do.&amp;apos; So Joshua took off his sandals.</VERS>

But on the seventh day, march slowly around the town seven times while the priests blow their trumpets. As soon as Joshua finished giving the orders, the army started marching. One group of soldiers led the way, with seven priests marching behind them and blowing trumpets. Then came the priests carrying the chest, followed by the rest of the soldiers. Get ready to shout! The Lord will let you capture this town. Joshua said to the two men who had been spies, &amp;apos;Rahab kept you safe when I sent you to Jericho. We promised to protect her and her family, and we will keep that promise. Now go into her house and bring them out.&amp;apos;</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="16">Then the priests blew the trumpets, and Joshua yelled:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">But you must destroy it and everything in it, to show that it now belongs to the Lord . The woman Rahab helped the spies we sent, so protect her and the others who are inside her house. But kill everyone else in the town.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="27">The Lord helped Joshua in everything he did, and Joshua was famous everywhere in Canaan.</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="7">
			<VERS vnumber="1">The Lord had said that everything in Jericho belonged to him. But Achan from the Judah tribe took some of the things from Jericho for himself. And so the Lord was angry with the Israelites, because one of them had disobeyed him. The spies left and went to Ai, which is east of Bethel and near Beth-Aven. Our Lord , did you bring us across the Jordan River just so the Amorites could destroy us? This wouldn't have happened if we had agreed to stay on the other side of the Jordan. Stop lying there on the ground! Get up! Joshua told some people to run to Achan's tent, where they found the silver, the gold, and the robe. The people of Israel then stoned to death Achan and his family. They made a fire and burned the bodies, together with what Achan had stolen, and all his possessions. That's how the place came to be called Trouble Valley.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">While Israel was still camped near Jericho, Joshua sent some spies with these instructions: &amp;apos;Go to the town of Ai and find out whatever you can about the region around the town.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">They went back to Joshua and reported, &amp;apos;You don't need to send the whole army to attack Ai&amp;ndash;2,000 or 3,000 troops will be enough. Why bother the whole army for a town that small?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Joshua and the leaders of Israel tore their clothes and put dirt on their heads to show their sorrow. They lay facedown on the ground in front of the sacred chest until sunset.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Then Joshua said:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">I don't even know what to say to you, since Israel's army has turned and run from the enemy.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Everyone will think you weren't strong enough to protect your people. Now the Canaanites and everyone else who lives in the land will surround us and wipe us out.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">The Lord answered:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">I said everything in Jericho belonged to me and had to be destroyed. But the Israelites have kept some of the things for themselves. They stole from me and hid what they took. Then they lied about it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">What they stole was supposed to be destroyed, and now Israel itself must be destroyed. I cannot help you anymore until you do exactly what I have said. That's why Israel turns and runs from its enemies instead of standing up to them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Tell the people of Israel, &amp;apos;Tomorrow you will meet with the Lord your God, so make yourselves acceptable to worship him. The Lord says that you have taken things that should have been destroyed. You won't be able to stand up to your enemies until you get rid of those things.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">&amp;apos;Tomorrow morning everyone must gather near the place of worship. You will come forward tribe by tribe, and the Lord will show which tribe is guilty. Next, the clans in that tribe must come forward, and the Lord will show which clan is guilty. The families in that clan must come, and the Lord will point out the guilty family. Finally, the men in that family must come,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">and the Lord will show who stole what should have been destroyed. That man must be put to death, his body burned, and his possessions thrown into the fire. He has done a terrible thing by breaking the sacred agreement that the Lord made with Israel.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Joshua got up early the next morning and brought each tribe to the place of worship, where the Lord showed that the Judah tribe was guilty.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Then Joshua brought the clans of Judah to the Lord , and the Lord showed that the Zerah clan was guilty. One by one he brought the leader of each family in the Zerah clan to the Lord , and the Lord showed that Zabdi's family was guilty.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Finally, Joshua brought each man in Zabdi's family to the Lord , and the Lord showed that Achan was the guilty one.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">&amp;apos;Achan,&amp;apos; Joshua said, &amp;apos;the Lord God of Israel has decided that you are guilty. So tell me what you did, and don't try to hide anything.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">&amp;apos;It's true,&amp;apos; Achan answered. &amp;apos;I sinned and disobeyed the Lord God of Israel.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">They brought them back and put them in front of the sacred chest, so Joshua and the rest of the Israelites could see them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">Then everyone took Achan and the things he had stolen to Trouble Valley. They also took along his sons and daughters, his cattle, donkeys, and sheep, his tent, and everything else that belonged to him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">Joshua said, &amp;apos;Achan, you caused us a lot of trouble. Now the Lord is paying you back with the same kind of trouble.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">They covered the remains with a big pile of rocks, which is still there. Then the Lord stopped being angry with Israel.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="7">you come out of hiding. The Lord our God will help you capture the town.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Then set it on fire, as the Lord has told us to do. Those are your orders,</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="10">Early the next morning he got his troops ready to move out, and he and the other leaders of Israel led them to Ai.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="12">Joshua had already sent 5,000 soldiers to the west side of the town to hide and wait to attack.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Now all his troops were in place. Part of the army was in the camp to the north of Ai, and the others were hiding to the west, ready to make a surprise attack. That night, Joshua went into the valley.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Finally, the Lord told Joshua, &amp;apos;Point your sword at the town of Ai, because now I am going to help you defeat it!&amp;apos;</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="9">
			<VERS vnumber="3">The people of Gibeon had also heard what Joshua had done to Jericho and Ai.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">So they decided that some of their men should pretend to be messengers to Israel from a faraway country. The men put worn-out bags on their donkeys and found some old wineskins that had cracked and had been sewn back together.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Their sandals were old and patched, and their clothes were worn out. They even took along some dry and crumbly bread.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Then they went to the Israelite camp at Gilgal, where they said to Joshua and the men of Israel, &amp;apos;We have come from a country that is far from here. Please make a peace treaty with us.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">We are your servants, and we live far from here. We came because the Lord your God is so famous. We heard what the Lord did in Egypt</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">and what he did to those two Amorite kings on the other side of the Jordan: King Og of Bashan, who lived in Ashtaroth, and King Sihon of Heshbon.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Our leaders and everyone who lives in our country told us to meet with you and tell you that all of us are your servants. They said to ask you to make a peace treaty with our people. They told us to be sure and take along enough food for our journey.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">See this dry, crumbly bread of ours? It was hot out of the oven when we packed the food on the day we left our homes.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">These cracked wineskins were new when we filled them, and our clothes and sandals are worn out because we have traveled so far.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">The Israelites tried some of the food, but they did not ask the Lord if he wanted them to make a treaty.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">So Joshua made a peace treaty with the messengers and promised that Israel would not kill their people. Israel's leaders swore that Israel would keep this promise.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">But they did not attack the towns, because the Israelite leaders had sworn in the name of the Lord that they would let these people live.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Joshua told some of his soldiers, &amp;apos;I want to meet with the Gibeonite leaders. Bring them here.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">So now you are under a curse, and from now on your people will have to send workers to cut wood and carry water for the place of worship.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">The Gibeonites answered, &amp;apos;The Lord your God told his servant Moses that you were to kill everyone who lives here and take their land for yourselves. We were afraid you would kill us, and so we tricked you into making a peace treaty. But we agreed to be your servants,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">and you are strong enough to do anything to us that you want. We just ask you to do what seems right.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">Joshua did not let the Israelites kill the Gibeonites,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">but he did tell the Gibeonites that they would have to be servants of the nation of Israel. They would have to cut firewood and bring it for the priests to use for burning sacrifices on the Lord 's altar, wherever the Lord decided the altar would be. The Gibeonites would also have to carry water for the priests. And that is still the work of the Gibeonites.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="10">
			<VERS vnumber="1">King Adonizedek of Jerusalem heard that Joshua had captured and destroyed the town of Ai, and then killed its king as he had done at Jericho. He also learned that the Gibeonites had signed a peace treaty with Israel.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">This frightened Adonizedek and his people. They knew that Gibeon was a large town, as big as the towns that had kings, and even bigger than the town of Ai had been. And all of the men of Gibeon were warriors.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">So Adonizedek sent messages to the kings of four other towns: King Hoham of Hebron, King Piram of Jarmuth, King Japhia of Lachish, and King Debir of Eglon. The messages said,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">&amp;apos;The Gibeonites have signed a peace treaty with Joshua and the Israelites. Come and help me attack Gibeon!&amp;apos; &amp;apos;Our Lord , make the sun stop in the sky over Gibeon, and the moon stand still So the sun and the moon stopped and stood still until Israel defeated its enemies. Joshua's troops obeyed his orders, and those rocks are still there.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">When these five Amorite kings called their armies together and attacked Gibeon,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">the Gibeonites sent a message to the Israelite camp at Gilgal: &amp;apos;Joshua, please come and rescue us! The Amorite kings from the hill country have joined together and are attacking us. We are your servants, so don't let us down. Please hurry!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Joshua and his army, including his best warriors, left Gilgal.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">&amp;apos;Joshua,&amp;apos; the Lord said, &amp;apos;don't be afraid of the Amorites. They will run away when you attack, and I will help you defeat them.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Joshua marched all night from Gilgal to Gibeon and made a surprise attack on the Amorite camp.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">The Lord made the enemy panic, and the Israelites started killing them right and left. They chased the Amorite troops up the road to Beth-Horon and kept on killing them, until they reached the towns of Azekah and Makkedah.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">And while these troops were going down through Beth-Horon Pass, the Lord made huge hailstones fall on them all the way to Azekah. More of the enemy soldiers died from the hail than from the Israelite weapons.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Never before and never since has the Lord done anything like that for someone who prayed. The Lord was really fighting for Israel.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">After the battle, Joshua and the Israelites went back to their camp at Gilgal.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">While the enemy soldiers were running from the Israelites, the five enemy kings ran away and hid in a cave near Makkedah.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Joshua's soldiers told him, &amp;apos;The five kings have been found in a cave near Makkedah.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Joshua answered, &amp;apos;Roll some big stones over the mouth of the cave and leave a few soldiers to guard it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">But you and everyone else must keep going after the enemy troops, because they will be safe if they reach their walled towns. Don't let them get away! The Lord our God is helping us get rid of them.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">So Joshua and the Israelites almost wiped out the enemy soldiers. Only a few safely reached their walled towns.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">The Israelite army returned to their camp at Makkedah, where Joshua was waiting for them. No one around there dared say anything bad about the Israelites.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Joshua told his soldiers, &amp;apos;Now, move the rocks from the entrance to the cave and bring those five kings to me.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">The soldiers opened the entrance to the cave and brought out the kings of Jerusalem, Hebron, Jarmuth, Lachish, and Eglon.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">After Joshua had called the army together, he forced the five kings to lie down on the ground. Then he called his officers forward and told them, &amp;apos;You fought these kings along with me, so put your feet on their necks.&amp;apos; The officers did this,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">and Joshua continued, &amp;apos;Don't ever be afraid or discouraged. Be brave and strong. This is what the Lord will do to all your enemies.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">Joshua killed the five kings and told his men to hang each body on a tree. Then at sunset</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">he told some of his troops, &amp;apos;Take the bodies down and throw them into the cave where the kings were found. Cover the entrance to the cave with big rocks.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">Later that day, Joshua captured Makkedah and killed its king and everyone else in the town, just as he had done at Jericho.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">Joshua and his army left Makkedah and attacked the town of Libnah.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">The Lord let them capture the town and its king, and they killed the king and everyone else, just as they had done at Jericho.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">Joshua then led his army to Lachish, and they set up camp around the town. They attacked,</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="36">Joshua and his army left Eglon and attacked Hebron.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">They captured the town and the nearby villages, then killed everyone, including the king. They destroyed Hebron in the same way they had destroyed Eglon.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">Joshua and the Israelite army turned and attacked Debir.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">They captured the town, and its nearby villages. Then they destroyed Debir and killed its king, together with everyone else, just as they had done with Hebron and Libnah.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">Joshua captured towns everywhere in the land: In the central hill country and the foothills to the west, in the Southern Desert and the region that slopes down toward the Dead Sea. Whenever he captured a town, he would kill the king and everyone else, as the Lord God of Israel had commanded.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1">King Jabin of Hazor heard about Joshua's victories, so he sent messages to many nearby kings and asked them to join him in fighting Israel. He sent these messages to King Jobab of Madon, the kings of Shimron and Achshaph,</VERS>

Don't let them frighten you! I'll help you defeat them, and by this time tomorrow they will be dead. Finally, there was peace in the land.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">The Lord told Joshua: When you attack, the first thing you have to do is to cripple their horses. Then after the battle is over, burn their chariots.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Joshua and his army made a surprise attack against the enemy camp at Merom Pond</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Up to this time, the king of Hazor had controlled the kingdoms that had joined together to attack Israel, so Joshua led his army back and captured Hazor. They killed its king</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1">Before Moses died, he and the people of Israel had defeated two kings east of the Jordan River. These kings had ruled the region from the Arnon River gorge in the south to Mount Hermon in the north, including the eastern side of the Jordan River valley. The Israelites defeated the kings of the following towns west of the Jordan River: There were 31 of these kings in all.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">The first king that Moses and the Israelites defeated was an Amorite, King Sihon of Heshbon. The southern border of his kingdom ran down the middle of the Arnon River gorge, taking in the town of Aroer on the northern edge of the gorge. The Jabbok River separated Sihon's kingdom from the Ammonites on the east. Then the Jabbok turned west and became his northern border, so his kingdom included the southern half of the region of Gilead.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Sihon also controlled the eastern side of the Jordan River valley from Lake Galilee south to Beth-Jeshimoth and the Dead Sea. In addition to these regions, he ruled the town called Slopes of Mount Pisgah and the land south of there at the foot of the hill.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Next, Moses and the Israelites defeated King Og of Bashan, who lived in the town of Ashtaroth part of each year and in Edrei the rest of the year. Og was one of the last of the Rephaim.</VERS>

Moses defeated Sihon and killed him and the Midianite chiefs who ruled parts of his kingdom for him. Their names were Evi, Rekem, Zur, Hur, and Reba. The Manasseh tribe is sometimes called the Machir tribe, after Manasseh's son Machir.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="10">Joshua, it was 45 years ago that the Lord told Moses to make that promise, and now I am 85. Even though Israel has moved from place to place in the desert, the Lord has kept me alive all this time as he said he would.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1">Then once again the Israelites started disobeying the Lord , so he let the nation of Midian control Israel for seven years.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">The Midianites were so cruel that many Israelites ran to the mountains and hid in caves. I am the Lord God of Israel, so listen to what I say. You were slaves in Egypt, but I set you free and led you out of Egypt into this land. And when nations here made life miserable for you, I rescued you and helped you get rid of them and take their land. &amp;apos;All right, I'll wait,&amp;apos; the Lord answered. When Gideon looked, the angel was gone.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Every time the Israelites planted crops, the Midianites invaded Israel together with the Amalekites and other eastern nations.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">I am your God, and I told you not to worship Amorite gods, even though you are living in the land of the Amorites. But you refused to listen.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">One day an angel from the Lord went to the town of Ophrah and sat down under the big tree that belonged to Joash, a member of the Abiezer clan. Joash's son Gideon was nearby, threshing grain in a shallow pit, where he could not be seen by the Midianites.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">The angel appeared and spoke to Gideon, &amp;apos;The Lord is helping you, and you are a strong warrior.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Gideon answered, &amp;apos;Please don't take this wrong, but if the Lord is helping us, then why have all of these awful things happened? We've heard how the Lord performed miracles and rescued our ancestors from Egypt. But those things happened long ago. Now the Lord has abandoned us to the Midianites.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Then the Lord himself said, &amp;apos;Gideon, you will be strong, because I am giving you the power to rescue Israel from the Midianites.&amp;apos;</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="16">&amp;apos;Gideon,&amp;apos; the Lord answered, &amp;apos;you can rescue Israel because I am going to help you! Defeating the Midianites will be as easy as beating up one man.&amp;apos;</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="18">And wait here until I bring you an offering.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Gideon went home and killed a young goat, then started boiling the meat. Next, he opened a big sack of flour and made it into thin bread. When the meat was done, he put it in a basket and poured the broth into a clay cooking pot. He took the meat, the broth, and the bread and placed them under the big tree.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="24">Gideon built an altar for worshiping the Lord and called it &amp;apos;The Lord Calms Our Fears.&amp;apos; It still stands there in Ophrah, a town in the territory of the Abiezer clan.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">That night the Lord spoke to Gideon again: Get your father's second-best bull, the one that's seven years old. Use it to pull down the altar where your father worships Baal and cut down the sacred pole next to the altar.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">Then build an altar for worshiping me on the highest part of the hill where your town is built. Use layers of stones for my altar, not just a pile of rocks. Cut up the wood from the pole, make a fire, kill the bull, and burn it as a sacrifice to me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">Gideon chose ten of his servants to help him, and they did everything God had said. But since Gideon was afraid of his family and the other people in Ophrah, he did it all at night.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">When the people of the town got up the next morning, they saw that Baal's altar had been knocked over, and the sacred pole next to it had been cut down. Then they noticed the new altar covered with the remains of the sacrificed bull.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">&amp;apos;Who could have done such a thing?&amp;apos; they asked. And they kept on asking, until finally someone told them, &amp;apos;Gideon the son of Joash did it.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">The men of the town went to Joash and said, &amp;apos;Your son Gideon knocked over Baal's altar and cut down the sacred pole next to it. Hand him over, so we can kill him!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">The crowd pushed closer and closer, but Joash replied, &amp;apos;Are you trying to take revenge for Baal? Are you trying to rescue Baal? If you are, you will be the ones who are put to death, and it will happen before another day dawns. If Baal really is a god, let him take his own revenge on someone who tears down his altar.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">That same day, Joash changed Gideon's name to Jerubbaal, explaining, &amp;apos;He tore down Baal's altar, so let Baal take revenge himself.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">All the Midianites, Amalekites, and other eastern nations got together and crossed the Jordan River. Then they invaded the land of Israel and set up camp in Jezreel Valley.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">The Lord 's Spirit took control of Gideon, and Gideon blew a trumpet as a signal for the men in the Abiezer clan to follow him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">He also sent messengers to the tribes of Manasseh, Asher, Zebulun, and Naphtali, telling the men of these tribes to come and join his army. Then they set out toward the enemy camp.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">And that's just what happened. Early the next morning, Gideon got up and checked the sheep skin. He squeezed out enough water to fill a bowl.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">But Gideon prayed to God again. &amp;apos;Don't be angry with me,&amp;apos; Gideon said. &amp;apos;Let me try this just one more time, so I'll really be sure you'll help me. Only this time, let the skin be dry and the stone floor be wet.&amp;apos;</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="7">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Early the next morning, Gideon and his army got up and moved their camp to Fear Spring. The Midianite camp was to the north, in the valley at the foot of Moreh Hill. Twenty-two thousand men returned home, leaving Gideon with only 10,000 soldiers. Gideon's army camp was on top of a hill overlooking the Midianite camp in the valley. Gideon and Purah worked their way to the edge of the enemy camp, where soldiers were on guard duty. Troops from Ephraim did exactly what Gideon had asked, The men of Ephraim brought the heads of the two Midianite leaders to Gideon.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">The Lord said, &amp;apos;Gideon, your army is too big. I can't let you win with this many soldiers. The Israelites would think that they had won the battle all by themselves and that I didn't have anything to do with it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">So call your troops together and tell them that anyone who is really afraid can leave Mount Gilead and go home.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">&amp;apos;Gideon,&amp;apos; the Lord said, &amp;apos;you still have too many soldiers. Take them down to the spring and I'll test them. I'll tell you which ones can go along with you and which ones must go back home.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">When Gideon led his army down to the spring, the Lord told him, &amp;apos;Watch how each man gets a drink of water. Then divide them into two groups&amp;ndash;those who lap the water like a dog and those who kneel down to drink.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Three hundred men scooped up water in their hands and lapped it, and the rest knelt to get a drink.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">The Lord said, &amp;apos;Gideon, your army will be made up of everyone who lapped the water from their hands. Send the others home. I'm going to rescue Israel by helping you and your army of 300 defeat the Midianites.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Then Gideon gave these orders, &amp;apos;You 300 men stay here. The rest of you may go home, but leave your food and trumpets with us.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">That night, the Lord said to Gideon. &amp;apos;Get up! Attack the Midianite camp. I am going to let you defeat them,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">but if you're still afraid, you and your servant Purah should sneak down to their camp.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">When you hear what the Midianites are saying, you'll be brave enough to attack.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">The camp was huge. The Midianites, Amalekites, and other eastern nations covered the valley like a swarm of locusts. And it would be easier to count the grains of sand on a beach than to count their camels.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Gideon overheard one enemy guard telling another, &amp;apos;I had a dream about a flat loaf of barley bread that came tumbling into our camp. It hit the headquarters tent, and the tent flipped over and fell to the ground.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">The other soldier answered, &amp;apos;Your dream must have been about Gideon, the Israelite commander. It means God will let him and his army defeat the Midianite army and everyone else in our camp.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">As soon as Gideon heard about the dream and what it meant, he bowed down to praise God. Then he went back to the Israelite camp and shouted, &amp;apos;Let's go! The Lord is going to let us defeat the Midianite army.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Gideon divided his little army into three groups of 100 men, and he gave each soldier a trumpet and a large clay jar with a burning torch inside.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Gideon and his group reached the edge of the enemy camp a few hours after dark, just after the new guards had come on duty. Gideon and his soldiers blew their trumpets and smashed the clay jars that were hiding the torches.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">The rest of Gideon's soldiers blew the trumpets they were holding in their right hands. Then they smashed the jars and held the burning torches in their left hands. Everyone shouted, &amp;apos;Fight with your swords for the Lord and for Gideon!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">The enemy soldiers started yelling and tried to run away. Gideon's troops stayed in their positions surrounding the camp</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">and blew their trumpets again. As they did, the Lord made the enemy soldiers pull out their swords and start fighting each other. The enemy army tried to escape from the camp. They ran to Acacia Tree Town, toward Zeredah, and as far as the edge of the land that belonged to the town of Abel-Meholah near Tabbath.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">Gideon sent word for more Israelite soldiers to come from the tribes of Naphtali, Asher, and both halves of Manasseh to help fight the Midianites.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">He also sent messengers to tell all the men who lived in the hill country of Ephraim, &amp;apos;Come and help us fight the Midianites! Put guards at every spring, stream, and well, as far as Beth-Barah before the Midianites can get to them. And guard the Jordan River.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">and they even helped chase the Midianites on the east side of the Jordan River. These troops captured Raven and Wolf, the two Midianite leaders. They killed Raven at a large rock that has come to be known as Raven Rock, and they killed Wolf near a wine-pit that has come to be called Wolf Wine-Pit.</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="8">
			<VERS vnumber="1">But the men were really upset with Gideon and complained, &amp;apos;When you went to war with Midian, you didn't ask us to help! Why did you treat us like that?&amp;apos; Don't be upset! Even though you came later, you were able to do much more than I did. It's just like the grape harvest: The grapes your tribe doesn't even bother to pick are better than the best grapes my family can grow. By the time Gideon had finished talking, the men of Ephraim had calmed down and were no longer angry with him. &amp;apos;They were a lot like you,&amp;apos; the two kings answered. &amp;apos;They were dignified, almost like royalty.&amp;apos; Gideon jumped up and killed them both. Then he took the gold ornaments from the necks of their camels. The Midianites had been defeated so badly that they were no longer strong enough to attack Israel. And so Israel was at peace for the remaining 40 years of Gideon's life.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Gideon answered:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Besides, God chose you to capture Raven and Wolf. I didn't do a thing compared to you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">After Gideon and his 300 troops had chased the Midianites across the Jordan River, they were exhausted.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">The town of Succoth was nearby, so he went there and asked, &amp;apos;Please give my troops some food. They are worn out, but we have to keep chasing Zebah and Zalmunna, the two Midianite kings.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">The town leaders of Succoth answered, &amp;apos;Why should we feed your army? We don't know if you really will defeat Zebah and Zalmunna.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">&amp;apos;Just wait!&amp;apos; Gideon said. &amp;apos;After the Lord helps me defeat them, I'm coming back here. I'll make a whip out of thorns and rip the flesh from your bones.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">After leaving Succoth, Gideon went to Penuel and asked the leaders there for some food. But he got the same answer as he did at Succoth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">&amp;apos;I'll come back safe and sound,&amp;apos; Gideon said, &amp;apos;but when I do, I'm going to tear down your tower!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Zebah and Zalmunna were in Karkor with an army of 15,000 troops. They were all that was left of the army of the eastern nations, because 120,000 of their warriors had been killed in the battle.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Gideon reached the enemy camp by going east along Nomad Road past Nobah and Jogbehah. He made a surprise attack,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">and the enemy panicked. Zebah and Zalmunna tried to escape, but Gideon chased and captured them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">After the battle, Gideon set out for home. As he was going through Heres Pass,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">he caught a young man who lived in Succoth. Gideon asked him who the town officials of Succoth were, and the young man wrote down 77 names.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Gideon went to the town officials and said, &amp;apos;Here are Zebah and Zalmunna. Remember how you made fun of me? You said, &amp;quot;We don't know if you really will defeat those two Midianite kings. So why should we feed your worn-out army?&amp;quot; &amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Gideon made a whip from thorn plants and used it to beat the town officials.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Afterwards he went to Penuel, where he tore down the tower and killed all the town officials.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Then Gideon said, &amp;apos;Zebah and Zalmunna, tell me about the men you killed at Tabor.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">&amp;apos;They were my very own brothers!&amp;apos; Gideon said. &amp;apos;I swear by the living Lord that if you had let them live, I would let you live.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Gideon turned to Jether, his oldest son. &amp;apos;Kill them!&amp;apos; Gideon said. But Jether was young, and he was too afraid to even pull out his sword. The enemy soldiers had been Ishmaelites, and they wore gold earrings.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">&amp;apos;What's the matter, Gideon?&amp;apos; Zebah and Zalmunna asked. &amp;apos;Do it yourself, if you're not too much of a coward!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">After the battle with the Midianites, the Israelites said, &amp;apos;Gideon, you rescued us! Now we want you to be our king. Then after your death, your son and then your grandson will rule.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">&amp;apos;No,&amp;apos; Gideon replied, &amp;apos;I won't be your king, and my son won't be king either. Only the Lord is your ruler.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">But I will ask you to do one thing: Give me all the earrings you took from the enemy.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">The Israelite soldiers replied, &amp;apos;Of course we will give you the earrings.&amp;apos; Then they spread out a robe on the ground and tossed the earrings on it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">The total weight of this gold was nearly 20 kilograms. In addition, there was the gold from the camels' ornaments and from the beautiful jewelry worn by the Midianite kings. Gideon also took their purple robes.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">Gideon had many wives and 70 sons.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">He even had a wife who lived at Shechem. They had a son, and Gideon named him Abimelech.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">Gideon lived to be an old man. And when he died, he was buried in the family tomb in his hometown of Ophrah, which belonged to the Abiezer clan.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">Soon after Gideon's death, the Israelites turned their backs on God again. They set up idols of Baal and worshiped Baal Berith as their god.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">The Israelites forgot that the Lord was their God, and that he had rescued them from the enemies who lived around them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">Besides all that, the Israelites were unkind to Gideon's family, even though Gideon had done so much for Israel.</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="9">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Abimelech the son of Gideon went to Shechem. While there, he met with his mother's relatives</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">and told them to say to the leaders of Shechem, &amp;apos;Do you think it would be good to have all 70 of Gideon's sons ruling us? Wouldn't you rather have just one man be king? Abimelech would make a good king, and he's related to us.&amp;apos; Abimelech used the silver to hire a gang of rough soldiers who would do anything for money. Leaders of Shechem, listen to me, and maybe God will listen to you. for someone to be king; they asked the olive tree, &amp;apos;Will you be our king?&amp;apos; &amp;apos;My oil brings honor to people and gods. I won't stop making oil, just so my branches can wave above the other trees.&amp;apos; &amp;apos;Will you be our king?&amp;apos; &amp;apos;I won't stop growing my delicious fruit, just so my branches can wave above the other trees.&amp;apos; &amp;apos;Will you be our king?&amp;apos; &amp;apos;My wine brings cheer to people and gods. I won't stop making wine, just so my branches can wave above the other trees.&amp;apos; to the thornbush and asked, &amp;apos;Will you be our king?&amp;apos; &amp;apos;If you really want me to be your king, then come into my shade and I will protect you. But if you're deceiving me, I'll start a fire that will spread out and destroy After Jotham had finished telling this story, he said: So God turned the leaders of Shechem against Abimelech. Hamor was the founder of Shechem, and one of his descendants should be our ruler. But Abimelech's father was Gideon, so Abimelech isn't really one of us. He shouldn't be our king, and we shouldn't have to obey him or Zebul, who rules Shechem for him. Gaal the son of Ebed has come to Shechem along with his brothers, and they have persuaded the people to let Gaal rule Shechem instead of you. &amp;apos;No,&amp;apos; Zebul answered, &amp;apos;it's just the shadows of the mountains. It only looks like people moving.&amp;apos; So the soldier ran his sword through Abimelech.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Abimelech's uncles talked it over with the leaders of Shechem who agreed, &amp;apos;Yes, it would be better for one of our relatives to be king.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Then they gave Abimelech 70 pieces of silver from the temple of their god Baal Berith.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Abimelech and his soldiers went to his father's home in Ophrah and brought out Gideon's other sons to a large rock, where they murdered all 70 of them. Gideon's youngest son Jotham hid from the soldiers, but he was the only one who escaped.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">The leaders of Shechem, including the priests and the military officers, met at the tree next to the sacred rock in Shechem to crown Abimelech king.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Jotham heard what they were doing. So he climbed to the top of Mount Gerizim and shouted down to the people who were there at the meeting:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Once the trees searched</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">But the olive tree replied,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Then they asked the fig tree,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">But the fig tree replied,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Next they asked the grape vine,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">But the grape vine replied,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Finally, they went</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">The thornbush replied, the cedars of Lebanon.&amp;apos; And was it right to make Abimelech your king? He's merely the son of my father's slave girl. But just because he's your relative, you made him king of Shechem.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">So, you leaders of Shechem, if you treated Gideon and his family the way you should have, then I hope you and Abimelech will make each other very happy.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">But if it was wrong to treat Gideon and his family the way you did, then I pray that Abimelech will destroy you with fire, and I pray that you will do the same to him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Jotham ran off and went to live in the town of Beer, where he could be safe from his brother Abimelech.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Abimelech had been a military commander of Israel for three years,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">Then they sent some men to hide on the hilltops and watch for Abimelech and his troops, while they sent others to rob everyone that went by on the road. But Abimelech found out what they were doing.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">One day, Gaal son of Ebed went to live in Shechem. His brothers moved there too, and soon the leaders of Shechem started trusting him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">The time came for the grape harvest, and the people of Shechem went into their vineyards and picked the grapes. They gathered the grapes and made wine. Then they went into the temple of their god and threw a big party. There was a lot of eating and drinking, and before long they were cursing Abimelech.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">Gaal said:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">If I were the ruler of Shechem, I'd get rid of that Abimelech. I'd tell him, &amp;apos;Get yourself an even bigger army, and we will still defeat you.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">Zebul was angry when he found out what Gaal had said.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">And so he sent some messengers to Abimelech. But they had to pretend to be doing something else, or they would not have been allowed to leave Shechem. Zebul told the messengers to say:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">This is what I think you should do. Lead your army here during the night and hide in the fields.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">Get up the next morning at sunrise and rush out of your hiding places to attack the town. Gaal and his followers will come out to fight you, but you will easily defeat them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">So one night, Abimelech led his soldiers to Shechem. He divided them into four groups, and they all hid near the town.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">The next morning, Gaal went out and stood in the opening of the town gate. Abimelech and his soldiers left their hiding places,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">and Gaal saw them. Zebul was standing there with Gaal, and Gaal remarked, &amp;apos;Zebul, that looks like a crowd of people coming down from the mountaintops.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">&amp;apos;But Zebul, look over there,&amp;apos; Gaal said. &amp;apos;There's a crowd coming down from the sacred mountain, and another group is coming along the road from the tree where people talk with the spirits of the dead.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">Then Zebul replied, &amp;apos;What good is all of your bragging now? You were the one who said Abimelech shouldn't be the ruler of Shechem. Out there is the army that you made fun of. So go out and fight them!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">Gaal and the leaders of Shechem went out and fought Abimelech.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">Soon the people of Shechem turned and ran back into the town. However, Abimelech and his troops were close behind and killed many of them along the way.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">Abimelech stayed at Arumah, and Zebul forced Gaal and his brothers out of Shechem.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">The next morning, the people of Shechem were getting ready to work in their fields as usual, but someone told Abimelech about it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43">Abimelech divided his army into three groups and set up an ambush in the fields near Shechem. When the people came out of the town, he and his army rushed out from their hiding places and attacked.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44">Abimelech and the troops with him ran to the town gate and took control of it, while two other groups attacked and killed the people who were in the fields.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45">He and his troops fought in Shechem all day, until they had killed everyone in town. Then he and his men tore down the houses and buildings and scattered salt everywhere.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46">Earlier that day, the leaders of the temple of El Berith at Shechem had heard about the attack. So they went into the temple fortress,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="47">but Abimelech found out where they were.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="48">He led his troops to Mount Zalmon, where he took an ax and chopped off a tree branch. He lifted the branch onto his shoulder and shouted, &amp;apos;Hurry! Cut off a branch just as I did.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="49">When they all had branches, they followed Abimelech back to Shechem. They piled the branches against the fortress and set them on fire, burning down the fortress and killing about 1,000 men and women.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="50">After destroying Shechem, Abimelech went to Thebez. He surrounded the town and captured it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="51">But there was a tall fortress in the middle of the town, and the town leaders and everyone else went inside. Then they barred the gates and went up to the flat roof.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="52">Abimelech and his army rushed to the fortress and tried to force their way inside. Abimelech himself was about to set the heavy wooden doors on fire,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="53">when a woman on the roof dropped a large rock on his head and cracked his skull.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="54">The soldier who carried his weapons was nearby, and Abimelech told him, &amp;apos;Take out your sword and kill me. I don't want people to say that I was killed by a woman!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="55">And when the Israelite soldiers saw that their leader was dead, they went back home.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="56">That's how God punished Abimelech for killing his brothers and bringing shame on his father's family.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="57">God also punished the people of Shechem for helping Abimelech. Everything happened just as Jotham's curse said it would.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1">Tola was the next person to rescue Israel. He belonged to the Issachar tribe, but he lived in Shamir, a town in the hill country of Ephraim. His father was Puah, and his grandfather was Dodo.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Tola was a leader of Israel for 23 years, then he died and was buried in Shamir.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">The next leader of Israel was Jair, who lived in Gilead. He was a leader for 22 years.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">He had 30 sons, and each son had his own mule and was in charge of one town in Gilead. Those 30 towns are still called The Settlements of Jair.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">When he died, he was buried in the town of Kamon.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Before long, the Israelites began disobeying the Lord by worshiping Baal, Astarte, and gods from Syria, Sidon, Moab, Ammon, and Philistia.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">The Lord was angry with Israel and decided to let Philistia and Ammon conquer them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">So the same year that Jair died, Israel's army was crushed by these two nations. For 18 years, Ammon was cruel to the Israelites who lived in Gilead, the region east of the Jordan River that had once belonged to the Amorites.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Then the Ammonites began crossing the Jordan and attacking the tribes of Judah, Benjamin, and Ephraim. Life was miserable for the Israelites.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">They begged the Lord for help and confessed, &amp;apos;We were unfaithful to you, our Lord . We stopped worshiping you and started worshiping idols of Baal.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">&amp;apos;We have been unfaithful to you,&amp;apos; the Israelites admitted. &amp;apos;If we must be punished, do it yourself, but please rescue us from the Ammonites.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Then the Israelites got rid of the idols of the foreign gods, and they began worshiping only the Lord . Finally, there came a time when the Lord could no longer stand to see them suffer.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">The rulers of Ammon called their soldiers together and led them to Gilead, where they set up camp.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">The leaders of Gilead asked each other, &amp;apos;Who can lead an attack on the Ammonites?&amp;apos; Then they agreed, &amp;apos;If we find someone who can lead the attack, we'll make him the ruler of Gilead.&amp;apos;</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="8">&amp;apos;But we do want you to come back,&amp;apos; the leaders said. &amp;apos;And if you lead us in battle against the Ammonites, we will make you the ruler of Gilead.&amp;apos;</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="11">So Jephthah went back to Mizpah with the leaders of Gilead. The people of Gilead gathered at the place of worship and made Jephthah their ruler. Jephthah also made promises to them.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="13">The king of Ammon replied, &amp;apos;Tell Jephthah that the land really belongs to me, all the way from the Arnon River in the south, to the Jabbok River in the north, and west to the Jordan River. When the Israelites came out of Egypt, they stole it. Tell Jephthah to return it to me, and there won't be any war.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Jephthah sent the messengers back to the king of Ammon,</VERS>

They also sent messengers to the king of Moab, but he wouldn't let them cross his country either. And so the Israelites stayed at Kadesh.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">A little later, the Israelites set out into the desert, going east of Edom and Moab, and camping on the eastern side of the Arnon River gorge. The Arnon is the eastern border of Moab, and since the Israelites didn't cross it, they didn't even set foot in Moab.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">The Israelites sent messengers to the Amorite King Sihon of Heshbon. &amp;apos;Please,&amp;apos; they said, &amp;apos;let our people go through your country to get to our own land.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Sihon didn't think the Israelites could be trusted, so he called his army together. They set up camp at Jahaz, then they attacked the Israelite camp.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">But the Lord God helped Israel defeat Sihon and his army. Israel took over all of the Amorite land where Sihon's people had lived,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">from the Arnon River in the south to the Jabbok River in the north, and from the desert in the east to the Jordan River in the west.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="26">For 300 years, Israelites have been living in Heshbon and Aroer and the nearby villages, and in the towns along the Arnon River gorge. If the land really belonged to you Ammonites, you wouldn't have waited until now to try to get it back.</VERS>

Just for that, we're going to burn down your house with you inside!&amp;apos; So Jephthah called together the army of Gilead, then they attacked and defeated the army from Ephraim. Whenever one of the men from Ephraim would try to cross the river, the guards would say, &amp;apos;Are you from Ephraim?&amp;apos; &amp;apos;No,&amp;apos; the man would answer, &amp;apos;I'm not from Ephraim.&amp;apos; If the man said &amp;apos;Sibboleth,&amp;apos; the guards would grab him and kill him right there. Altogether, 42,000 men from Ephraim were killed in the battle and at the Jordan. Ibzan was a leader for seven years,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">&amp;apos;But I did ask for your help,&amp;apos; Jephthah answered. &amp;apos;That was back when the people of Gilead and I were having trouble with the Ammonites, and you wouldn't do a thing to help us.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="12">Manoah then asked, &amp;apos;When your promise comes true, what rules must he obey and what will be his work?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">&amp;apos;Your wife must be careful to do everything I told her,&amp;apos; the Lord 's angel answered.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">&amp;apos;She must not eat or drink anything made from grapes. She must not drink wine or beer or eat anything forbidden by God's laws. I told her exactly what to do.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">&amp;apos;Please,&amp;apos; Manoah said, &amp;apos;stay here with us for just a little while, and we'll fix a young goat for you to eat.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Manoah didn't realize that he was really talking to one of the Lord 's angels.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Manoah said, &amp;apos;Tell us your name, so we can honor you after our son is born.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">&amp;apos;No,&amp;apos; the angel replied. &amp;apos;You don't need to know my name. And if you did, you couldn't understand it.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">So Manoah took a young goat over to a large rock he had chosen for an altar, and he built a fire on the rock. Then he killed the goat, and offered it with some grain as a sacrifice to the Lord . But then an amazing thing happened.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">The fire blazed up toward the sky, and the Lord 's angel went up toward heaven in the fire. Manoah and his wife bowed down low when they saw what happened.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Although the angel didn't appear to them again, they realized he was one of the Lord 's angels.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="23">&amp;apos;The Lord isn't going to kill us,&amp;apos; Manoah's wife responded. &amp;apos;The Lord accepted our sacrifice and grain offering, and he let us see something amazing. Besides, he told us that we're going to have a son.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">Later, Manoah's wife did give birth to a son, and she named him Samson. As the boy grew, the Lord blessed him.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1">One day, Samson went to Timnah, where he saw a Philistine woman.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">When he got back home, he told his parents, &amp;apos;I saw a Philistine woman in Timnah, and I want to marry her. Get her for me!&amp;apos; &amp;apos;She looks good to me,&amp;apos; Samson answered. &amp;apos;Get her for me!&amp;apos; &amp;apos;It's a bet!&amp;apos; the Philistines said. &amp;apos;Tell us the riddle.&amp;apos; Once so strong and mighty&amp;ndash; now so sweet and tasty! Three days went by, and the Philistine young men had not come up with the right answer. &amp;apos;But I haven't even told my parents the answer!&amp;apos; Samson replied. &amp;apos;Why should I tell you?&amp;apos; A lion is the strongest&amp;ndash; honey is the sweetest! Samson replied, This answer you have given me doubtless came from my bride-to-be.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">His parents answered, &amp;apos;There are a lot of women in our clan and even more in the rest of Israel. Those Philistines are pagans. Why would you want to marry one of their women?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">At that time, the Philistines were in control of Israel, and the Lord wanted to stir up trouble for them. That's why he made Samson desire that woman.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">As Samson and his parents reached the vineyards near Timnah, a fierce young lion suddenly roared and attacked Samson.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">But the Lord 's Spirit took control of Samson, and with his bare hands he tore the lion apart, as though it had been a young goat. His parents didn't know what he had done, and he didn't tell them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">When they got to Timnah, Samson talked to the woman, and he was sure that she was the one for him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Later, Samson returned to Timnah for the wedding. And when he came near the place where the lion had attacked, he left the road to see what was left of the lion. He was surprised to see that bees were living in the lion's skeleton, and that they had made some honey.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">He scooped up the honey in his hands and ate some of it as he walked along. When he got back to his parents, he gave them some of the honey, and they ate it too. But he didn't tell them he had found the honey in the skeleton of a lion.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">While Samson's father went to make the final arrangements with the bride and her family, Samson threw a big party, as grooms usually did.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">When the Philistines saw what Samson was like, they told 30 of their young men to stay with him at the party.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Samson told the 30 young men, &amp;apos;This party will last for seven days. Let's make a bet: I'll tell you a riddle, and if you can tell me the answer before the party is over, I'll give each of you a shirt and a full change of clothing.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">But if you can't tell me the answer, then each of you will have to give me a shirt and a full change of clothing.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Samson said:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Finally, on the seventh day of the party they went to Samson's bride and said, &amp;apos;You had better trick your husband into telling you the answer to his riddle. Have you invited us here just to rob us? If you don't find out the answer, we will burn you and your family to death.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Samson's bride went to him and started crying in his arms. &amp;apos;You must really hate me,&amp;apos; she sobbed. &amp;apos;If you loved me at all, you would have told me the answer to your riddle.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">For the entire seven days of the party, she had been whining and trying to get the answer from him. But that seventh day she put so much pressure on Samson that he finally gave in and told her the answer. She went straight to the young men and told them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Before sunset that day, the men of the town went to Samson with this answer:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Then the Lord 's Spirit took control of Samson. He went to Ashkelon, where he killed 30 men and took their clothing. Samson then gave it to the 30 young men at Timnah and stormed back home to his own family.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">The father of the bride made Samson's wife marry one of the 30 young men that had been at Samson's party.</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="15">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Later, during the wheat harvest, Samson went to visit the young woman he thought was still his wife. He brought along a young goat as a gift and said to her father, &amp;apos;I want to go into my wife's bedroom.&amp;apos; &amp;apos;You can't do that,&amp;apos; he replied. &amp;apos;It was Samson,&amp;apos; someone told them. &amp;apos;He married the daughter of that man in Timnah, but then the man gave Samson's wife to one of the men at the wedding.&amp;apos; Samson left Philistia and went to live in the cave at Etam Rock. The Philistines answered, &amp;apos;We've come to get Samson. We're going to do the same things to him that he did to our people.&amp;apos; &amp;apos;I was only getting even with them,&amp;apos; Samson replied. &amp;apos;They did the same things to me first.&amp;apos; &amp;apos;I won't put up a fight,&amp;apos; Samson answered, &amp;apos;but you have to promise not to hurt me yourselves.&amp;apos; When the Philistines saw that Samson was being brought to their camp at Jawbone, they started shouting and ran toward him. But the Lord 's Spirit took control of Samson, and Samson broke the ropes, as though they were pieces of burnt cloth. I used a donkey's jawbone to kill a thousand men; I beat them with this jawbone</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">&amp;apos;When you left the way you did, I thought you were divorcing her. So I arranged for her to marry one of the young men who were at your party. But my younger daughter is even prettier, and you can have her as your wife.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">&amp;apos;This time,&amp;apos; Samson answered, &amp;apos;I have a good reason for really hurting some Philistines.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Samson went out and caught 300 foxes and tied them together in pairs with oil-soaked rags around their tails.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Then Samson took the foxes into the Philistine wheat fields that were ready to be harvested. He set the rags on fire and let the foxes go. The wheat fields went up in flames, and so did the stacks of wheat that had already been cut. Even the Philistine vineyards and olive orchards burned.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Some of the Philistines started asking around, &amp;apos;Who could have done such a thing?&amp;apos; The Philistine leaders went to Timnah and burned to death Samson's wife and her father. over and over again. Samson named the place Caller Spring, because he had called out to God for help. The spring is still there at Jawbone.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">When Samson found out what they had done, he went to them and said, &amp;apos;You killed them! And I won't rest until I get even with you.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Then Samson started hacking them to pieces with his sword.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">But it wasn't long before the Philistines invaded Judah and set up a huge army camp at Jawbone.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">The people of Judah asked, &amp;apos;Why have you invaded our land?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Three thousand men from Judah went to the cave at Etam Rock and said to Samson, &amp;apos;Don't you know that the Philistines rule us, and they will punish us for what you did?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">&amp;apos;We came here to tie you up and turn you over to them,&amp;apos; said the men of Judah.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Samson glanced around and spotted the jawbone of a donkey. The jawbone had not yet dried out, so it was still hard and heavy. Samson grabbed it and started hitting Philistines&amp;ndash;he killed 1,000 of them!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">After the fighting was over, he made up this poem about what he had done to the Philistines:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Samson tossed the jawbone on the ground and decided to call the place Jawbone Hill. It is still called that today.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Samson was so thirsty that he prayed, &amp;apos;Our Lord , you helped me win a battle against a whole army. Please don't let me die of thirst now. Those heathen Philistines will carry off my dead body.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Samson was tired and weary, but God sent water gushing from a rock. Samson drank some and felt strong again.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Samson was a leader of Israel for 20 years, but the Philistines were still the rulers of Israel.</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="16">
			<VERS vnumber="1">One day while Samson was in Gaza, he saw a prostitute and went to her house to spend the night.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">The people who lived in Gaza found out he was there, and they decided to kill him at sunrise. So they went to the city gate and waited all night in the guardrooms on each side of the gate. Delilah tied up Samson with the bowstrings and shouted, &amp;apos;Samson, the Philistines are attacking!&amp;apos; Samson snapped the bowstrings, as though they were pieces of scorched string. The Philistines had not found out why Samson was so strong. Samson snapped the ropes as if they were threads. Samson woke up and pulled the loom free from its posts in the ground and from the nails in the wall. Then he pulled his hair free from the woven cloth. The Philistine rulers went to Delilah's house, and they brought along the silver they had promised her. Samson woke up and thought, &amp;apos;I'll break loose and escape, just as I always do.&amp;apos; He did not realize that the Lord had stopped helping him. Samson was our enemy, but our god Dagon helped us capture him! The rulers had Samson brought from the prison, and when the people saw him, this is how they praised their god: Samson ruined our crops and killed our people. He was our enemy, but our god helped us capture him. They made fun of Samson for a while, then they told him to stand near the columns that supported the roof.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">But Samson got up in the middle of the night and went to the town gate. He pulled the gate doors and doorposts out of the wall and put them on his shoulders. Then he carried them all the way to the top of the hill that overlooks Hebron, where he set the doors down, still closed and locked.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Some time later, Samson fell in love with a woman named Delilah, who lived in Sorek Valley.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">The Philistine rulers went to Delilah and said, &amp;apos;Trick Samson into telling you what makes him so strong and what can make him weak. Then we can tie him up so he can't get away. If you find out his secret, we will each give you 1,100 pieces of silver.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">The next time Samson was at Delilah's house, she asked, &amp;apos;Samson, what makes you so strong? How can I tie you up so you can't get away? Come on, you can tell me.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Samson answered, &amp;apos;If someone ties me up with seven new bowstrings that have never been dried, it will make me just as weak as anyone else.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">&amp;apos;You lied and made me look like a fool,&amp;apos; Delilah said. &amp;apos;Now tell me. How can I really tie you up?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Samson answered, &amp;apos;Use some new ropes. If I'm tied up with ropes that have never been used, I'll be just as weak as anyone else.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Delilah got new ropes, and again some Philistines hid in the room. Then she tied up Samson's arms and shouted, &amp;apos;Samson, the Philistines are attacking!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">&amp;apos;You're still lying and making a fool of me,&amp;apos; Delilah said. &amp;apos;Tell me how I can tie you up!&amp;apos; &amp;apos;My hair is in seven braids,&amp;apos; Samson replied. &amp;apos;If you weave my braids into the threads on a loom and nail the loom to a wall, then I will be as weak as anyone else.&amp;apos; Samson was a leader of Israel for 20 years.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">While Samson was asleep, Delilah wove his braids into the threads on a loom and nailed the loom to a wall. Then she shouted, &amp;apos;Samson, the Philistines are attacking!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">&amp;apos;Samson,&amp;apos; Delilah said, &amp;apos;you claim to love me, but you don't mean it! You've made me look like a fool three times now, and you still haven't told me why you are so strong.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Delilah started nagging and pestering him day after day, until he couldn't stand it any longer.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Finally, Samson told her the truth. &amp;apos;I have belonged to God ever since I was born, so my hair has never been cut. If it were ever cut off, my strength would leave me, and I would be as weak as anyone else.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Delilah realized that he was telling the truth. So she sent someone to tell the Philistine rulers, &amp;apos;Come to my house one more time. Samson has finally told me the truth.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Delilah had lulled Samson to sleep with his head resting in her lap. She signaled to one of the Philistine men as she began cutting off Samson's seven braids. And by the time she was finished, Samson's strength was gone. Delilah tied him up</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">and shouted, &amp;apos;Samson, the Philistines are attacking!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">The Philistines grabbed Samson and poked out his eyes. They took him to the prison in Gaza and chained him up. Then they put him to work, turning a millstone to grind grain.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">But they didn't cut his hair any more, so it started growing back.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">The Philistine rulers threw a big party and sacrificed a lot of animals to their god Dagon. The rulers said:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">A young man was leading Samson by the hand, and Samson said to him, &amp;apos;I need to lean against something. Take me over to the columns that hold up the roof.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">The Philistine rulers were celebrating in a temple packed with people and with 3,000 more on the flat roof. They had all been watching Samson and making fun of him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">Samson prayed, &amp;apos;Please remember me, Lord God. The Philistines poked out my eyes, but make me strong one last time, so I can take revenge for at least one of my eyes!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">Samson was standing between the two middle columns that held up the roof. He felt around and found one column with his right hand, and the other with his left hand.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">Then he shouted, &amp;apos;Let me die with the Philistines!&amp;apos; He pushed against the columns as hard as he could, and the temple collapsed with the Philistine rulers and everyone else still inside. Samson killed more Philistines when he died than he had killed during his entire life.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">His brothers and the rest of his family went to Gaza and took his body back home. They buried him in his father's tomb, which was located between Zorah and Eshtaol.</VERS>

Well, I'm the one who did it.&amp;apos; His mother answered, &amp;apos;I pray that the Lord will bless you, my son.&amp;apos; But Micah handed it back to his mother. She took 200 pieces of the silver and gave them to a silver worker, who made them into an idol. They kept the idol in Micah's house. &amp;apos;I am a Levite from Bethlehem in Judah,&amp;apos; the man answered, &amp;apos;and I'm on my way to find a new place to live.&amp;apos; The young man went for a walk,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">He had a shrine for worshiping God there at his home, and he had made some idols and a sacred priestly vest. Micah chose one of his own sons to be the priest for his shrine.</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="18">
			<VERS vnumber="1">These things happened before kings ruled Israel. About this time, the tribe of Dan was looking for a place to live. The other tribes had land, but the people of Dan did not really have any to call their own. The warriors left the area of Zorah and Eshtaol and went into the hill country of Ephraim. One night they stayed at Micah's house, When they came close to Micah's house, &amp;apos;Hey!&amp;apos; the priest shouted. &amp;apos;What do you think you're doing?&amp;apos; They turned to face him and asked, &amp;apos;What's wrong? Why did you bring all these men?&amp;apos; Micah realized there was no way he could win a fight with them, and so he went back home. The warriors from Dan made a surprise attack on Laish, killing everyone and burning it down. Then they rebuilt the town and settled there themselves.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">The tribe chose five warriors to represent their clans and told them, &amp;apos;Go and find some land where we can live.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">because they heard the young Levite talking, and they knew from his accent that he was from the south. They asked him, &amp;apos;What are you doing here? Who brought you here?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">The Levite replied, &amp;apos;Micah hired me as his priest.&amp;apos; Then he told them how well Micah had treated him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">&amp;apos;Please talk to God for us,&amp;apos; the men said. &amp;apos;Ask God if we will be successful in what we are trying to do.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">&amp;apos;Don't worry,&amp;apos; answered the priest. &amp;apos;The Lord is pleased with what you are doing.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">The five men left and went to the town of Laish, whose people were from Sidon, but Sidon was too far away to protect them. Even though their town had no walls, the people thought they were safe from attack. So they had not asked anyone else for protection, which meant that the tribe of Dan could easily take over Laish.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">The five men went back to Zorah and Eshtaol, where their relatives asked, &amp;apos;Did you find any land?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Six hundred men from the tribe of Dan strapped on their weapons and left Zorah and Eshtaol with their families.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">One night they camped near Kiriath-Jearim in the territory of Judah, and that's why the place just west of Kiriath-Jearim is still known as Dan's Camp.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Then they went into the hill country of Ephraim.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">the five men who had been spies asked the other warriors, &amp;apos;Did you know that someone in this village has several idols and a sacred priestly vest? What do you think we should do about it?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">&amp;apos;Quiet!&amp;apos; the men said. &amp;apos;Keep your mouth shut and listen. Why don't you come with us and be our priest, so you can tell us what God wants us to do? You could stay here and be a priest for one man's family, but wouldn't you rather be the priest for a clan or even a whole tribe of Israel?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">The priest really liked that idea. So he took the vest and the idols and joined the others</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">from the tribe of Dan. Then they turned and left, after putting their children, their cattle, and the rest of their other possessions in front.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">They had traveled for some time before Micah asked his neighbors to help him get his things back. He and his men caught up with the people of Dan</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="25">&amp;apos;We don't want to hear any more about it,&amp;apos; the people of Dan said. &amp;apos;And if you make us angry, you'll only get yourself and your family killed.&amp;apos;</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1">Before kings ruled Israel, a Levite was living deep in the hill country of the Ephraim tribe. He married a woman from Bethlehem in Judah,</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="3">her husband decided to try and talk her into coming back. So he went to Bethlehem, taking along a servant and two donkeys. He talked with his wife, and she invited him into her family's home. Her father was glad to see him</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">and did not want him to leave. So the man stayed three days, eating and drinking with his father-in-law.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">When everyone got up on the fourth day, the Levite started getting ready to go home. But his father-in-law said, &amp;apos;Don't leave until you have a bite to eat. You'll need strength for your journey.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">The two men sat down together and ate a big meal. &amp;apos;Come on,&amp;apos; the man's father-in-law said. &amp;apos;Stay tonight and have a good time.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">The Levite tried to leave, but his father-in-law insisted, and he spent one more night there.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">The fifth day, the man got up early to leave, but his wife's father said, &amp;apos;You need to keep up your strength! Why don't you leave right after lunch?&amp;apos; So the two of them started eating.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Finally, the Levite got up from the meal, so he and his wife and servant could leave. &amp;apos;Look,&amp;apos; his father-in-law said, &amp;apos;it's already late afternoon, and if you leave now, you won't get very far before dark. Stay with us one more night and enjoy yourself. Then you can get up early tomorrow morning and start home.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">But the Levite decided not to spend the night there again. He had the saddles put on his two donkeys, then he and his wife and servant traveled as far as Jebus, which is now called Jerusalem.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="12">&amp;apos;No,&amp;apos; the Levite answered. &amp;apos;They aren't Israelites, and I refuse to spend the night there. We'll stop for the night at Gibeah,</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="14">They walked on and reached Gibeah in the territory of Benjamin just after sunset.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="19">We brought food for our donkeys and bread and wine for ourselves, so we don't need anything except a place to sleep.&amp;apos;</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="4">The husband of the murdered woman answered: My wife and I went into the town of Gibeah in Benjamin to spend the night. The Israelites were running away, but they headed for Baal-Tamar, where they regrouped. They had set an ambush, and they were sure it would work. Ten thousand of Israel's best soldiers had been hiding west of Gibeah, and as soon as the men of Benjamin chased the Israelites into the countryside, these 10,000 soldiers made a surprise attack on the town gates. They dashed in and captured Gibeah, killing everyone there. Then they set the town on fire, because the smoke would be the signal for the other Israelite soldiers to turn and attack the soldiers of Benjamin. The fighting had been so heavy around the soldiers of Benjamin, that they did not know the trouble they were in. But then they looked back and saw clouds of smoke rising from the town. They looked in front and saw the soldiers of Israel turning to attack. This terrified them, because they realized that something horrible was happening. And it was horrible&amp;ndash;over 25,000 soldiers of Benjamin died that day, and those who were left alive knew that the Lord had given Israel the victory.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Later that night, the men of Gibeah surrounded the house. They wanted to kill me, but instead they raped and killed my wife.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">It was a terrible thing for Israelites to do! So I cut up her body and sent the pieces everywhere in Israel.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">You are the people of Israel, and you must decide today what to do about the men of Gibeah.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">The whole army was in agreement, and they said, &amp;apos;None of us will go home.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Everyone agreed that Gibeah had to be punished.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">The tribes of Israel sent messengers to every town and village in Benjamin. And wherever the messengers went, they said, &amp;apos;How could those worthless men in Gibeah do such a disgusting thing?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">We can't allow such a terrible crime to go unpunished in Israel! Hand the men over to us, and we will put them to death.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Men from towns all over Benjamin's territory went to Gibeah and got ready to fight Israel.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">The Benjamin tribe had 26,000 soldiers, not counting the 700 who were Gibeah's best warriors.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">In this army there were 700 left-handed experts who could sling a rock at a target the size of a hair and hit it every time.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">The other Israelite tribes organized their army and found they had 400,000 experienced soldiers.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">So they went to the place of worship at Bethel and asked God, &amp;apos;Which tribe should be the first to attack the people of Benjamin?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">The next morning the Israelite army moved its camp to a place near Gibeah.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Then they left their camp and got into position to attack the army of Benjamin.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Benjamin's soldiers came out of Gibeah and attacked, and when the day was over, 22,000 Israelite soldiers lay dead on the ground.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">That same day, Benjamin's soldiers came out of Gibeah and attacked, leaving another 18,000 Israelite soldiers dead on the battlefield.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">The Israelites surrounded Gibeah, but stayed where they could not be seen.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">Then the next day, they took the same positions as twice before,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">The men of Benjamin headed down the road toward the desert, trying to escape from the Israelites. But the Israelites stayed right behind them, keeping up their attack. Men even came out of the nearby towns to help kill the men of Benjamin,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43">who were having to fight on all sides. The Israelite soldiers never let up their attack. They chased and killed the warriors of Benjamin as far as a place directly east of Gibeah,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44">until 18,000 of these warriors lay dead.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45">Some other warriors of Benjamin turned and ran down the road toward Rimmon Rock in the desert. The Israelites killed 5,000 of them on the road, then chased the rest until they had killed 2,000 more.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46">Twenty-five thousand soldiers of Benjamin died that day, all of them experienced warriors.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="47">Only 600 of them finally made it into the desert to Rimmon Rock, where they stayed for four months.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="48">The Israelites turned back and went to every town in Benjamin's territory, killing all the people and animals, and setting the towns on fire.</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="21">
			<VERS vnumber="1">When the Israelites had met at Mizpah before the war with Benjamin, they had made this sacred promise: &amp;apos;None of us will ever let our daughters marry any man from Benjamin.&amp;apos; After asking around, they discovered that no one had come from Jabesh in Gilead. All the women of the Benjamin tribe were killed. How can we get wives for the men of Benjamin who are left? Go to Shiloh and hide in the vineyards near the festival.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">After the war with Benjamin, the Israelites went to the place of worship at Bethel and sat there until sunset. They cried loudly and bitterly</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">and prayed, &amp;apos;Our Lord , you are the God of Israel. Why did you let this happen? Now one of our tribes is almost gone.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Early the next morning, the Israelites built an altar and offered sacrifices to please the Lord and to ask his blessing.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Then they asked each other, &amp;apos;Did any of the tribes of Israel fail to come to the place of worship? We made a sacred promise that anyone who didn't come to the meeting at Mizpah would be put to death.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">The Israelites were sad about what had happened to the Benjamin tribe, and they said, &amp;apos;One of our tribes was almost wiped out.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Only a few men of Benjamin weren't killed in the war. We need to get wives for them, so the tribe won't completely disappear. But how can we do that, after promising in the Lord 's name that we wouldn't let them marry any of our daughters?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">The warriors attacked Jabesh in Gilead, and returned to their camp at Shiloh in Canaan with 400 young women.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">The Israelites met and sent messengers to the men of Benjamin at Rimmon Rock, telling them that the Israelites were willing to make peace with them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">So the men of Benjamin came back from Rimmon Rock, and the Israelites let them marry the young women from Jabesh. But there weren't enough women.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">The Israelites were very sad, because the Lord had almost wiped out one of their tribes.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Then their leaders said:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">If they don't have children, one of the Israelite tribes will die out.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">But we can't let the men of Benjamin marry any of our daughters. We made a sacred promise not to do that, and if we break our promise, we will be under our own curse.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Then someone suggested, &amp;apos;What about the Lord 's Festival that takes place each year in Shiloh? It's held north of Bethel, south of Lebonah, and just east of the road that goes from Bethel to Shechem.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">The leaders told the men of Benjamin who still did not have wives:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Wait there for the young women of Shiloh to come out and perform their dances. Then rush out and grab one of the young women, then take her home as your wife.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">If the fathers or brothers of these women complain about this, we'll say, &amp;apos;Be kind enough to let those men keep your daughter. After all, we couldn't get enough wives for all the men of Benjamin in the battle at Jabesh. And because you didn't give them permission to marry your daughters, you won't be under the curse we earlier agreed on.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">The men of Benjamin went to Shiloh and hid in the vineyards. The young women soon started dancing, and each man grabbed one of them and carried her off. Then the men of Benjamin went back to their own land and rebuilt their towns and started living in them again.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">Afterwards, the rest of the Israelites returned to their homes and families.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="7">She asked if she could pick up grain left by the harvest workers, and she has been working all morning without a moment's rest.&amp;apos;</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="10">Ruth bowed down to the ground and said, &amp;apos;You know I come from another country. Why are you so good to me?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Boaz answered, &amp;apos;I've heard how you've helped your mother-in-law ever since your husband died. You even left your own father and mother to come and live in a foreign land among people you don't know.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">I pray that the Lord God of Israel will reward you for what you have done. And now that you have come to him for protection, I pray that he will bless you.&amp;apos;</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="14">At mealtime Boaz said to Ruth, &amp;apos;Come, eat with us. Have some bread and dip it in the sauce.&amp;apos; At once she sat down with the workers, and Boaz handed her some roasted grain. Ruth ate all she wanted and had some left over.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1">One day, Naomi said to Ruth: It's time I found you a husband, who will give you a home and take care of you. The Lord bless you!

			<VERS vnumber="16">Naomi asked her what had happened, and Ruth told her everything.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1">In the meanwhile, Boaz had gone to the meeting place at the town gate and was sitting there when the other close relative came by. So Boaz invited him to come over and sit down, and he did.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Then Boaz got ten of the town leaders and also asked them to sit down. After they had sat down,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">he said to the man: Naomi has come back from Moab and is selling the land that belonged to her husband Elimelech. The man replied, &amp;apos;I'll buy it!&amp;apos; All of you are witnesses that today I have bought from Naomi the property that belonged to Elimelech and his two sons, Chilion and Mahlon. We are witnesses to this. And we pray that the Lord will give your wife many children, just as he did Leah and Rachel, the wives of Jacob. May you be a rich man in the tribe of Ephrath and an important man in Bethlehem. Praise the Lord ! Today he has given you a grandson to take care of you. We pray that the boy will grow up to be famous everywhere in Israel. When Obed grew up he had a son named Jesse, who later became the father of King David.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">I'm telling you about this, since you are his closest relative and have the right to buy the property. If you want it, you can buy it now. These ten men and the others standing here can be witnesses. But if you don't want the property, let me know, because I am next in line.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">&amp;apos;If you do buy it from Naomi,&amp;apos; Boaz told him, &amp;apos;you must also marry Ruth. Then if you have a son by her, the property will stay in the family of Ruth's first husband.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">The man answered, &amp;apos;If that's the case, I don't want to buy it! That would make problems with the property I already own. You may buy it yourself, because I cannot.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">To make a sale legal in those days, one person would take off a sandal and give it to the other.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">So after the man had agreed to let Boaz buy the property, he took off one of his sandals and handed it to Boaz.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Boaz told the town leaders and everyone else:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">You are also witnesses that I have agreed to marry Mahlon's widow Ruth, the Moabite woman. This will keep the property in his family's name, and he will be remembered in this town.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">The town leaders and the others standing there said:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">May the children you have by this young woman make your family as famous as the family of Perez, the son of Tamar and Judah.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Boaz married Ruth, and the Lord blessed her with a son.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">After his birth, the women said to Naomi:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">He will make you happy and take care of you in your old age, because he is the son of your daughter-in-law. And she loves you more than seven sons of your own would love you.</VERS>

Eli told him, &amp;apos;Son, I didn't call you. Go back to sleep.&amp;apos; Eli finally realized that it was the Lord who was speaking to Samuel. Once again Samuel went back and lay down. &amp;apos;I'm listening,&amp;apos; Samuel answered. &amp;apos;What do you want me to do?&amp;apos; Samuel, I am going to do something in Israel that will shock everyone who hears about it! &amp;apos;Yes, sir!&amp;apos; Samuel answered.</VERS>

Nothing like this has ever happened to us before. Eli was afraid that something might happen to the sacred chest. So he was sitting on his chair beside the road, just waiting. The soldier hurried over and told Eli, &amp;apos;Young man, what happened?&amp;apos; Eli asked. She didn't pay any attention to them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">The Philistines made a fierce attack. They defeated the Israelites and killed about 4,000 of them.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="3">&amp;apos;Don't send it back without a gift,&amp;apos; the priests and fortunetellers answered. &amp;apos;Send along something to Israel's God to make up for taking the chest in the first place.

			<VERS vnumber="4">&amp;apos;What should we send?&amp;apos; the Philistines asked.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">So make five gold models of the sores and five gold models of the rats that are wiping out your crops. If you honor the God of Israel with this gift, maybe he will stop causing trouble for you and your gods and your crops.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="9">Watch to see if the chest goes on up the road to the Israelite town of Beth-Shemesh. If it goes back to its own country, you will know that it was the Lord who made us suffer so badly. But if the chest doesn't go back to its own country, then the Lord had nothing to do with the disease that hit us&amp;ndash;it was simply bad luck.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">The Philistines followed their advice. They hitched up the two cows to the cart, but they kept their calves in a barn.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Then they put the chest on the cart, along with the bag that had the gold rats and sores in it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">The cows went straight up the road toward Beth-Shemesh, mooing as they went. The Philistine rulers followed them until they got close to Beth-Shemesh.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">The people of Beth-Shemesh were harvesting their wheat in the valley. When they looked up and saw the chest, they were so happy that they stopped working and started celebrating.</VERS>

The Israelites were afraid when they heard that the Philistines were coming. For as long as Samuel lived, the Lord helped Israel fight the Philistines.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">One day, Samuel told all the people of Israel, &amp;apos;If you really want to turn back to the Lord , then prove it.

He's wondering how he can find you.&amp;apos; Saul answered, &amp;apos;Looking for the donkeys. We couldn't find them, so we went to talk with Samuel.&amp;apos; The Lord God of Israel told me to remind you that he had rescued you from the Egyptians and from the other nations that abused you. &amp;apos;Yes,&amp;apos; the Lord answered, &amp;apos;he is hiding behind the baggage.&amp;apos; The crowd shouted, &amp;apos;Long live the king!&amp;apos;</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="11">Some people who had known Saul for a long time saw that he was speaking and behaving like a prophet. They said to each other, &amp;apos;What's happened? How can Saul be a prophet?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">&amp;apos;Why not?&amp;apos; one of them answered. &amp;apos;Saul has as much right to be a prophet as anyone else!&amp;apos; That's why everyone started saying, &amp;apos;How can Saul be a prophet?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">After Saul stopped prophesying, he went to the place of worship.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Later, Saul's uncle asked him, &amp;apos;Where have you been?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">&amp;apos;And what did he tell you?&amp;apos; Saul's uncle asked.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Saul answered, &amp;apos;He told us the donkeys had been found.&amp;apos; But Saul didn't mention that Samuel had chosen him to be king.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Samuel sent messengers to tell the Israelites to come to Mizpah and meet with the Lord .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">When everyone had arrived, Samuel said:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">God has rescued you from your troubles and hard times. But you have rejected your God and have asked for a king. Now each tribe and clan must come near the place of worship so the Lord can choose a king.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Samuel brought each tribe, one after the other, to the altar, and the Lord chose the Benjamin tribe.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Next, Samuel brought each clan of Benjamin there, and the Lord chose the Matri clan. Finally, Saul the son of Kish was chosen. But when they looked for him, he was nowhere to be found.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">The people prayed, &amp;apos;Our Lord , is Saul here?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">The people ran and got Saul and brought him into the middle of the crowd. He was more than a head taller than anyone else.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">&amp;apos;Look closely at the man the Lord has chosen!&amp;apos; Samuel told the crowd. &amp;apos;There is no one like him!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">Samuel explained the rights and duties of a king and wrote them all in a book. He put the book in one of the shrines where the Lord was worshiped. Then Samuel sent everyone home.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">God had encouraged some young men to become followers of Saul, and when he returned to his hometown of Gibeah, they went with him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">But some worthless fools said, &amp;apos;How can someone like Saul rescue us from our enemies?&amp;apos; They did not want Saul to be their king, and so they didn't bring him any gifts. But Saul kept calm.</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="11">
			<VERS vnumber="1">About this time, King Nahash of Ammon came with his army and surrounded the town of Jabesh in Gilead. The people who lived there told Nahash, &amp;apos;If you will sign a peace treaty with us, you can be our ruler, and we will pay taxes to you.&amp;apos; &amp;apos;Why is everyone crying?&amp;apos; Saul asked. They told him what the men from Jabesh had said. The Lord made the people of Israel terribly afraid. So all the men came together Everyone was encouraged!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Nahash answered, &amp;apos;Sure, I'll sign a treaty! But not before I insult Israel by poking out the right eye of every man who lives in Jabesh.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">The town leaders said, &amp;apos;Give us seven days so we can send messengers everywhere in Israel to ask for help. If no one comes here to save us, we will surrender to you.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Some of the messengers went to Gibeah, Saul's hometown. They told what was happening at Jabesh, and everyone in Gibeah started crying.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Just then, Saul came in from the fields, walking behind his oxen.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Then the Spirit of God suddenly took control of Saul and made him furious.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Saul killed two of his oxen, cut them up in pieces, and gave the pieces to the messengers. He told them to show the pieces to everyone in Israel and say, &amp;apos;Saul and Samuel are getting an army together. Come and join them. If you don't, this is what will happen to your oxen!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">at Bezek. Saul had them organized and counted. There were 300,000 from Israel and 30,000 from Judah.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Saul and his officers sent the messengers back to Jabesh with this promise: &amp;apos;We will rescue you tomorrow afternoon.&amp;apos; The messengers went back to the people at Jabesh and told them that they were going to be rescued.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">So they told the Ammonites, &amp;apos;We will surrender to you tomorrow, and then you can do whatever you want to.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">The next day, Saul divided his army into three groups and attacked before daylight. They started killing Ammonites and kept it up until afternoon. A few Ammonites managed to escape, but they were scattered far from each other.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">The Israelite soldiers went to Samuel and demanded, &amp;apos;Where are the men who said they didn't want Saul to be king? Bring them to us, and we will put them to death!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">&amp;apos;No you won't!&amp;apos; Saul told them. &amp;apos;The Lord rescued Israel today, and no one will be put to death.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">&amp;apos;Come on!&amp;apos; Samuel said. &amp;apos;Let's go to Gilgal and make an agreement that Saul will continue to be our king.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Everyone went to the place of worship at Gilgal, where they agreed that Saul would be their king. Saul and the people sacrificed animals to ask for the Lord 's blessing, and they had a big celebration.</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="12">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Samuel told the Israelites: I have given you a king, just as you asked. &amp;apos;That's true,&amp;apos; they replied. The Lord brought your ancestors out of Egypt and chose Moses and Aaron to be your leaders. Even though what you did was wrong, you don't need to be afraid. But you must always follow the Lord and worship him with all your heart.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">You have seen how I have led you ever since I was a young man. I'm already old. My hair is gray, and my own sons are grown. Now you must see how well your king will lead you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Let me ask this. Have I ever taken anyone's ox or donkey or forced you to give me anything? Have I ever hurt anyone or taken a bribe to give an unfair decision? Answer me so the Lord and his chosen king can hear you. And if I have done any of these things, I will give it all back.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">&amp;apos;No,&amp;apos; the Israelites answered. &amp;apos;You've never cheated us in any way!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Samuel said, &amp;apos;The Lord and his chosen king are witnesses to what you have said.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Then Samuel told them:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Now the Lord will be your judge. So stand here and listen, while I remind you how often the Lord has saved you and your ancestors from your enemies.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">After Jacob went to Egypt, your ancestors cried out to the Lord for help, and he sent Moses and Aaron. They brought your ancestors out of Egypt and led them here to settle this land.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">But your ancestors forgot the Lord , so he let them be defeated by the Philistines, the king of Moab, and Sisera, the commander of Hazor's army.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Again your ancestors cried out to the Lord for help. They said, &amp;apos;We have sinned! We stopped worshiping you, our Lord , and started worshiping Baal and Astarte. But now, if you rescue us from our enemies, we will worship you.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">The Lord sent Gideon, Bedan, Jephthah, and Samuel to rescue you from your enemies, and you didn't have to worry about being attacked.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Then you saw that King Nahash of Ammon was going to attack you. And even though the Lord your God is your king, you told me, &amp;apos;This time it's different. We want a king to rule us!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">You asked for a king, and you chose one. Now he stands here where all of you can see him. But it was really the Lord who made him your king.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">If you and your king want to be followers of the Lord , you must worship him and do what he says. Don't be stubborn!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">If you're stubborn and refuse to obey the Lord , he will turn against you and your king.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Just stand here and watch the Lord show his mighty power.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Isn't this the dry season? I'm going to ask the Lord to send a thunderstorm. When you see it, you will realize how wrong you were to ask for a king.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Samuel prayed, and that same day the Lord sent a thunderstorm. Everyone was afraid of the Lord and of Samuel.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">They told Samuel, &amp;apos;Please, pray to the Lord your God for us! We don't want to die. We have sinned many times in the past, and we were very wrong to ask for a king.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Samuel answered:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Don't worship idols! They don't have any power, and they can't help you or save you when you're in trouble.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">But the Lord has chosen you to be his own people. He will always take care of you so that everyone will know how great he is.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">I would be disobeying the Lord if I stopped praying for you! I will always teach you how to live right.</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="13">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Saul was a young man when he became king, and he ruled Israel for two years.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Then he chose 3,000 men from Israel to be full-time soldiers and sent everyone else home. Two thousand of these troops stayed with him in the hills around Michmash and Bethel. The other 1,000 were stationed with Jonathan at Gibeah in the territory of Benjamin. Saul stayed at Gilgal. His soldiers were shaking with fear, Saul killed one of the animals, Saul answered, &amp;apos;My soldiers were leaving in all directions, and you didn't come when you were supposed to. The Philistines were gathering at Michmash, The Philistine army was camped at Michmash.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Jonathan led an attack on the Philistine army camp at Geba. The Philistine camp was destroyed, but the other Philistines heard what had happened. Then Saul told his messengers, &amp;apos;Go to every village in the country. Give a signal with the trumpet, and when the people come together, tell them what has happened.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">The messengers then said to the people of Israel, &amp;apos;Saul has destroyed the Philistine army camp at Geba. Now the Philistines really hate Israel, so every town and village must send men to join Saul's army at Gilgal.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">The Philistines called their army together to fight Israel. They had 3,000 chariots, 6,000 cavalry, and as many foot soldiers as there are grains of sand on the beach. They went to Michmash and set up camp there east of Beth-Aven.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">The Israelite army realized that they were outnumbered and were going to lose the battle. Some of the Israelite men hid in caves or in clumps of bushes, and some ran to places where they could hide among large rocks. Others hid in tombs or in deep dry pits.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Still others went to Gad and Gilead on the other side of the Jordan River.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">and they were starting to run off and leave him. Saul waited there seven days, just as Samuel had ordered him to do, but Samuel did not come.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Finally, Saul commanded, &amp;apos;Bring me some animals, so we can offer sacrifices to please the Lord and ask for his help.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">and just as he placed it on the altar, Samuel arrived. Saul went out to welcome him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">&amp;apos;What have you done?&amp;apos; Samuel asked.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">and I was worried that they would attack me here at Gilgal. I hadn't offered a sacrifice to ask for the Lord 's help, so I forced myself to offer a sacrifice on the altar fire.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">&amp;apos;That was stupid!&amp;apos; Samuel said. &amp;apos;You didn't obey the Lord your God. If you had obeyed him, someone from your family would always have been king of Israel.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">But no, you disobeyed, and so the Lord won't choose anyone else from your family to be king. In fact, he has already chosen the one he wants to be the next leader of his people.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Then Samuel left Gilgal. Part of Saul's army had not deserted him, and he led them to Gibeah in Benjamin to join his other troops. Then he counted them and found that he still had 600 men.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Saul, Jonathan, and their army set up camp at Geba in Benjamin.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Each day they sent out patrols to attack and rob villages and then destroy them. One patrol would go north along the road to Ophrah in the region of Shual.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Another patrol would go west along the road to Beth-Horon. A third patrol would go east toward the desert on the road to the ridge that overlooks Zeboim Valley.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">The Philistines would not allow any Israelites to learn how to make iron tools. &amp;apos;If we allowed that,&amp;apos; they said, &amp;apos;those worthless Israelites would make swords and spears.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">So, whenever the Israelite soldiers had to go into battle, none of them had a sword or a spear except Saul and his son Jonathan.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">The Philistines moved their camp to the pass at Michmash,</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="14">
			<VERS vnumber="6">Jonathan and the soldier who carried his weapons talked as they went toward the Philistine camp. &amp;apos;It's just the two of us against all those godless men,&amp;apos; Jonathan said. &amp;apos;But the Lord can help a few soldiers win a battle just as easily as he can help a whole army. Maybe the Lord will help us win this battle.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">&amp;apos;Do whatever you want,&amp;apos; the soldier answered. &amp;apos;I'll be right there with you.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">&amp;apos;This is what we will do,&amp;apos; Jonathan said. &amp;apos;We will go across and let them see us.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">If they agree to come down the hill and fight where we are, then we won't climb up to their camp.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">But we will go if they tell us to come up the hill and fight. That will mean the Lord is going to help us win.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Jonathan crawled up the hillside with the soldier right behind him. When they got to the top, Jonathan killed the Philistines who attacked from the front, and the soldier killed those who attacked from behind.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Before they had gone 30 meters, they had killed about 20 Philistines.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">The whole Philistine army panicked&amp;ndash;those in camp, those on guard duty, those in the fields, and those on raiding patrols. All of them were afraid and confused. Then God sent an earthquake, and the ground began to tremble.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Saul's lookouts at Geba saw that the Philistine army was running in every direction, like melted wax.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Saul told his officers, &amp;apos;Call the roll and find out who left our camp.&amp;apos; When they had finished, they found out that Jonathan and the soldier who carried his weapons were missing.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">At that time, Ahijah was serving as priest for the army of Israel, and Saul told him, &amp;apos;Come over here! Let's ask God what we should do.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Just as Saul finished saying this, he could see that the Philistine army camp was getting more and more confused, and he said, &amp;apos;Ahijah, never mind!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Saul quickly called his army together, then led them to the Philistine camp. By this time the Philistines were so confused that they were killing each other.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">There were also some hired soldiers in the Philistine camp, who now switched to Israel's side and fought for Saul and Jonathan.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Many Israelites had been hiding in the hill country of Ephraim. And when they heard that the Philistines were running away, they came out of hiding and joined in chasing the Philistines.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">Jonathan did not know about Saul's warning to the soldiers. So he dipped the end of his walking stick in the honey and ate some with his fingers. He felt stronger and more alert.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">Then a soldier told him, &amp;apos;Your father swore that anyone who ate food today would be put under a curse, and we agreed not to eat. That's why we're so weak.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">Jonathan said, &amp;apos;My father has caused you a lot of trouble. Look at me! I ate only a little of this honey, but already I feel strong and alert.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">I wish you had eaten some of the food the Philistines left behind. We would have been able to kill a lot more of them.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">By evening the Israelite army was exhausted from killing Philistines all the way from Michmash to Aijalon.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">They grabbed the food they had captured from the Philistines and started eating. They even killed sheep and cows and calves right on the spot and ate the meat without draining the blood.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">Someone told Saul, &amp;apos;Look! The army is disobeying the Lord by eating meat before the blood drains out.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">Then tell everyone in camp to bring their cattle and lambs to me. They can kill the animals on this rock, then eat the meat. That way no one will disobey the Lord by eating meat with blood still in it.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">It was the first altar Saul had built for offering sacrifices to the Lord .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">Saul said, &amp;apos;Let's attack the Philistines again while it's still dark. We can fight them all night. Let's kill them and take everything they own!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">Saul asked God, &amp;apos;Should I attack the Philistines? Will you help us win?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">Saul called his army officers together and said, &amp;apos;We have to find out what sin has kept God from answering.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">I swear by the living Lord that whoever sinned must die, even if it turns out to be my own son Jonathan.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">Saul told his army, &amp;apos;You stand on that side of the priest, and Jonathan and I will stand on the other side.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">Then Saul prayed, &amp;apos;Our Lord , God of Israel, why haven't you answered me today? Please show us who sinned. Was it my son Jonathan and I, or was it your people Israel?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">Saul told Ahijah, &amp;apos;Now ask the Lord to decide between Jonathan and me.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43">&amp;apos;Jonathan,&amp;apos; Saul exclaimed, &amp;apos;tell me what you did!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44">&amp;apos;Yes, Jonathan. I swear to God that you must die.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45">&amp;apos;No!&amp;apos; the soldiers shouted. &amp;apos;God helped Jonathan win the battle for us. We won't let you kill him. We swear to the Lord that we won't let you kill him or even lay a hand on him!&amp;apos; So the army kept Saul from killing Jonathan.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46">Saul stopped hunting down the Philistines, and they went home.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="52">Saul was at war with the Philistines for as long as he lived. Whenever he found a good warrior or a brave man, Saul made him join his army.</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="15">
			<VERS vnumber="1">One day, Samuel told Saul: The Lord told me to choose you to be king of his people, Israel. Now listen to this message from the Lord : The Kenites left, Samuel was angry, and he cried out in prayer to the Lord all night. &amp;apos;All right,&amp;apos; Saul answered. The Lord was sorry he had made Saul the king of Israel.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">&amp;apos;When the Israelites were on their way out of Egypt, the nation of Amalek attacked them. I am the Lord All-Powerful, and now I am going to make Amalek pay!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">&amp;apos;Go and attack the Amalekites! Destroy them and all their possessions. Don't have any pity. Kill their men, women, children, and even their babies. Slaughter their cattle, sheep, camels, and donkeys.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Saul sent messengers who told every town and village to send men to join the army at Telaim. There were 210,000 troops in all, and 10,000 of these were from Judah. Saul organized them,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">then led them to a valley near one of the towns in Amalek, where they got ready to make a surprise attack.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Some Kenites lived nearby, and Saul told them, &amp;apos;Your people were kind to our nation when we left Egypt, and I don't want you to get killed when I wipe out the Amalekites. So stay away from them.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">and Saul attacked the Amalekites from Havilah to Shur, which is just east of Egypt.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Every Amalekite was killed except King Agag.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Saul and his army let Agag live, and they also spared the best sheep and cattle. They didn't want to destroy anything of value, so they only killed the animals that were worthless or weak.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">The Lord told Samuel,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">&amp;apos;Saul has stopped obeying me, and I'm sorry that I made him king.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Early the next morning he went to talk with Saul. Someone told him, &amp;apos;Saul went to Carmel, where he had a monument built so everyone would remember his victory. Then he left for Gilgal.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Samuel finally caught up with Saul, and Saul told him, &amp;apos;I hope the Lord will bless you! I have done what the Lord told me.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">&amp;apos;Then why,&amp;apos; Samuel asked, &amp;apos;do I hear sheep and cattle?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">&amp;apos;The army took them from the Amalekites,&amp;apos; Saul explained. &amp;apos;They kept the best sheep and cattle, so they could sacrifice them to the Lord your God. But we destroyed everything else.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">&amp;apos;Stop!&amp;apos; Samuel said. &amp;apos;Let me tell you what the Lord told me last night.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Samuel continued, &amp;apos;You may not think you're very important, but the Lord chose you to be king, and you are in charge of the tribes of Israel.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">When the Lord sent you on this mission, he told you to wipe out those worthless Amalekites.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Why didn't you listen to the Lord ? Why did you keep the animals and make him angry?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">&amp;apos;But I did listen to the Lord !&amp;apos; Saul answered. &amp;apos;He sent me on a mission, and I went. I captured King Agag and destroyed his nation.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">All the animals were going to be destroyed anyway. That's why the army brought the best sheep and cattle to Gilgal as sacrifices to the Lord your God.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">&amp;apos;Tell me,&amp;apos; Samuel said. &amp;apos;Does the Lord really want sacrifices and offerings? No! He doesn't want your sacrifices. He wants you to obey him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">Rebelling against God or disobeying him because you are proud is just as bad as worshiping idols or asking them for advice. You refused to do what God told you, so God has decided that you can no longer be king.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">&amp;apos;I have sinned,&amp;apos; Saul admitted. &amp;apos;I disobeyed both you and the Lord . I was afraid of the army, and I listened to them instead.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">Please forgive me and come back with me so I can worship the Lord .&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">&amp;apos;No!&amp;apos; Samuel replied, &amp;apos;You disobeyed the Lord , and I won't go back with you. Now the Lord has said that you can't be king of Israel any longer.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">As Samuel turned to go, Saul grabbed the edge of Samuel's robe. It tore!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">Samuel said, &amp;apos;The Lord has torn the kingdom of Israel away from you today, and he will give it to someone who is better than you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">Besides, the eternal God of Israel isn't a human being. He doesn't tell lies or change his mind.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">Saul said, &amp;apos;I did sin, but please honor me in front of the leaders of the army and the people of Israel. Come back with me, so I can worship the Lord your God.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">Samuel followed Saul back, and Saul worshiped the Lord .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">Then Samuel shouted, &amp;apos;Bring me King Agag of Amalek!&amp;apos; Agag came in chains, and he was saying to himself, &amp;apos;Surely they won't kill me now.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">But Samuel said, &amp;apos;Agag, you have snatched children from their mothers' arms and killed them. Now your mother will be without children.&amp;apos; Then Samuel chopped Agag to pieces at the place of worship in Gilgal.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="5">&amp;apos;Yes, it is!&amp;apos; Samuel answered. &amp;apos;I've come to offer a sacrifice to the Lord . Get yourselves ready to take part in the sacrifice and come with me.&amp;apos; Samuel also invited Jesse and his sons to come to the sacrifice, and he got them ready to take part.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="7">But the Lord told him, &amp;apos;Samuel, don't think Eliab is the one just because he's tall and handsome. He isn't the one I've chosen. People judge others by what they look like, but I judge people by what is in their hearts.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Jesse told his son Abinadab to go over to Samuel, but Samuel said, &amp;apos;No, the Lord hasn't chosen him.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Next, Jesse sent his son Shammah to him, and Samuel said, &amp;apos;The Lord hasn't chosen him either.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">One by one, Jesse told all seven of his sons to go over to Samuel. Finally, Samuel said, &amp;apos;Jesse, the Lord hasn't chosen any of these young men.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Do you have any other sons?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Jesse sent for David. He was a healthy, good-looking boy with a sparkle in his eyes. As soon as David came, the Lord told Samuel, &amp;apos;He's the one! Get up and pour the olive oil on his head.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Samuel poured the oil on David's head while his brothers watched. At that moment, the Spirit of the Lord took control of David and stayed with him from then on.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">The Spirit of the Lord had left Saul, and an evil spirit from the Lord was terrifying him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">&amp;apos;It's an evil spirit from God that's frightening you,&amp;apos; Saul's officials told him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">&amp;apos;Your Majesty, let us go and look for someone who is good at playing the harp. He can play for you whenever the evil spirit from God bothers you, and you'll feel better.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">&amp;apos;All right,&amp;apos; Saul answered. &amp;apos;Find me someone who is good at playing the harp and bring him here.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">&amp;apos;A man named Jesse who lives in Bethlehem has a son who can play the harp,&amp;apos; one official said. &amp;apos;He's a brave warrior, he's good-looking, he can speak well, and the Lord is with him.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Saul sent a message to Jesse: &amp;apos;Tell your son David to leave your sheep and come here to me.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Jesse loaded a donkey with bread and a goatskin full of wine, then he told David to take the donkey and a young goat to Saul.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">David went to Saul and started working for him. Saul liked him so much that he put David in charge of carrying his weapons.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Not long after this, Saul sent another message to Jesse: &amp;apos;I really like David. Please let him stay with me.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">Whenever the evil spirit from God bothered Saul, David would play his harp. Saul would relax and feel better, and the evil spirit would go away.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1">The Philistines got ready for war and brought their troops together to attack the town of Socoh in Judah. They set up camp at Ephes-Dammim, between Socoh and Azekah.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">The Philistine army had a hero named Goliath who was from the town of Gath and was about three meters tall.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">and his spear was so big that the iron spearhead alone weighed about seven kilograms. A soldier always walked in front of Goliath to carry his shield.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Goliath went out and shouted to the army of Israel:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">If he can kill me, our people will be your slaves. But if I kill him, your people will be our slaves.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Here and now I challenge Israel's whole army! Choose someone to fight me!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Saul and his men heard what Goliath said, but they were so frightened of Goliath that they couldn't do a thing.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">David's father Jesse was an old man, who belonged to the Ephrath clan and lived in Bethlehem in Judah. Jesse had eight sons:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">He took care of his father's sheep, and he went back and forth between Bethlehem and Saul's camp.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Goliath came out and gave his challenge every morning and every evening for 40 days.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">One day, Jesse told David, &amp;apos;Hurry and take this sack of roasted grain and these ten loaves of bread to your brothers at the army camp.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">And here are ten large chunks of cheese to take to their commanding officer. Find out how your brothers are doing and bring back something that shows that they're all right.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">They're with Saul's army, fighting the Philistines in Elah Valley.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">David obeyed his father. He got up early the next morning and left someone else in charge of the sheep; then he loaded the supplies and started off. He reached the army camp just as the soldiers were taking their places and shouting the battle cry.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">The army of Israel and the Philistine army stood there facing each other.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">David left his things with the man in charge of supplies and ran up to the battle line to ask his brothers if they were well.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">While David was talking with them, Goliath came out from the line of Philistines and started boasting as usual. David heard him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">When the Israelite soldiers saw Goliath, they were scared and ran off.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">They said to each other, &amp;apos;Look how he keeps coming out to insult us. The king is offering a big reward to the man who kills Goliath. That man will even get to marry the king's daughter, and no one in his family will ever have to pay taxes again.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">David asked some soldiers standing nearby, &amp;apos;What will a man get for killing this Philistine and stopping him from insulting our people? Who does that worthless Philistine think he is? He's making fun of the army of the living God!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">The soldiers told David what the king would give the man who killed Goliath.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">David's oldest brother Eliab heard him talking with the soldiers. Eliab was angry with him and said, &amp;apos;What are you doing here, anyway? Who's taking care of your little flock of sheep out in the desert? You spoiled brat! You came here just to watch the fighting, didn't you?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">&amp;apos;Now what have I done?&amp;apos; David answered. &amp;apos;Can't I even ask a question?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">Then he turned and asked another soldier the same thing he had asked the others, and he got the same answer.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">Some soldiers overheard David talking, so they told Saul what David had said. Saul sent for David, and David came.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">&amp;apos;Your Majesty,&amp;apos; he said, &amp;apos;this Philistine shouldn't turn us into cowards. I'll go out and fight him myself!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">&amp;apos;You don't have a chance against him,&amp;apos; Saul replied. &amp;apos;You're only a boy, and he's been a soldier all his life.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">But David told him:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">I go after it and beat the wild animal until it lets the sheep go. If the wild animal turns and attacks me, I grab it by the throat and kill it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">Sir, I have killed lions and bears that way, and I can kill this worthless Philistine. He shouldn't have made fun of the army of the living God!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">The Lord has rescued me from the claws of lions and bears, and he will keep me safe from the hands of this Philistine.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">Saul had his own military clothes and armor put on David, and he gave David a bronze helmet to wear.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">David strapped on a sword and tried to walk around, but he was not used to wearing those things.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">and picked up his shepherd's stick. He went out to a stream and picked up five smooth rocks and put them in his leather bag. Then with his sling in his hand, he went straight toward Goliath.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">Goliath came toward David, walking behind the soldier who was carrying his shield.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">When Goliath saw that David was just a healthy, good-looking boy, he made fun of him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43">&amp;apos;Do you think I'm a dog?&amp;apos; Goliath asked. &amp;apos;Is that why you've come after me with a stick?&amp;apos; He cursed David in the name of the Philistine gods</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44">and shouted, &amp;apos;Come on! When I'm finished with you, I'll feed you to the birds and wild animals!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45">David answered:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46">Today the Lord will help me defeat you. I'll knock you down and cut off your head, and I'll feed the bodies of the other Philistine soldiers to the birds and wild animals. Then the whole world will know that Israel has a real God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="47">Everybody here will see that the Lord doesn't need swords or spears to save his people. The Lord always wins his battles, and he will help us defeat you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="48">When Goliath started forward, David ran toward him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="49">He put a rock in his sling and swung the sling around by its straps. When he let go of one strap, the rock flew out and hit Goliath on the forehead. It cracked his skull, and he fell facedown on the ground.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="50">David defeated Goliath with a sling and a rock. He killed him without even using a sword.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="51">David ran over and pulled out Goliath's sword. Then he used it to cut off Goliath's head.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="52">But the soldiers of Israel and Judah let out a battle cry and went after them as far as Gath and Ekron. The bodies of the Philistines were scattered all along the road from Shaaraim to Gath and Ekron.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="57">When David came back from fighting Goliath, he was still carrying Goliath's head.</VERS>

		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="18">
			<VERS vnumber="1">David and Saul finished talking, and soon David and Jonathan became best friends. Jonathan thought as much of David as he did of himself.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">From that time on, Saul kept David in his service and would not let David go back to his own family. Saul has killed a thousand enemies; David has killed ten thousand! King Saul had set a time limit, and before it ran out,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Jonathan liked David so much that they promised to always be loyal friends.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Jonathan took off the robe that he was wearing and gave it to David. He also gave him his military clothes, his sword, his bow and arrows, and his belt.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">David was a success in everything that Saul sent him to do, and Saul made him a high officer in his army. That pleased everyone, including Saul's other officers.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">David had killed Goliath, the battle was over, and the Israelite army set out for home. As the army went along, women came out of each Israelite town to welcome King Saul. They were celebrating by singing songs and dancing to the music of tambourines and harps.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">They sang:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">This song made Saul very angry, and he thought, &amp;apos;They are saying that David has killed ten times more enemies than I ever did. Next they will want to make him king.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Saul never again trusted David.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">The next day the Lord let an evil spirit take control of Saul, and he began acting like a crazy man inside his house. David came to play the harp for Saul as usual, but this time Saul had a spear in his hand.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Saul thought, &amp;apos;I'll pin David to the wall.&amp;apos; He threw the spear at David twice, but David dodged and got away both times.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Saul was afraid of David, because the Lord was helping David and was no longer helping him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Saul put David in charge of 1,000 soldiers and sent him out to fight.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">The Lord helped David, and he and his soldiers always won their battles.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">This made Saul even more afraid of David.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">But everyone else in Judah and Israel was loyal to David, because he led the army in battle.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">One day, Saul told David, &amp;apos;If you'll be brave and fight the Lord 's battles for me, I'll let you marry my oldest daughter Merab.&amp;apos; But Saul was really thinking, &amp;apos;I don't want to kill David myself, so I'll let the Philistines do it for me.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">David answered, &amp;apos;How could I possibly marry your daughter? I'm not very important, and neither is my family.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">But when the time came for David to marry Saul's daughter Merab, Saul told her to marry Adriel from the town of Meholah.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Saul had another daughter. Her name was Michal, and Saul found out that she was in love with David. This made Saul happy,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">and he thought, &amp;apos;I'll tell David he can marry Michal, but I'll set it up so that the Philistines will kill him.&amp;apos; He told David, &amp;apos;I'm going to give you a second chance to marry one of my daughters.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">The officials went back to Saul and told him exactly what David had said.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">Saul was hoping that the Philistines would kill David, and he told his officials to tell David, &amp;apos;The king doesn't want any silver or gold. He only wants to get even with his enemies. All you have to do is to bring back proof that you have killed 100 Philistines!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">The officials told David, and David wanted to marry the princess.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">David and his men left and killed 200 Philistines. David brought back the proof that Saul had demanded and showed it to him, so he could marry Michal. Saul agreed to let David marry Michal.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">King Saul knew that she loved David, and he also realized that the Lord was helping David.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">But knowing those things made Saul even more afraid of David, and he was David's enemy for the rest of his life.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">The Philistine rulers kept coming to fight Israel, but whenever David fought them, he won. He was famous because he won more battles against the Philistines than any of Saul's other officers.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="19">
			<VERS vnumber="1">One day, Saul told his son Jonathan and his officers to kill David. But Jonathan and David were best friends,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Saul agreed and promised, &amp;apos;I swear by the living Lord that I won't have David killed!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Jonathan went to David and told him what Saul had said. Then he brought David to Saul, and David served in Saul's army just as he had done before.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">The next time there was a war with the Philistines, David fought hard and forced them to retreat.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Saul sent guards to watch David's house all night and then to kill him in the morning.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">She helped David leave through a window and climb down to the ground. As David ran off,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Michal put a statue in his bed. She put goat hair on its head and dressed it in some of David's clothes.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">The next morning, Saul sent guards to arrest David. But Michal told them, &amp;apos;David is sick.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Saul sent the guards back and told them, &amp;apos;Bring David to me&amp;ndash;bed and all&amp;ndash;so I can kill him.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">When the guards went in, all they found in the bed was the statue with the goat hair on its head.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">&amp;apos;Why have you tricked me this way?&amp;apos; Saul asked Michal. &amp;apos;You helped my enemy get away!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Meanwhile, David went to Samuel at Ramah and told him what Saul had done. Then Samuel and David went to Prophets Village and stayed there.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Someone told Saul, &amp;apos;David is at Prophets Village in Ramah.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Saul sent a few soldiers to bring David back. They went to Ramah and found Samuel in charge of a group of prophets who were all prophesying. Then the Spirit of God took control of the soldiers and they started prophesying too.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">When Saul heard what had happened, he sent some more soldiers, but they prophesied just like the first group. He sent a third group of soldiers, but the same thing happened to them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Finally, Saul left for Ramah himself. He went as far as the deep pit at the town of Secu, and he asked, &amp;apos;Where are Samuel and David?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">Saul left for Ramah. But as he walked along, the Spirit of God took control of him, and he started prophesying. Then, when he reached Prophets Village,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">he stripped off his clothes and prophesied in front of Samuel. He dropped to the ground and lay there naked all that day and night. That's how the saying started, &amp;apos;Is Saul now a prophet?&amp;apos;</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="20">
			<VERS vnumber="1">David escaped from Prophets Village. Then he ran to see Jonathan and asked, &amp;apos;Why does your father Saul want to kill me? What have I done wrong?&amp;apos; When they got there, I swear by the Lord God of Israel, that two days from now I'll know what my father is planning. Of course I'll let you know if he's friendly toward you. I pray that the Lord will bless you, just as he used to bless my father. Tomorrow is the New Moon Festival, and people will wonder where you are, because your place at the table will be empty. You'll know if it's safe to come out by what I tell him. If it is safe, I swear by the living Lord that I'll say, &amp;apos;The arrows are on this side of you! Pick them up!&amp;apos; During the New Moon Festival, Saul sat down to eat The boy started running, and Jonathan shot an arrow so that it would go beyond him. The boy picked up the arrows and brought them back to Jonathan, David left and Jonathan went back to town.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">&amp;apos;My father can't be trying to kill you! He never does anything without telling me about it. Why would he hide this from me? It can't be true!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">&amp;apos;Jonathan, I swear it's true! But your father knows how much you like me, and he didn't want to break your heart. That's why he didn't tell you. I swear by the living Lord and by your own life that I'm only one step ahead of death.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Then Jonathan said, &amp;apos;Tell me what to do, and I'll do it.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">David answered: Tomorrow is the New Moon Festival, and I'm supposed to eat dinner with your father. But instead, I'll hide in a field until the evening of the next day.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">If Saul wonders where I am, tell him, &amp;apos;David asked me to let him go to his hometown of Bethlehem, so he could take part in a sacrifice his family makes there every year.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">If your father says it's all right, then I'm safe. But if he gets angry, you'll know he wants to harm me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Be kind to me. After all, it was your idea to promise the Lord that we would always be loyal friends. If I've done anything wrong, kill me yourself, but don't hand me over to your father.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">&amp;apos;Don't worry,&amp;apos; Jonathan said. &amp;apos;If I find out that my father wants to kill you, I'll certainly let you know.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">&amp;apos;How will you do that?&amp;apos; David asked.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">&amp;apos;Let's go out to this field, and I'll tell you,&amp;apos; Jonathan answered.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Jonathan said:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">But if he wants to harm you, I promise to tell you and help you escape. And I ask the Lord to punish me severely if I don't keep my promise.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Jonathan and David made an agreement that even David's descendants would have to keep. Then Jonathan said, &amp;apos;I pray that the Lord will take revenge on your descendants if they break our promise.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Jonathan thought as much of David as he did of himself, so he asked David to promise once more that he would be a loyal friend.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">After this Jonathan said:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">By the day after tomorrow, everyone will think you've been gone a long time. Then go to the place where you hid before and stay beside Going-Away Rock.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">I'll shoot three arrows at a target off to the side of the rock,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">and send my servant to find the arrows.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">But if it isn't safe, I'll say to the boy, &amp;apos;The arrows are farther away!&amp;apos; This will mean that the Lord wants you to leave, and you must go.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">But he will always watch us to make sure that we keep the promise we made to each other.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">So David hid there in the field.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">by the wall, just as he always did. Jonathan sat across from him, and Abner sat next to him. But David's place was empty.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">Saul didn't say anything that day, because he was thinking, &amp;apos;Something must have happened to make David unfit to be at the Festival. Yes, something must have happened.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">The day after the New Moon Festival, when David's place was still empty, Saul asked Jonathan, &amp;apos;Why hasn't that son of Jesse come to eat with us? He wasn't here yesterday, and he still isn't here today!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">Saul was furious with Jonathan and yelled, &amp;apos;You're no son of mine, you traitor! I know you've chosen to be loyal to that son of Jesse. You should be ashamed of yourself! And your own mother should be ashamed that you were ever born.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">You'll never be safe, and your kingdom will be in danger as long as that son of Jesse is alive. Turn him over to me now! He deserves to die!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">&amp;apos;Why do you want to kill David?&amp;apos; Jonathan asked. &amp;apos;What has he done?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">Saul threw his spear at Jonathan and tried to kill him. Then Jonathan was sure that his father really did want to kill David.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">Jonathan was angry and hurt that his father had insulted David so terribly. He got up, left the table, and didn't eat anything all that day.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">In the morning, Jonathan went out to the field to meet David. He took a servant boy along</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">and told him, &amp;apos;When I shoot the arrows, you run and find them for me.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">When the boy got near the place where the arrow had landed, Jonathan shouted, &amp;apos;Isn't the arrow on past you?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">Jonathan shouted to him again, &amp;apos;Hurry up! Don't stop!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">but he had no idea about what was going on. Only Jonathan and David knew.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">Jonathan gave his weapons to the boy and told him, &amp;apos;Take these back into town.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">After the boy had gone, David got up from beside the mound and bowed very low three times. Then he and Jonathan kissed each other and cried, but David cried louder.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">Jonathan said, &amp;apos;Take care of yourself. And remember, we each have asked the Lord to watch and make sure that we and our descendants keep our promise forever.&amp;apos;</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="21">
			<VERS vnumber="1">David went to see Ahimelech, a priest who lived in the town of Nob. Ahimelech was trembling with fear as he came out to meet David. &amp;apos;Why are you alone?&amp;apos; Ahimelech asked. &amp;apos;Why isn't anyone else with you?&amp;apos; &amp;apos;It's the best sword there is,&amp;apos; David said. &amp;apos;I'll take it!&amp;apos; &amp;quot;Saul has killed a thousand enemies; David has killed ten thousand&amp;quot;?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">&amp;apos;I'm on a mission for King Saul,&amp;apos; David answered. &amp;apos;He ordered me not to tell anyone what the mission is all about, so I ordered my soldiers to stay somewhere else.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Do you have any food you can give me? Could you spare five loaves of bread?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">&amp;apos;The only bread I have is the sacred bread,&amp;apos; the priest told David. &amp;apos;You can have it if your soldiers didn't sleep with women last night.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">&amp;apos;Of course we didn't sleep with women,&amp;apos; David answered. &amp;apos;I never let my men do that when we're on a mission. They have to be acceptable to worship God even when we're on a regular mission, and today we're on a special mission.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">The only bread the priest had was the sacred bread that he had taken from the place of worship after putting out the fresh loaves. So he gave it to David.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">It so happened that one of Saul's officers was there, worshiping the Lord that day. His name was Doeg the Edomite, and he was the strongest of Saul's shepherds.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">David asked Ahimelech, &amp;apos;Do you have a spear or a sword? I had to leave so quickly on this mission for the king that I didn't bring along my sword or any other weapons.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">The priest answered, &amp;apos;The only sword here is the one that belonged to Goliath the Philistine. You were the one who killed him in Elah Valley, and so you can take his sword if you want to. It's wrapped in a cloth behind the statue.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">David kept on running from Saul that day until he came to Gath, where he met with King Achish.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">The officers of King Achish were also there, and they asked Achish, &amp;apos;Isn't David a king back in his own country? Don't the Israelites dance and sing,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">David thought about what they were saying, and it made him afraid of Achish.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">So right there in front of everyone, he pretended to be insane. He acted confused and started making scratches on the doors of the town gate, while drooling in his beard.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">&amp;apos;Look at him!&amp;apos; Achish said to his officers. &amp;apos;You can see he's crazy. Why did you bring him to me?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">I have enough crazy people without your bringing another one here. Keep him away from my palace!&amp;apos;</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1">When David escaped from the town of Gath, he went to Adullam Cave. His brothers and the rest of his family found out where he was, and they followed him there.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">A lot of other people joined him too. Some were in trouble, others were angry or in debt, and David was soon the leader of 400 men. &amp;apos;Certainly, Your Majesty,&amp;apos; Ahimelech answered. But the king's officers would not attack the priests of the Lord . On that same day, Doeg killed 85 priests.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">David left Adullam Cave and went to the town of Mizpeh in Moab, where he talked with the king of Moab. &amp;apos;Please,&amp;apos; David said, &amp;apos;let my father and mother stay with you until I find out what God will do with me.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">So he brought his parents to the king of Moab, and they stayed with him while David was in hiding.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">One day the prophet Gad told David, &amp;apos;Don't stay here! Go back to Judah.&amp;apos; David then left and went to Hereth Forest.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Saul was sitting under a small tree on top of the hill at Gibeah when he heard that David and his men had been located. Saul was holding his spear, and his officers were standing in front of him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">He told them: Listen to me! You belong to the Benjamin tribe, so if that son of Jesse ever becomes king, he won't give you fields or vineyards. He won't make you officers in charge of thousands or hundreds as I have done.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">But you're all plotting against me! Not one of you told me that my own son Jonathan had made an agreement with him. Not one of you cared enough to tell me that Jonathan had helped one of my officers rebel. Now that son of Jesse is trying to ambush me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Doeg the Edomite was standing with the other officers and spoke up, &amp;apos;When I was in the town of Nob, I saw that son of Jesse. He was visiting the priest Ahimelech the son of Ahitub.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Ahimelech talked to the Lord for him, then gave him food and the sword that had belonged to Goliath the Philistine.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Saul sent a message to Ahimelech and his whole family of priests at Nob, ordering them to come to him. When they came,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Saul told them, &amp;apos;Listen to me, you son of Ahitub.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Saul demanded, &amp;apos;Why did you plot against me with that son of Jesse? You helped him rebel against me by giving him food and a sword, and by talking with God for him. Now he's trying to ambush me!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">&amp;apos;Your Majesty, none of your officers is more loyal than David!&amp;apos; Ahimelech replied. &amp;apos;He's your son-in-law and the captain of your bodyguard. Everyone in your family respects him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">This isn't the first time I've talked with God for David, and it's never made you angry before! Please don't accuse me or my family like this. I have no idea what's going on!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">&amp;apos;Ahimelech,&amp;apos; Saul said, &amp;apos;you and your whole family are going to die.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Saul shouted to his bodyguards, &amp;apos;These priests of the Lord helped David! They knew he was running away, but they didn't tell me. Kill them!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Saul turned to Doeg, who was from Edom, and said, &amp;apos;Kill the priests!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Then he attacked the town of Nob, where the priests had lived, and he killed everyone there&amp;ndash;men, women, children, and babies. He even killed their cattle, donkeys, and sheep.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Ahimelech's son Abiathar was the only one who escaped. He ran to David</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">and told him, &amp;apos;Saul has murdered the Lord 's priests at Nob!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">David answered, &amp;apos;That day when I saw Doeg, I knew he would tell Saul! Your family died because of me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">Stay here. Isn't the same person trying to kill both of us? Don't worry! You'll be safe here with me.&amp;apos;</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="23">
			<VERS vnumber="1">One day some people told David, &amp;apos;The Philistines keep attacking the town of Keilah and stealing grain from the threshing place.&amp;apos; &amp;apos;Yes,&amp;apos; the Lord answered. &amp;apos;Attack them and rescue Keilah.&amp;apos; By this time, Abiathar had joined David in Keilah and had brought along everything he needed to get answers from God. &amp;apos;Yes, he will come,&amp;apos; the Lord answered. &amp;apos;Yes, they would,&amp;apos; the Lord answered. You've done me a big favor, and I pray that the Lord will bless you. Saul found out where David was and started closing in on him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">David asked the Lord , &amp;apos;Should I attack these Philistines?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">But David's men said, &amp;apos;Look, even here in Judah we're afraid of the Philistines. We will be terrified if we try to fight them at Keilah!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">David asked the Lord about it again. &amp;apos;Leave at once,&amp;apos; the Lord answered. &amp;apos;I will give you victory over the Philistines at Keilah.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">David and his men went there and fiercely attacked the Philistines. They killed many of them, then led away their cattle, and rescued the people of Keilah.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">David heard about Saul's plan to capture him, and he told Abiathar, &amp;apos;Let's ask God what we should do.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">David prayed, &amp;apos; Lord God of Israel, I was told that Saul is planning to come here. What should I do? Suppose he threatens to destroy the town because of me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Would the leaders of Keilah turn me over to Saul? Or is he really coming? Please tell me, Lord .&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">David asked, &amp;apos;Would the leaders of Keilah hand me and my soldiers over to Saul?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">David and his 600 men got out of there fast and started moving from place to place. Saul heard that David had left Keilah, and he decided not to go after him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">David stayed in hideouts in the hill country of Ziph Desert. Saul kept searching, but God never let Saul catch him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">One time, David was at Horesh in Ziph Desert. He was afraid because Saul had come to the area to kill him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">But Jonathan went to see David, and God helped him encourage David.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">&amp;apos;Don't be afraid,&amp;apos; Jonathan said. &amp;apos;My father Saul will never get his hands on you. In fact, you're going to be the next king of Israel, and I'll be your highest official. Even my father knows it's true.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">They both promised the Lord that they would always be loyal to each other. Then Jonathan went home, but David stayed at Horesh.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Some people from the town of Ziph went to Saul at Gibeah and said, &amp;apos;Your Majesty, David has a hideout not far from us! It's near Horesh, somewhere on Mount Hachilah south of Jeshimon.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">If you come, we will help you catch him.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Saul told them:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Now please do just a little more for me. Find out exactly where David is, as well as where he goes, and who has seen him there. I've been told that he's very tricky.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">Find out where all his hiding places are and come back when you're sure. Then I'll go with you. If he is still in the area, or anywhere among the clans of Judah, I'll find him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">The people from Ziph went back ahead of Saul, and they found out that David and his men were still south of Jeshimon in the Maon Desert.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">Saul and his army set out to find David. But David heard that Saul was coming, and he went to a place called The Rock, one of his hideouts in Maon Desert.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">Saul was going around a hill on one side, and David and his men were on the other side, trying to get away. Saul and his soldiers were just about to capture David and his men,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">when a messenger came to Saul and said, &amp;apos;Come quickly! The Philistines are attacking Israel and taking everything.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">Saul stopped going after David and went back to fight the Philistines. That's why the place is called &amp;apos;Escape Rock.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">David left and went to live in the hideouts at En-Gedi.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="24">
			<VERS vnumber="1">When Saul got back from fighting off the Philistines, he heard that David was in the desert around En-Gedi.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Saul led 3,000 of Israel's best soldiers out to look for David and his men near Wild Goat Rocks at En-Gedi.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">There were some sheep pens along the side of the road, and one of them was built around the entrance to a cave. Saul went into the cave to relieve himself. David and his men were hiding at the back of the cave. Saul left the cave and started down the road. Saul turned around to look. David bowed down very low Your Majesty, why do you listen to people who say that I'm trying to harm you? David, you're a better person than I am. You treated me with kindness, even though I've been cruel to you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">They whispered to David, &amp;apos;The Lord told you he was going to let you defeat your enemies and do whatever you want with them. This must be the day the Lord was talking about.&amp;apos; David sneaked over and cut off a small piece of Saul's robe, but Saul didn't notice a thing.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Afterwards, David was sorry that he had even done that,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Soon, David also got up and left the cave. &amp;apos;Your Majesty!&amp;apos; he shouted from a distance.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">and said:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">You can see for yourself that the Lord gave me the chance to catch you in the cave today. Some of my men wanted to kill you, but I wouldn't let them do it. I told them, &amp;apos;I will not harm the Lord 's chosen king!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Your Majesty, look at what I'm holding. You can see that it's a piece of your robe. If I could cut off a piece of your robe, I could have killed you. But I let you live, and that should prove I'm not trying to harm you or to rebel. I haven't done anything to you, and yet you keep trying to ambush and kill me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">I'll let the Lord decide which one of us has done right. I pray that the Lord will punish you for what you're doing to me, but I won't do anything to you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">An old proverb says, &amp;apos;Only evil people do evil things,&amp;apos; and so I won't harm you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Why should the king of Israel be out chasing me, anyway? I'm as worthless as a dead dog or a flea.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">I pray that the Lord will help me escape and show that I am in the right.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">&amp;apos;David, my son&amp;ndash;is that you?&amp;apos; Saul asked. Then he started crying</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">and said:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">You've told me how you were kind enough not to kill me when the Lord gave you the chance.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">If you really were my enemy, you wouldn't have let me leave here alive. I pray that the Lord will give you a big reward for what you did today.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">I realize now that you will be the next king, and a powerful king at that.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Promise me with the Lord as your witness, that you won't wipe out my descendants. Let them live to keep my family name alive.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">So David promised, and Saul went home. David and his men returned to their hideout.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="25">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Samuel died, and people from all over Israel gathered to mourn for him when he was buried at his home in Ramah. Meanwhile, David moved his camp to Paran Desert. I hope that you and your family are healthy and that all is going well for you. When your shepherds were with us in Carmel, we didn't harm them, and nothing was ever stolen from them. Who does this David think he is? That son of Jesse is just one more slave on the run from his master, and there are too many of them these days. They all strapped on their swords. Two hundred men stayed behind to guard the camp, but the other 400 followed David. David's men were often nearby while we were taking care of the sheep in the fields. They were very good to us, they never hurt us, and nothing was ever stolen from us while they were nearby. With them around day or night, we were as safe as we would have been inside a walled city. David sent some messengers from the desert to wish our master well, but he shouted insults at them. Isn't there something you can do? Please think of something! Or else our master and his family and everyone who works for him are all doomed. Sir, please let me explain! I didn't see the men you sent, When the Lord does all those good things for you, please remember me. I praise the Lord God of Israel! He must have sent you to meet me today. Abigail was still at Carmel. So David sent messengers to ask her if she would marry him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">One day, Nabal was in Carmel where his servants were cutting the wool from his sheep. David was in the desert when he heard about it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">I've heard that you are cutting the wool from your sheep.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Ask your shepherds, and they'll tell you the same thing. My servants are your servants, and you are like a father to me. This is a day for celebrating, so please be kind and share some of your food with us.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">David's men went to Nabal and gave him David's message, then they waited for Nabal's answer.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">This is what he said:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">What makes you think I would take my bread, my water, and the meat that I've had cooked for my own servants and give it to you? Besides, I'm not sure that David sent you!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">The men returned to their camp and told David everything Nabal had said.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">&amp;apos;Everybody get your swords!&amp;apos; David ordered.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">He's a bully who won't listen to anyone.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Abigail quickly got together 200 loaves of bread, two large clay jars of wine, the meat from five sheep, a large sack of roasted grain, 100 handfuls of raisins, and 200 handfuls of dried figs. She loaded all the food on donkeys</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">and told her servants, &amp;apos;Take this on ahead, and I'll catch up with you.&amp;apos; She didn't tell her husband Nabal what she was doing.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Abigail was riding her donkey on the path that led around the hillside, when suddenly she met David and his men heading straight at her.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">David had just been saying, &amp;apos;I surely wasted my time guarding Nabal's things in the desert and keeping them from being stolen! I was good to him, and now he pays me back with insults.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">I swear that by morning, there won't be a man or boy left from his family or his servants' families. I pray that God will punish me if I don't do it!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">Abigail quickly got off her donkey and bowed down in front of David.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">Then she said:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">Don't pay any attention to that good-for-nothing Nabal. His name means &amp;apos;fool,&amp;apos; and it really fits him!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">Please forgive me if I say a little more. The Lord will always protect you and your family, because you fight for him. I pray that you won't ever do anything evil as long as you live.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">The Lord your God will keep you safe when your enemies try to kill you. But he will snatch away their lives quicker than you can throw a rock from a sling.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">The Lord has promised to do many good things for you, even to make you the ruler of Israel. The Lord will keep his promises to you,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">and now your conscience will be clear, because you won't be guilty of taking revenge and killing innocent people.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">David told her:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">And you should also be praised. Your good sense kept me from taking revenge and killing innocent people.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">If you hadn't come to meet me so quickly, every man and boy in Nabal's family and in his servants' families would have been killed by morning. I swear by the living Lord God of Israel who protected you that this is the truth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">David accepted the food Abigail had brought. &amp;apos;Don't worry,&amp;apos; he said. &amp;apos;You can go home now. I'll do what you asked.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">Abigail went back home and found Nabal throwing a party fit for a king. He was very drunk and feeling good, so she didn't tell him anything that night.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">But when he sobered up the next morning, Abigail told him everything that had happened. Nabal had a heart attack, and he lay in bed as still as a stone.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">Ten days later, the Lord took his life.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">She bowed down and said, &amp;apos;I would willingly be David's slave and wash his servants' feet.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">Abigail quickly got ready and went back with David's messengers. She rode on her donkey, while five of her servant women walked alongside. She and David were married as soon as she arrived.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43">David had earlier married Ahinoam from the town of Jezreel, so both she and Abigail were now David's wives.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44">Meanwhile, Saul had arranged for Michal to marry Palti the son of Laish, who came from the town of Gallim.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="26">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Once again, some people from Ziph went to Gibeah to talk with Saul. &amp;apos;David has a hideout on Mount Hachilah near Jeshimon out in the desert,&amp;apos; they told him. When David heard that Saul was following him, &amp;apos;I will!&amp;apos; Abishai answered. Abner shouted back. &amp;apos;Who dares disturb the king?&amp;apos; &amp;apos;Yes it is, Your Majesty. Saul went back home. David also left,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Saul took 3,000 of Israel's best soldiers and went to look for David there in Ziph Desert.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Saul set up camp on Mount Hachilah, which is across the road from Jeshimon. But David was hiding out in the desert.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">he sent some spies to find out if it was true.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Then he sneaked up to Saul's camp. He noticed that Saul and his army commander Abner the son of Ner were sleeping in the middle of the camp, with soldiers sleeping all around them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">David asked Ahimelech the Hittite and Joab's brother Abishai, &amp;apos;Which one of you will go with me into Saul's camp?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">That same night, David and Abishai crept into the camp. Saul was sleeping, and his spear was stuck in the ground not far from his head. Abner and the soldiers were sound asleep all around him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Abishai whispered, &amp;apos;This time God has let you get your hands on your enemy! I'll pin him to the ground with one thrust of his own spear.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">&amp;apos;Don't kill him!&amp;apos; David whispered back. &amp;apos;The Lord will punish anyone who kills his chosen king.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">As surely as the Lord lives, the Lord will kill Saul, or Saul will die a natural death or be killed in battle.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">But I pray that the Lord will keep me from harming his chosen king. Let's grab his spear and his water jar and get out of here!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">David took the spear and the water jar, then left the camp. None of Saul's soldiers knew what had happened or even woke up&amp;ndash;the Lord had made all of them fall sound asleep.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">David and Abishai crossed the valley and went to the top of the next hill, where they were at a safe distance.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">&amp;apos;Abner!&amp;apos; David shouted toward Saul's army. &amp;apos;Can you hear me?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">&amp;apos;Abner, what kind of a man are you?&amp;apos; David replied. &amp;apos;Aren't you supposed to be the best soldier in Israel? Then why didn't you protect your king? Anyone who went into your camp could have killed him tonight.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">You're a complete failure! I swear by the living Lord that you and your men deserve to die for not protecting the Lord 's chosen king. Look and see if you can find the king's spear and the water jar that were near his head.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Saul could tell it was David's voice, and he called out, &amp;apos;David, my son! Is that you?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Why are you hunting me down? Have I done something wrong, or have I committed a crime?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Please listen to what I have to say. If the Lord has turned you against me, maybe a sacrifice will make him change his mind. But if some people have turned you against me, I hope the Lord will punish them! They have forced me to leave the land that belongs to the Lord and have told me to worship foreign gods.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Don't let me die in a land far away from the Lord . I'm no more important than a flea! Why should the king of Israel hunt me down as if I were a bird in the mountains?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">&amp;apos;David, you had the chance to kill me today. But you didn't. I was very wrong about you. It was a terrible mistake for me to try to kill you. I've acted like a fool, but I'll never try to harm you again. You're like a son to me, so please come back.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">&amp;apos;Your Majesty, here's your spear! Let one of your soldiers come and get it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">The Lord put you in my power today, but you are his chosen king and I wouldn't harm you. The Lord rewards people who are faithful and live right.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">I spared your life today, and I pray that the Lord will spare my life and keep me safe.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">&amp;apos;David, my son, I pray that the Lord will bless you and make you successful!&amp;apos;</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="27">
			<VERS vnumber="1">but he thought to himself, &amp;apos;One of these days, Saul is going to kill me. The only way to escape from him is to go to Philistia. Then I'll be outside of Israel, and Saul will give up trying to catch me.&amp;apos; After he returned from a raid, David always went to see Achish, David made these raids all the time he was in Philistia.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">When Saul found out that David had run off to Gath, he stopped trying to catch him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">One day, David was talking with Achish and said, &amp;apos;If you are happy with me, then let me live in one of the towns in the countryside. I'm not important enough to live here with you in the royal city.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Achish gave David the town of Ziklag that same day, and Ziklag has belonged to the kings of Judah ever since.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">David was in Philistia for a year and four months.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">The Geshurites, the Girzites, and the Amalekites lived in the area from Telam to Shur and on as far as Egypt, and David often attacked their towns.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Whenever David and his men attacked a town, they took the sheep, cattle, donkeys, camels, and the clothing, and killed everyone who lived there.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">who would ask, &amp;apos;Where did you attack today?&amp;apos; David would answer, &amp;apos;Oh, we attacked some desert town that belonged to the Judah tribe.&amp;apos; Sometimes David would say, &amp;apos;Oh, we attacked a town in the desert where the Jerahmeel clan lives&amp;apos; or &amp;apos;We attacked a town in the desert where the Kenites live.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">That's why David killed everyone in the towns he attacked. He thought, &amp;apos;If I let any of them live, they might come to Gath and tell what I've really been doing.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">But Achish trusted David and thought, &amp;apos;David's people must be furious with him. From now on he will have to take orders from me.&amp;apos;</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="4">The Philistines went to Shunem and set up camp. Saul called the army of Israel together, and they set up their camp in Gilboa.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Saul took one look at the Philistine army and started shaking with fear.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">So he asked the Lord what to do. But the Lord would not answer, either in a dream or by a priest or a prophet.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Then Saul told his officers, &amp;apos;Find me a woman who can talk to the spirits of the dead. I'll go to her and find out what's going to happen.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">That night, Saul put on different clothing so nobody would recognize him. Then he and two of his men went to the woman, and asked, &amp;apos;Will you bring up the ghost of someone for us?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">The woman said, &amp;apos;Why are you trying to trick me and get me killed? You know King Saul has killed everyone who talks to the spirits of the dead!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Saul replied, &amp;apos;I swear by the living Lord that nothing will happen to you because of this.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">&amp;apos;Who do you want me to bring up?&amp;apos; she asked.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">When the woman saw Samuel, she screamed. Then she turned to Saul and said, &amp;apos;You've tricked me! You're the king!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">&amp;apos;Don't be afraid,&amp;apos; Saul replied. &amp;apos;Just tell me what you see.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">&amp;apos;What does it look like?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">&amp;apos;Why are you bothering me by bringing me up like this?&amp;apos; Samuel asked.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Samuel said:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">I've already told you: The Lord has sworn to take the kingdom from you and give it to David. And that's just what he's doing!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">When the Lord was angry with the Amalekites, he told you to destroy them, but you didn't do it. That's why the Lord is doing this to you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Tomorrow the Lord will let the Philistines defeat Israel's army, then you and your sons will join me down here in the world of the dead.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">At once, Saul collapsed and lay stretched out on the floor, terrified at what Samuel had said. He was weak because he had not eaten anything since the day before.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">The woman came over to Saul, and when she saw that he was completely terrified, she said, &amp;apos;Your Majesty, I listened to you and risked my life to do what you asked.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1">It took David and his men three days to reach Ziklag. But while they had been away, the Amalekites had been raiding in the desert around there. They had attacked Ziklag, burned it to the ground,</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="3">When David and his men came to Ziklag, they saw the burned-out ruins and learned that their families had been taken captive.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">They started crying and kept it up until they were too weak to cry any more.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">David's two wives, Ahinoam and Abigail, had been taken captive with everyone else. Abiathar brought everything he needed to get answers from God, and he went over to David. &amp;apos;Go after them,&amp;apos; the Lord answered. &amp;apos;You will catch up with them, and you will rescue your families.&amp;apos; &amp;apos;I'm from Egypt,&amp;apos; the young man answered. &amp;apos;I'm the servant of an Amalekite, but he left me here three days ago because I was sick. &amp;apos;Yes, I will, if you promise with God as a witness that you won't kill me or hand me over to my master.&amp;apos; David also took the sheep and cattle that the Amalekites had with them, but he kept these separate from the others. Everyone agreed that these would be David's reward. My friends, don't be so greedy with what the Lord has given us! The Lord protected us and gave us victory over the people who attacked.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">David was desperate. His soldiers were so upset over what had happened to their sons and daughters that they were thinking about stoning David to death. But he felt the Lord God giving him strength,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">and he said to the priest, &amp;apos;Abiathar, let's ask God what to do.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Then David asked the Lord , &amp;apos;Should I go after the people who raided our town? Can I catch up with them?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Some of David's men found an Egyptian out in a field and took him to David. They gave the Egyptian some bread, and he ate it. Then they gave him a drink of water,</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="14">We had attacked some towns in the desert where the Cherethites live, in the area that belongs to Judah, and in the desert where the Caleb clan lives. And we burned down Ziklag.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">&amp;apos;Will you take me to those Amalekites?&amp;apos; David asked.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">He led David to the Amalekites. They were eating and drinking everywhere, celebrating because of what they had taken from Philistia and Judah.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">David attacked just before sunrise the next day and fought until sunset. Four hundred Amalekites rode away on camels, but they were the only ones who escaped.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="21">On the way back, David went to the 200 men he had left at Besor Gorge, because they had been too tired to keep up with him. They came toward David and the people who were with him. When David was close enough, he greeted the 200 men and asked how they were doing.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Some of David's men were good-for-nothings, and they said, &amp;apos;Those men didn't go with us to the battle, so they don't get any of the things we took back from the Amalekites. Let them take their wives and children and go!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">But David said:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">Who would pay attention to you, anyway? Soldiers who stay behind to guard the camp get as much as those who go into battle.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">David made this a law for Israel, and it has been the same ever since.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">David went back to Ziklag with everything they had taken from the Amalekites. He sent some of these things as gifts to his friends who were leaders of Judah, and he told them, &amp;apos;We took these things from the Lord 's enemies. Please accept them as a gift.&amp;apos;</VERS>

The Lord bless you! You were kind enough to bury Saul your ruler, Joab agreed, Asahel answered, &amp;apos;Yes it is.&amp;apos; But Asahel refused to stop.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">David went to Hebron with his two wives, Ahinoam and Abigail. Ahinoam was from Jezreel, and Abigail was the widow of Nabal from Carmel.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">David also told his men and their families to come and live in the villages near Hebron.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">The people of Judah met with David at Hebron and poured olive oil on his head to show that he was their new king. Then they told David, &amp;apos;The people from Jabesh in Gilead buried Saul.&amp;apos;</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="7">Saul is dead, but the tribe of Judah has made me their king. So be strong and have courage.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Abner the son of Ner had been the general of Saul's army. He took Saul's son Ishbosheth across the Jordan River to Mahanaim</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="10">Ishbosheth was 40 years old at the time, and he ruled for two years. But the tribe of Judah made David their king,</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="12">One day, Abner and the soldiers of Ishbosheth left Mahanaim and went to Gibeon.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Meanwhile, Joab the son of Zeruiah was leading David's soldiers, and the two groups met at the pool in Gibeon. Abner and his men sat down on one side of the pool, while Joab and his men sat on the other side.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Abner yelled to Joab, &amp;apos;Let's get some of our best soldiers to stand up and fight each other!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">and twelve of Ishbosheth's men from the tribe of Benjamin got up to fight twelve of David's men.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">They grabbed each other by the hair and stabbed each other in the side with their daggers. They all died right there! That's why the place in Gibeon is called &amp;apos;Field of Daggers.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Then everyone started fighting. Both sides fought very hard, but David's soldiers defeated Abner and the soldiers of Israel.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Zeruiah's three sons were there: Joab, Abishai, and Asahel. Asahel could run as fast as a deer in an open field,</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="20">When Abner turned and saw him, he said, &amp;apos;Is that you, Asahel?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Abner said, &amp;apos;There are soldiers all around. Stop chasing me and fight one of them! Kill him and take his clothes and weapons for yourself.&amp;apos;</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="23">But Asahel would not turn back, so Abner struck him in the stomach with the back end of his spear. The spear went all the way through and came out of his back. Asahel fell down and died. Everyone who saw Asahel lying dead just stopped and stood still.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">But Joab and Abishai went after Abner. Finally, about sunset, they came to the hill of Ammah, not far from Giah on the road to Gibeon Desert.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">Abner brought the men of Benjamin together in one group on top of a hill, and they got ready to fight.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">Abner shouted to Joab, &amp;apos;Aren't we ever going to stop killing each other? Don't you know that the longer we keep on doing this, the worse it's going to be when it's all over? When are you going to order your men to stop chasing their own relatives?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">Joab shouted back, &amp;apos;I swear by the living God, if you hadn't spoken, my men would have chased their relatives all night!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">Joab took his trumpet and blew the signal for his soldiers to stop chasing the soldiers of Israel. At once, the fighting stopped.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">Abner and his troops marched through the Jordan River valley all that night. Then they crossed the river and marched all morning until they arrived back at Mahanaim.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">As soon as Joab stopped chasing Abner, he got David's troops together and counted them. There were 19 missing besides Asahel.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">But David's soldiers had killed 360 of Abner's men from the tribe of Benjamin.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">Joab and his troops carried Asahel's body to Bethlehem and buried him in the family burial place. Then they marched all night and reached Hebron before sunrise.</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="3">
			<VERS vnumber="1">This battle was the beginning of a long war between the followers of Saul and the followers of David. Saul's power grew weaker, but David's grew stronger. Am I some kind of worthless dog from Judah? I've always been loyal to your father's family and to his relatives and friends. I haven't turned you over to David. And yet you talk to me as if I've committed a crime with this woman. David told Abner he could leave, and he left without causing any trouble. David walked behind the stretcher on which Abner's body was being carried. Abner, why should you or chained your feet, yet you died as a victim of murderers. Everyone started crying again.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">As the war went on between the families of David and Saul, Abner was gaining more power than ever in Saul's family.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">He had even slept with a wife of Saul by the name of Rizpah the daughter of Aiah. But Saul's son Ishbosheth told Abner, &amp;apos;You shouldn't have slept with one of my father's wives!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Abner was very angry because of what Ishbosheth had said, and he told Ishbosheth:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">I ask God to punish me if I don't help David get what the Lord promised him!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">God said that he wouldn't let anyone in Saul's family ever be king again and that David would be king instead. He also said that David would rule both Israel and Judah, all the way from Dan in the north to Beersheba in the south.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Ishbosheth was so afraid of Abner that he could not even answer.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Abner sent some of his men to David with this message: &amp;apos;You should be the ruler of the whole nation. If you make an agreement with me, I will persuade everyone in Israel to make you their king.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">David sent this message back: &amp;apos;Good! I'll make an agreement with you. But before I will even talk with you about it, you must get Saul's daughter Michal back for me.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">David sent a few of his officials to Ishbosheth to give him this message: &amp;apos;Give me back my wife Michal! I killed 100 Philistines so I could marry her.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Ishbosheth sent some of his men to take Michal away from her new husband, Paltiel the son of Laish.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Paltiel followed Michal and the men all the way to Bahurim, crying as he walked. But he went back home after Abner ordered him to leave.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Abner talked with the leaders of the tribes of Israel and told them, &amp;apos;You've wanted to make David your king for a long time now.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">So do it! After all, God said he would use his servant David to rescue his people Israel from their enemies, especially from the Philistines.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Finally, Abner talked with the tribe of Benjamin. Then he left for Hebron to tell David everything that the tribe of Benjamin and the rest of the people of Israel wanted to do.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Abner took 20 soldiers with him, and when they got to Hebron, David gave a big feast for them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">After the feast, Abner said, &amp;apos;Your Majesty, let me leave now and bring Israel here to make an agreement with you. You'll be king of the whole nation, just as you've been wanting.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Soon after Abner had left Hebron, Joab and some of David's soldiers came back, bringing a lot of things they had taken from an enemy village.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">Right after they arrived, someone told Joab, &amp;apos;Abner visited the king, and the king let him go. Abner even left without causing any trouble.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">Joab went to David and said, &amp;apos;What have you done? Abner came to you, and you let him go. Now he's long gone!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">You know Abner&amp;ndash;he came to trick you. He wants to find out how strong your army is and to know everything you're doing.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">Joab left David, then he sent some messengers to catch up with Abner. They brought him back from the well at Sirah, but David did not know anything about it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">When Abner returned to Hebron, Joab pretended he wanted to talk privately with him. So he took Abner into one of the small rooms that were part of the town gate and stabbed him in the stomach. Joab killed him because Abner had killed Joab's brother Asahel.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">David heard how Joab had killed Abner, and he said, &amp;apos;I swear to the Lord that I am completely innocent of Abner's death!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">Joab and his family are the guilty ones. I pray that Joab's family will always be sick with sores and other skin diseases. May they all be cowards, and may they die in war or starve to death.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">Joab and his brother Abishai killed Abner because he had killed their brother Asahel in the battle at Gibeon.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">David told Joab and everyone with him, &amp;apos;Show your sorrow by tearing your clothes and wearing sackcloth! Walk in front of Abner's body and cry!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">Abner was buried in Hebron, while David and everyone else stood at the tomb and cried loudly.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">Then the king sang a funeral song about Abner: have died like an outlaw?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">No one tied your hands</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">Then they brought some food to David and told him he would feel better if he had something to eat. It was still daytime, and David said, &amp;apos;I swear to God that I won't take a bite of bread or anything else until sunset!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">Everyone noticed what David did, and they liked it, just as they always liked what he did.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">Now the people of Judah and Israel were certain that David had nothing to do with killing Abner.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">David said to his officials, &amp;apos;Don't you realize that today one of Israel's great leaders has died?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">I am the chosen king, but Joab and Abishai have more power than I do. So God will have to pay them back for the evil thing they did.&amp;apos;</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="4">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Ishbosheth felt like giving up after he heard that Abner had died in Hebron. Everyone in Israel was terrified. Rechab and Baanah walked through the Jordan River valley all night long. I swear that only the Lord rescues me when I'm in trouble!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Ishbosheth had put the two brothers Baanah and Rechab in charge of the soldiers who raided enemy villages. Rimmon was their father, and they were from the town of Beeroth, which belonged to the tribe of Benjamin.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">The people who used to live in Beeroth had run away to Gittaim, and they still live there.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Saul's son Jonathan had a son named Mephibosheth, who had not been able to walk since he was five years old. It happened when someone from Jezreel told his nurse that Saul and Jonathan had died. She hurried off with the boy in her arms, but he fell and injured his legs.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">One day about noon, Rechab and Baanah went to Ishbosheth's house. It was a hot day, and he was resting</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Finally they turned west and went to Hebron. They went in to see David and told him, &amp;apos;Your Majesty, here is the head of Ishbosheth, the son of your enemy Saul who tried to kill you! The Lord has let you get even with Saul and his family.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">David answered:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">When a man came to Ziklag and told me that Saul was dead, he thought he deserved a reward for bringing good news. But I grabbed him and killed him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">You evil men have done something much worse than he did. You've killed an innocent man in his own house and on his own bed. I'll make you pay for that. I'll wipe you from the face of the earth!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Then David said to his troops, &amp;apos;Kill these two brothers! Cut off their hands and feet and hang their bodies by the pool in Hebron. But bury Ishbosheth's head in Abner's tomb near Hebron.&amp;apos; And they did.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1">David brought together 30,000 of Israel's best soldiers and</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">led them to Baalah in Judah, which was also called Kiriath-Jearim. They were going there to get the sacred chest and bring it back to Jerusalem. The throne of the Lord All-Powerful is above the winged creatures on top of this chest, and he is worshiped there. At once, David went to Obed Edom's house to get the chest and bring it to David's City. Everyone was celebrating.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">They put the sacred chest on a new ox cart and started bringing it down the hill from Abinadab's house. Abinadab's sons Uzzah and Ahio were guiding the ox cart,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">with Ahio walking in front of it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Some of the people of Israel were playing music on small harps and other stringed instruments, and on tambourines, castanets, and cymbals. David and the others were happy, and they danced for the Lord with all their might.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">But when they came to Nacon's threshing-floor, the oxen stumbled, so Uzzah reached out and took hold of the sacred chest.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">The Lord God was very angry with Uzzah for doing this, and he killed Uzzah right there beside the chest.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">David got angry with God for killing Uzzah. He named that place &amp;apos;Bursting Out Against Uzzah,&amp;apos; and that's what it's still called.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">David was afraid of the Lord and thought, &amp;apos;Should I really take the sacred chest to my city?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">He decided not to take it there. Instead, he turned off the road and took it to the home of Obed Edom, who was from Gath.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">The people carrying the chest walked six steps, then David sacrificed an ox and a choice cow.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">He was dancing for the Lord with all his might, but he wore only a linen cloth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">He and everyone else were celebrating by shouting and blowing horns while the chest was being carried along.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="17">They put the chest inside a tent that David had set up for it. David worshiped the Lord by sacrificing animals and burning them on an altar,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">then he blessed the people in the name of the Lord All-Powerful.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">He gave all the men and women in the crowd a small loaf of bread, some meat, and a handful of raisins, then everyone went home.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">David went home so he could ask the Lord to bless his family. But Saul's daughter Michal went out and started yelling at him. &amp;apos;You were really great today!&amp;apos; she said. &amp;apos;You acted like a dirty old man, dancing around half-naked in front of your servants' slave-girls.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">David told her, &amp;apos;The Lord didn't choose your father or anyone else in your family to be the leader of his people. The Lord chose me, and I was celebrating in honor of him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">I'll show you just how great I can be! I'll even be disgusting to myself. But those slave-girls you talked about will still honor me!&amp;apos;</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1">King David moved into his new palace, and the Lord let his kingdom be at peace.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Then one day, as David was talking with Nathan the prophet, David said, &amp;apos;Look around! I live in a palace made of cedar, but the sacred chest has to stay in a tent.&amp;apos; David, you are my servant, so listen to what I say. Why should you build a temple for me? Now I promise that you and your descendants will be kings. When he does wrong, I'll see that he is corrected, just as children are corrected by their parents. Lord All-Powerful, my family and I don't deserve what you have already done for us,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Nathan replied, &amp;apos;The Lord is with you, so do what you want!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">That night, the Lord told Nathan</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">to go to David and give him this message:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">I didn't live in a temple when I brought my people out of Egypt, and I don't live in one now. A tent has always been my home wherever I have gone with them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">I chose leaders and told them to be like shepherds for my people Israel. But did I ever say anything to even one of them about building a cedar temple for me?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">David, this is what I, the Lord All-Powerful, say to you. I brought you in from the fields where you took care of sheep, and I made you the leader of my people.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Wherever you went, I helped you and destroyed your enemies right in front of your eyes. I have made you one of the most famous people in the world.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">I have given my people Israel a land of their own where they can live in peace, and they won't have to tremble with fear any more. Evil nations won't bother them, as they did</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">when I let judges rule my people. And I have kept your enemies from attacking you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">I'll choose one of your sons to be king when you reach the end of your life and are buried in the tomb of your ancestors. I'll make him a strong ruler,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">and no one will be able to take his kingdom away from him. He will be the one to build a temple for me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">I will be his father, and he will be my son.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="16">I will make sure that one of your descendants will always be king.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Nathan told David exactly what he had heard in the vision.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">David went into the tent he had set up for the sacred chest. Then he sat there and prayed:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">and yet you have promised to do even more. Is this the way you usually treat people?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">I am your servant, and you know my thoughts, so there is nothing more that I need to say.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">You have done this wonderful thing, and you have let me know about it, because you wanted to keep your promise.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Lord All-Powerful, you are greater than all others. No one is like you, and you alone are God. Everything we have heard about you is true.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">And there is no other nation on earth like Israel, the nation you rescued from slavery in Egypt to be your own. You became famous by using great and wonderful miracles to force other nations and their gods out of your land, so your people could live here.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">You have chosen Israel to be your people forever, and you have become their God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">And now, Lord God, please do what you have promised me and my descendants.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">Then you will be famous forever, and everyone will say, &amp;apos;The Lord God All-Powerful rules Israel, and David's descendants are his chosen kings.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">After all, you really are Israel's God, the Lord All-Powerful. You've told me that you will let my descendants be kings. That's why I have the courage to pray to you like this, even though I am only your servant.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">Lord All-Powerful, you are God. You have promised me some very good things, and you can be trusted to do what you promise.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">Please bless my descendants and let them always be your chosen kings. You have already promised, and I'm sure that you will bless my family forever.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="7">David heard what they had done, and he sent out Joab with all of his well-trained soldiers.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1">and he sent Nathan the prophet to tell this story to David: A rich man and a poor man lived in the same town. You are that rich man! Now listen to what the Lord God of Israel says to you: &amp;apos;I chose you to be the king of Israel. I kept you safe from Saul The Lord made David's young son very sick. &amp;apos;Yes, he did,&amp;apos; they answered. While he was still alive, I went without food and cried because there was still hope. I said to myself, &amp;apos;Who knows? Maybe the Lord will have pity on me and let the child live.&amp;apos; I have attacked Rabbah and captured the fortress guarding the city water supply. David went back to Jerusalem, and the people of Israel returned to their homes.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">The rich man owned a lot of sheep and cattle,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">but the poor man had only one little lamb that he had bought and raised. The lamb became a pet for him and his children. He even let it eat from his plate and drink from his cup and sleep on his lap. The lamb was like one of his own children.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">One day someone came to visit the rich man, but the rich man didn't want to kill any of his own sheep or cattle and serve it to the visitor. So he stole the poor man's lamb and served it instead.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="9">Then she took the bread out of the pan and put it on his plate, but he refused to eat it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">he said to Tamar, &amp;apos;Serve the food in my bedroom.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">But as she was taking it over to him, he grabbed her and said, &amp;apos;Come to bed with me!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">She answered, &amp;apos;No! Please don't force me! This sort of thing isn't done in Israel. It's disgusting!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Think of me. I'll be disgraced forever! And think of yourself. Everyone in Israel will say you're nothing but trash! Just ask the king, and he will let you marry me.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">But Amnon would not listen to what she said. He was stronger than she was, so he overpowered her and raped her.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Then Amnon hated her even more than he had loved her before. So he told her, &amp;apos;Get up and get out!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">She said, &amp;apos;Don't send me away! That would be worse than what you have already done.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">He called in his servant and said, &amp;apos;Throw this woman out and lock the door!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">The servant made her leave, and he locked the door behind her. The king's unmarried daughters used to wear long robes with sleeves. Absalom prepared a banquet fit for a king. One of the guards noticed a lot of people coming along the hillside on the road to Horonaim. He went and told the king, &amp;apos;I saw some men coming along Horonaim Road.&amp;apos; Absalom had run away to Geshur, where he stayed for three years with King Talmai the son of Ammihud.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Tamar tore the robe she was wearing and put ashes on her head. Then she covered her face with her hands and cried loudly as she walked away.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Tamar's brother Absalom said to her, &amp;apos;How could Amnon have done such a terrible thing to you! But since he's your brother, don't tell anyone what happened. Just try not to think about it.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">When David heard what had happened to Tamar, he was very angry. But Amnon was his oldest son and also his favorite, and David would not do anything to make Amnon unhappy.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Absalom treated Amnon as though nothing had happened, but he hated Amnon for what he had done to his sister Tamar.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">Two years later, Absalom's servants were cutting wool from his sheep in Baal-Hazor near the town of Ephraim, and Absalom invited all of the king's sons to be there.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">Then he went to David and said, &amp;apos;My servants are cutting the wool from my sheep. Please come and join us!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">David answered, &amp;apos;No, my son, we won't go. It would be too expensive for you.&amp;apos; Absalom tried to get him to change his mind, but David did not want to go. He only said that he hoped they would have a good time.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">Absalom said, &amp;apos;If you won't go, at least let my brother Amnon come with us.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">But Absalom kept on insisting, and finally David let Amnon and all his other sons go with Absalom.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">But he told his servants, &amp;apos;Keep an eye on Amnon. When he gets a little drunk from the wine and is feeling relaxed, I'll give the signal. Then kill him! I've commanded you to do it, so don't be afraid. Be strong and brave.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">Absalom's servants killed Amnon, just as Absalom had told them. The rest of the king's sons quickly rode away on their mules to escape from Absalom.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">While they were on their way to Jerusalem, someone told David, &amp;apos;Absalom has killed all of your sons! Not even one is left.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">David got up, and in his sorrow he tore his clothes and lay down on the ground. His servants remained standing, but they tore their clothes too.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">Then David's nephew Jonadab said, &amp;apos;Your Majesty, not all of your sons were killed! Only Amnon is dead. On the day that Amnon raped Tamar, Absalom decided to kill him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">Don't worry about the report that all your sons were killed. Only Amnon is dead,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">and Absalom has run away.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">Jonadab said, &amp;apos;Your Majesty, look! Here come your sons now, just as I told you.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">No sooner had he said it, than David's sons came in. They were weeping out loud, and David and all his officials cried just as loudly.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">David still felt so sad over the loss of Amnon that he wanted to take his army there and capture Absalom.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="14">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Joab knew that David couldn't stop thinking about Absalom,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">The woman from Tekoa went to David. She bowed very low and said, &amp;apos;Your Majesty, please help me!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">David asked, &amp;apos;What's the matter?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">I had two sons, but they got into a fight out in a field where there was no one to pull them apart, and one of them killed the other.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Now all of my relatives have come to me and said, &amp;apos;Hand over your son! We're going to put him to death for killing his brother.&amp;apos; But what they really want is to get rid of him, so they can take over our land.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">&amp;apos;Go on home,&amp;apos; David told her. &amp;apos;I'll take care of this matter for you.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">The woman said, &amp;apos;I hope your decision doesn't cause any problems for you. But if it does, you can blame me.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">He said, &amp;apos;If anyone gives you trouble, bring them to me, and it won't happen again!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">&amp;apos;Please,&amp;apos; she replied, &amp;apos;swear by the Lord your God that no one will be allowed to kill my son!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Then she asked, &amp;apos;Your Majesty, may I say something?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">The woman said:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">We each must die and disappear like water poured out on the ground. But God doesn't take our lives. Instead, he figures out ways of bringing us back when we run away.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Your Majesty, I came here to tell you about my problem, because I was afraid of what someone might do to me. I decided to come to you, because I thought you could help.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">In fact, I knew that you would listen and save my son and me from those who want to take the land that God gave us.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">I can rest easy now that you have given your decision. You know the difference between right and wrong just like an angel of God, and I pray that the Lord your God will be with you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Then David said to the woman, &amp;apos;Now I'm going to ask you a question, and don't try to hide the truth!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">David asked, &amp;apos;Did Joab put you up to this?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">but only to show you the other side of this problem. You must be as wise as the angel of God to know everything that goes on in this country.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">David turned to Joab and said, &amp;apos;It seems that I have already given my decision. Go and bring Absalom back.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Joab bowed very low and said, &amp;apos;Your Majesty, I thank you for giving your permission. It shows that you approve of me.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">Joab went to Geshur to get Absalom. But when they came back to Jerusalem,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">David told Joab, &amp;apos;I don't want to see my son Absalom. Tell him to stay away from me.&amp;apos; So Absalom went to his own house without seeing his father.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">No one in all Israel was as handsome and well-built as Absalom.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">His hair grew so thick and heavy that when he got it cut once a year, it weighed over two kilograms.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">Absalom had three sons. He also had a daughter named Tamar, who grew up to be very beautiful.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">Absalom lived in Jerusalem for two years without seeing his father.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">He wanted Joab to talk to David for him. So one day he sent a message asking Joab to come over, but Joab refused. Absalom sent another message, but Joab still refused.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">Finally, Absalom told his servants, &amp;apos;Joab's barley field is right next to mine. Go set it on fire!&amp;apos; And they did.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">Joab went to Absalom's house and demanded, &amp;apos;Why did your servants set my field on fire?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">Absalom answered, &amp;apos;You didn't pay any attention when I sent for you. I want you to ask my father why he told me to come back from Geshur. I was better off there. I want to see my father now! If I'm guilty, let him kill me.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">Joab went to David and told him what Absalom had said. David sent for Absalom, and Absalom came. He bowed very low, and David leaned over and kissed him.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="15">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Some time later, Absalom got himself a chariot with horses to pull it, and he had 50 men run in front.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">He would get up early each morning and wait by the side of the road that led to the city gate. Anyone who had a complaint to bring to King David would have to go that way, and Absalom would ask each of them, &amp;apos;Where are you from?&amp;apos; If they said, &amp;apos;I'm from a tribe in the north,&amp;apos; More and more people were joining Absalom and supporting his plot. Meanwhile, Absalom had secretly sent some messengers to the northern tribes of Israel. The messengers told everyone, &amp;apos;When you hear the sound of the trumpets, you must shout, &amp;quot;Absalom now rules as king in Hebron!&amp;quot; &amp;apos; They stopped at the last house at the edge of the city. So Ittai and all his men and their families walked on past David. Zadok, take the sacred chest back to Jerusalem. If the Lord is pleased with me, he will bring me back and let me see it and his tent again. David said, &amp;apos;Please, Lord , keep Ahithophel's plans from working!&amp;apos; Hushai, if you do that, you can help me ruin Ahithophel's plans.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Absalom would say, &amp;apos;You deserve to win your case. It's too bad the king doesn't have anyone to hear complaints like yours.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">I wish someone would make me the judge around here! I would be fair to everyone.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Whenever anyone came to Absalom and started bowing down, he would reach out and hug and kiss them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">That's how he treated everyone from Israel who brought a complaint to the king. Soon everyone in Israel liked Absalom better than they liked David.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Four years later, Absalom said to David, &amp;apos;Please, let me go to Hebron. I have to keep a promise that I made to the Lord ,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">when I was living with the Arameans in Geshur. I promised that if the Lord would bring me back to live in Jerusalem, I would worship him in Hebron.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">David gave his permission, and Absalom went to Hebron.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">A messenger came and told David, &amp;apos;Everyone in Israel is on Absalom's side!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">David's officials were in Jerusalem with him, and he told them, &amp;apos;Let's get out of here! We'll have to leave soon, or none of us will escape from Absalom. Hurry! If he moves fast, he could catch us while we're still here. Then he will kill us and everyone else in the city.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">The officials said, &amp;apos;Your Majesty, we'll do whatever you say.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Then David stood there and watched while his regular troops and his bodyguards marched past. The last group was the 600 soldiers who had followed him from Gath. Their commander was Ittai.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">David spoke to Ittai and said, &amp;apos;You're a foreigner from the town of Gath. You don't have to leave with us. Go back and join the new king!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">You haven't been with me very long, so why should you have to follow me, when I don't even know where I'm going? Take your soldiers and go back. I pray that the Lord will be kind and faithful to you.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Ittai answered, &amp;apos;Your Majesty, just as surely as you and the Lord live, I will go where you go, no matter if it costs me my life.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">&amp;apos;Then come on!&amp;apos; David said.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">The people of Jerusalem were crying and moaning as David and everyone with him passed by. He led them across Kidron Valley and along the road toward the desert.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">Zadok and Abiathar the priests were there along with several men from the tribe of Levi who were carrying the sacred chest. They set the chest down, and left it there until David and his followers had gone out of the city.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">Then David said:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">But if he says he isn't pleased with me, then let him do what he knows is best.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">Zadok, you are a good judge of things, so return to the city and don't cause any trouble. Take your son Ahimaaz with you. Abiathar and his son Jonathan will also go back.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">I'll wait at the river crossing in the desert until I hear from you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">Zadok and Abiathar took the sacred chest back into Jerusalem and stayed there.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">David went on up the slope of the Mount of Olives. He was barefoot and crying, and he covered his head to show his sorrow. Everyone with him was crying, and they covered their heads too.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">Someone told David, &amp;apos;Ahithophel is helping Absalom plot against you!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">When David reached the top of the Mount of Olives, he met Hushai the Archite at a place of worship. Hushai's robe was torn, and dust was on his head.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">David told him: If you come with me, you might slow us down.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">Go back into the city and tell Absalom, &amp;apos;Your Majesty, I am your servant. I will serve you now, just as I served your father in the past.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">Zadok and Abiathar the priests will be there with you, and you can tell them everything you hear in the palace.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">Then they can send their sons Ahimaaz and Jonathan to tell me what you've heard.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">David's advisor Hushai slipped back into Jerusalem, at just about the same time Absalom was coming in.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="16">
			<VERS vnumber="1">David had started down the other side of the Mount of Olives, when he was met by Ziba, the chief servant of Mephibosheth. Ziba had two donkeys that were carrying 200 loaves of bread, 100 handfuls of raisins, 100 figs, and some wine. Ziba said, &amp;apos;The donkeys are for your family to ride. The bread and fruit are for the people to eat, and the wine is for them to drink in the desert when they are tired out.&amp;apos; Ziba answered, &amp;apos;He stayed in Jerusalem, because he thinks the people of Israel want him to rule the kingdom of his grandfather Saul.&amp;apos; Ziba said, &amp;apos;Your Majesty, I am your humble servant, and I hope you will be pleased with me.&amp;apos; My own son is trying to kill me! Why shouldn't this man from the tribe of Benjamin want me dead even more? Let him curse all he wants. Maybe the Lord did tell him to curse me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">&amp;apos;What's all this?&amp;apos; David asked.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">&amp;apos;And where is Mephibosheth?&amp;apos; David asked.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">David then told him, &amp;apos;Everything that used to belong to Mephibosheth is now yours.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">David was near the town of Bahurim when a man came out and started cursing him. The man was Shimei the son of Gera, and he was one of Saul's distant relatives.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">He threw stones at David, at his soldiers, and at everyone else, including the bodyguards who walked on each side of David.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Shimei was yelling at David, &amp;apos;Get out of here, you murderer! You good-for-nothing,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">the Lord is paying you back for killing so many in Saul's family. You stole his kingdom, but now the Lord has given it to your son Absalom. You're a murderer, and that's why you're in such big trouble!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Abishai said, &amp;apos;Your Majesty, this man is as useless as a dead dog! He shouldn't be allowed to curse you. Let me go over and chop off his head.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">David replied, &amp;apos;What will I ever do with you and your brother Joab? If Shimei is cursing me because the Lord has told him to, then who are you to tell him to stop?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Then David said to Abishai and all his soldiers:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">But if the Lord hears these curses and sees the trouble I'm in, maybe he will have pity on me instead.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">David and the others went on down the road. Shimei went along the hillside by the road, cursing and throwing rocks and dirt at them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">When David and those with him came to the Jordan River, they were tired out. But after they rested, they felt much better.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">By this time, Absalom, Ahithophel, and the others had reached Jerusalem.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">David's friend Hushai came to Absalom and said, &amp;apos;Long live the king! Long live the king!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">But Absalom asked Hushai, &amp;apos;Is this how you show loyalty to your friend David? Why didn't you go with him?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Hushai answered, &amp;apos;The Lord and the people of Israel have chosen you to be king. I can't leave. I have to stay and serve the one they've chosen.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Besides, it seems right for me to serve you, just as I served your father.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Absalom turned to Ahithophel and said, &amp;apos;Give us your advice! What should we do?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Ahithophel answered, &amp;apos;Some of your father's wives were left here to take care of the palace. You should have sex with them. Then everyone will find out that you have publicly disgraced your father. This will make you and your followers even more powerful.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Absalom had a tent set up on the flat roof of the palace, and everyone watched as he went into the tent with his father's wives.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">Ahithophel gave such good advice in those days that both Absalom and David thought it came straight from God.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="17">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Ahithophel said to Absalom: Let me choose 12,000 men and attack David tonight, This time Ahithophel's advice isn't so good. As soon as anyone hears that some of your soldiers have been killed, everyone will think your whole army has been destroyed. The woman answered, &amp;apos;They went across that stream.&amp;apos; The soldiers went off to look for the two men. But when they did not find the men, they went back to Jerusalem. They brought the food for David and the others because they knew that everyone would be hungry, tired, and thirsty from being out in the desert.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">while he is tired and discouraged. He will panic, and everyone with him will run away. I won't kill anyone except David,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">since he's the one you want to get rid of. Then I'll bring the whole nation back to you like a bride coming home to her husband. This way there won't be a civil war.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Absalom and all the leaders of the tribes of Israel agreed that Ahithophel had a good plan.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Then Absalom said, &amp;apos;Bring in Hushai the Archite. Let's hear what he has to say.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Hushai came in, and Absalom told him what Ahithophel had planned. Then Absalom said, &amp;apos;Should we do what he says? And if we shouldn't, can you come up with anything better?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Hushai said:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">You know that your father and his followers are real warriors. Now they are as fierce as a mother bear whose cubs have just been killed. Besides, your father has a lot of experience in fighting wars, and he won't be spending the night with the others.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">He has probably already found a hiding place in a cave or somewhere else.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Then even those who are as brave as a lion will lose their courage. All Israel knows what a great warrior your father is and what brave soldiers he has.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">My advice is to gather all the fighting men of Israel from the town of Dan in the north down to the town of Beersheba in the south. You will have more soldiers than there are grains of sand on the seashore. Absalom, you should lead them yourself,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">and we will all go to fight David wherever he is. We will fall on him just as dew falls and covers the ground. He and all his soldiers will die!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">If they go into a walled town, we will put ropes around that town and drag it into the river. We won't leave even one small piece of a stone.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Absalom and the others liked Hushai's plan better than Ahithophel's plan. This was because the Lord had decided to keep Ahithophel's plan from working and to cause trouble for Absalom.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">At once, Hushai went to Zadok and Abiathar. He told them what advice Ahithophel had given to Absalom and to the leaders of Israel. He also told them about the advice he had given.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Then he said, &amp;apos;Hurry! Send someone to warn David not to spend the night on this side of the Jordan. He must get across the river, so he and the others won't be wiped out!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Jonathan and Ahimaaz had been waiting at Rogel Spring because they did not want to be seen in Jerusalem. A servant girl went to the spring and gave them the message for David.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">But a young man saw them and went to tell Absalom. So Jonathan and Ahimaaz left and hurried to the house of a man who lived in Bahurim. Then they climbed down into a well in the courtyard.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">The man's wife put the cover on the well and poured grain on top of it, so the well could not be seen.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Absalom's soldiers came to the woman and demanded, &amp;apos;Where are Ahimaaz and Jonathan?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">After the soldiers had gone, Jonathan and Ahimaaz climbed out of the well. They went to David and said, &amp;apos;Hurry! Get ready to cross the river!&amp;apos; Then they told him about Ahithophel's plan.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">David and the others got ready and started crossing the Jordan River. By sunrise all of them were on the other side.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">When Ahithophel saw that Absalom and the leaders of Israel were not going to follow his advice, he saddled his donkey and rode back to his home in Gilo. He told his family and servants what to do. Then he hanged himself, and they buried him in his family's burial place.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">David went to the town of Mahanaim, and Absalom crossed the Jordan River with the army of Israel.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">Absalom put Amasa in Joab's place as commander of the army. Amasa's father was Ithra from the family of Ishmael, and his mother was Abigal, the daughter of Nahash and the sister of Joab's mother Zeruiah.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">The Israelites under Absalom's command set up camp in the region of Gilead.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">After David came to the town of Mahanaim, Shobi the son of Nahash came from Rabbah in Ammon, Machir the son of Ammiel came from Lo-Debar, and Barzillai the Gileadite came from Rogelim.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="18">
			<VERS vnumber="1">David divided his soldiers into groups of 100 and groups of 1,000. Then he chose officers to be in command of each group.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">He sent out one third of his army under the command of Joab, another third under the command of Abishai the son of Zeruiah, and the rest under the command of Ittai from Gath. He told the soldiers, &amp;apos;I'm going into battle with you.&amp;apos; Then in a voice loud enough for everyone to hear, he said, &amp;apos;Joab! Abishai! Ittai! For my sake, be sure that Absalom comes back unharmed.&amp;apos; David stood beside the town gate as his army marched past in groups of 100 and in groups of 1,000. The war with Israel took place in Ephraim Forest. Absalom was still alive, so Joab took three spears and stuck them through Absalom's chest. Meanwhile, the people of Israel had all run back to their own homes. Joab said, &amp;apos;Why should you go? You won't get a reward for the news you have!&amp;apos; &amp;apos;All right then, run!&amp;apos; Joab said. Ahimaaz took the road through the Jordan Valley and outran the Ethiopian. David answered, &amp;apos;If he's alone, he must have some news.&amp;apos; The runner was getting closer, David said, &amp;apos;He must have some news too.&amp;apos; This time David said, &amp;apos;He's a good man. He must have some good news.&amp;apos; Ahimaaz said, &amp;apos;When Joab sent your personal servant and me, I saw a noisy crowd. But I don't know what it was all about.&amp;apos; Ahimaaz went over and stood there. The Ethiopian replied, &amp;apos;I wish that all Your Majesty's enemies and everyone who tries to harm you would end up like him!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">But the soldiers said, &amp;apos;No, don't go into battle with us! It won't matter to our enemies if they make us all run away, or even if they kill half of us. But you are worth 10,000 of us. It would be better for you to stay in town and send help if we need it.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Absalom was riding his mule under a huge tree when his head caught in the branches. The mule ran off and left Absalom hanging in midair. Some of David's soldiers happened by,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">and one of them went and told Joab, &amp;apos;I saw Absalom hanging in a tree!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Joab said, &amp;apos;You saw Absalom? Why didn't you kill him? I would have given you ten pieces of silver and a special belt.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">The man answered, &amp;apos;Even if you paid me 1,000 pieces of silver here and now, I still wouldn't touch the king's son. We all heard King David tell you and Abishai and Ittai not to harm Absalom.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">He always finds out what's going on. I would have been risking my life to kill Absalom, because you would have let me take the blame.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Joab said, &amp;apos;I'm not going to waste any more time on you!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Ten of Joab's bodyguards came over and finished him off.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Then Joab blew a trumpet to signal his troops to stop chasing Israel's soldiers.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">They threw Absalom's body into a deep pit in the forest and put a big pile of rocks over it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">When Absalom was alive, he had set up a stone monument for himself in King's Valley. He explained, &amp;apos;I don't have any sons to keep my name alive.&amp;apos; He called it Absalom's Monument, and that is the name it still has today.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Ahimaaz the son of Zadok said, &amp;apos;Joab, let me run and tell King David that the Lord has rescued him from his enemies.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Joab answered, &amp;apos;You're not the one to tell the king that his son is dead. You can take him a message some other time, but not today.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Someone from Ethiopia was standing there, and Joab told him, &amp;apos;Go and tell the king what you have seen.&amp;apos; The man knelt down in front of Joab, then got up and started running.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Ahimaaz spoke to Joab again, &amp;apos;No matter what happens, I still want to go. And besides, the Ethiopian has already left.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">&amp;apos;I'll run no matter what!&amp;apos; Ahimaaz insisted.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">Meanwhile, David was sitting between the inner and outer gates in the city wall. One of his soldiers was watching from the roof of the gate-tower. He saw a man running toward the town</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">and shouted down to tell David.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">when the soldier saw someone else running. He shouted down to the gate, &amp;apos;Look! There's another runner!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">The soldier on the roof shouted, &amp;apos;The first one runs just like Ahimaaz the son of Zadok.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">Ahimaaz called out, &amp;apos;We won! We won!&amp;apos; Then he bowed low to David and said, &amp;apos;Your Majesty, praise the Lord your God! He has given you victory over your enemies.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">&amp;apos;Is my son Absalom all right?&amp;apos; David asked.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">David told him, &amp;apos;Stand over there and wait.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">The Ethiopian came and said, &amp;apos;Your Majesty, today I have good news! The Lord has rescued you from all your enemies!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">&amp;apos;Is my son Absalom all right?&amp;apos; David asked.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">David started trembling. Then he went up to the room above the city gate to cry. As he went, he kept saying, &amp;apos;My son Absalom! My son, my son Absalom! I wish I could have died instead of you! Absalom, my son, my son!&amp;apos;</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="19">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Someone told Joab, &amp;apos;The king is crying because Absalom is dead.&amp;apos; You've made your soldiers ashamed! Not only did they save your life, they saved your sons and daughters and wives as well. After Israel's soldiers had all returned home, Say to the leaders of Judah, &amp;apos;Why are you the last tribe to think about bringing King David back home? Shimei crossed the Jordan River and bowed down in front of David. Your Majesty, why should I go to Jerusalem? I don't have much longer to live. All of Judah's army and half of Israel's army were there to help David cross the river. The people of Judah argued more strongly than the people of Israel.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">David's army found out he was crying because his son had died, and their day of victory suddenly turned into a day of sadness.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">The troops were sneaking into Mahanaim, just as if they had run away from a battle and were ashamed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">David covered his face with his hands and kept on crying loudly, &amp;apos;My son, Absalom! Absalom, my son, my son!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Joab went to the house where David was staying and told him:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">You're more loyal to your enemies than to your friends. What you've done today has shown your officers and soldiers that they don't mean a thing to you. You would be happy if Absalom was still alive, even if the rest of us were dead.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Now get up! Go out there and thank them for what they did. If you don't, I swear by the Lord that you won't even have one man left on your side tomorrow morning. You may have had a lot of troubles in the past, but this will be the worst thing that has ever happened to you!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">David got up and went to the town gate and sat down. When the people heard that he was sitting there, they came to see him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">When David found out what they were saying, he sent a message to Zadok and Abiathar the priests. It said:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">He is your brother, your own relative! Why haven't you done anything to bring him back?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">And tell Amasa, &amp;apos;You're my nephew, and with God as a witness, I swear I'll make you commander of my army instead of Joab.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Soon the tribe of Judah again became followers of David, and they sent him this message: &amp;apos;Come back, and bring your soldiers with you.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">David started back and had gone as far as the Jordan River when he met the people of Judah. They had gathered at Gilgal and had come to help him cross the river.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Shimei the son of Gera was there with them. He had hurried from Bahurim to meet David. Shimei was from the tribe of Benjamin, and</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">1,000 others from Benjamin had come with him. Ziba, the chief servant of Saul's family, also came to the Jordan River. He and his 15 sons and 20 servants waded across to meet David.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Then they brought David's family and servants back across the river, and they did everything he wanted them to do.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">He said, &amp;apos;Your Majesty, I beg you not to punish me! Please, forget what I did when you were leaving Jerusalem. Don't even think about it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">I know I was wrong. That's why I wanted to be the first one from the northern tribes to meet you.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">But Abishai shouted, &amp;apos;You should be killed for cursing the Lord 's chosen king!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">David said, &amp;apos;Abishai, what will I ever do with you and your brother Joab? Is it your job to tell me who has done wrong? I've been made king of all Israel today, and no one will be put to death!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">Then David promised Shimei that he would not be killed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">He answered, &amp;apos;Your Majesty, you know I can't walk. I told my servant to saddle a donkey for me so I could go with you. But my servant left without me, and</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">then he lied about me. You're as wise as an angel of God, so do what you think is right.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">After all, you could have killed my whole family and me. But instead, you let me eat at your own table. Your Majesty, what more could I ask?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">David answered, &amp;apos;You've said enough! I've decided to divide the property between you and Ziba.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">Mephibosheth replied, &amp;apos;He can have it all! I'm just glad you've come home safely.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">Barzillai came from Rogelim in Gilead to meet David at the Jordan River and go across with him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">Barzillai was 80 years old. He was very rich and had sent food to David in Mahanaim.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">David said to him, &amp;apos;Cross the river and go to Jerusalem with me. I will take care of you.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">Barzillai answered:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">I'm already 80 years old, and my body is almost numb. I can't taste my food or hear the sound of singing, and I would be nothing but a burden.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">I'll cross the river with you, but I'll only go a little way on the other side. You don't have to be so kind to me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">Just let me return to my hometown, where I can someday be buried near my father and mother. My servant Chimham can go with you, and you can treat him as your own.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">David said, &amp;apos;I'll take Chimham with me, and whatever you ask me to do for him, I'll do. And if there's anything else you want, I'll also do that.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">David's soldiers went on across the river, while he stayed behind to tell Barzillai goodbye and to wish him well. Barzillai returned home, but</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">Chimham crossed the river with David.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">The soldiers from Israel came to him and said, &amp;apos;Why did our relatives from Judah secretly take you and your family and your soldiers across the Jordan?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">The people of Judah answered, &amp;apos;Why are you so angry? We are the king's relatives. He didn't give us any food, and we didn't take anything for ourselves!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43">Those from Israel said, &amp;apos;King David belongs to us ten times more than he belongs to you. Why didn't you think we were good enough to help you? After all, we were the first ones to think of bringing him back!&amp;apos;</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="20">
			<VERS vnumber="1">A troublemaker from the tribe of Benjamin was there. His name was Sheba the son of Bichri, and he blew a trumpet to get everyone's attention. Then he said, &amp;apos;People of Israel, David the son of Jesse doesn't belong to us! Let's go home.&amp;apos; Joab and his brother Abishai went off to chase Sheba. &amp;apos;Yes, I am,&amp;apos; he answered. She said, &amp;apos;Please, listen to what I have to say.&amp;apos; &amp;apos;All right,&amp;apos; he said. &amp;apos;I'll listen.&amp;apos; The woman told Joab, &amp;apos;We will throw his head over the wall.&amp;apos; Joab blew a signal on his trumpet, and the soldiers returned to their homes. Joab went back to David in Jerusalem. Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud kept government records. Zadok and Abiathar were the priests.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">So they stopped following David and went off with Sheba. But the people of Judah stayed close to David all the way from the Jordan to Jerusalem.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">David had left ten of his wives in Jerusalem to take care of his palace. But when he came back, he had them taken to another house, and he placed soldiers there to guard them. He gave them whatever they needed, but he never slept with any of them again. They had to live there for the rest of their lives as if they were widows.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">David said to Amasa, &amp;apos;Three days from now I want you and all of Judah's army to be here!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Amasa started bringing the army together, but it was taking him more than three days.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">So David said to Abishai, &amp;apos;Sheba will hurt us more than Absalom ever did. Take my best soldiers and go after him. We don't want him to take over any walled cities and get away from us.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Abishai left Jerusalem to try and capture Sheba. He took along Joab and his soldiers, as well as David's bodyguard and best troops.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">They had gone as far as the big rock at Gibeon when Amasa caught up with them. Joab had a dagger strapped around his waist over his military uniform, but it fell out as he started toward Amasa.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Joab said, &amp;apos;Amasa, my cousin, how are you?&amp;apos; Then Joab took hold of Amasa's beard with his right hand, so that he could greet him with a kiss.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Amasa did not see the dagger in Joab's other hand. Joab stuck it in Amasa's stomach, and his insides spilled out on the ground. Joab only struck him once, but Amasa was dying.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">One of Joab's soldiers stood by Amasa and shouted, &amp;apos;If any of you are for Joab and David, then follow Joab!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Amasa was still rolling in his own blood in the middle of the road. The soldier who had shouted noticed that everyone who passed by would stop, so he dragged Amasa off the road and covered him with a blanket.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">After this, no one else stopped. They all walked straight past him on their way to help Joab capture Sheba.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Sheba had gone through all of the tribes of Israel when he came to the town of Abel Beth-Maacah. All of his best soldiers met him there and followed him into the town.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Joab and his troops came and surrounded Abel, so that no one could go in or come out. They made a dirt ramp up to the town wall and then started to use a battering ram to knock the wall down.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">A wise woman shouted from the top of the wall, &amp;apos;Listen to me! Listen to me! I have to talk to Joab! Tell him to come here!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">When he came, the woman said, &amp;apos;Are you Joab?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">She said, &amp;apos;Long ago people used to say, &amp;quot;If you want good advice, go to the town of Abel to get it.&amp;quot; The answers they got here were all that was needed to settle any problem.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">We are Israelites, and we want peace! You can trust us. Why are you trying to destroy a town that's like a mother in Israel? Why do you want to wipe out the Lord 's people?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Joab answered, &amp;apos;No, no! I'm not trying to wipe you out or destroy your town!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">That's not it at all. There's a man in your town from the hill country of Ephraim. His name is Sheba, and he is the leader of a rebellion against King David. Turn him over to me, and we will leave your town alone.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">She went to the people of the town and talked them into doing it. They cut off Sheba's head and threw it to Joab.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">Joab was the commander of Israel's entire army. Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was in command of David's bodyguard.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">Adoram was in charge of the slave-labor force.</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="21">
			<VERS vnumber="1">While David was king, there were three years in a row when the nation of Israel could not grow enough food. So David asked the Lord for help, and the Lord answered, &amp;apos;Saul and his family are guilty of murder, because he had the Gibeonites killed.&amp;apos; David had the Gibeonites come, and he talked with them. &amp;apos;I'll give them to you,&amp;apos; David said. David's soldiers told him, &amp;apos;We can't let you risk your life in battle anymore! You give light to our nation, and we want that flame to keep burning.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">The Gibeonites were not Israelites; they were descendants of the Amorites. The people of Israel had promised not to kill them, but Saul had tried to kill them because he wanted Israel and Judah to control all the land.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">He said, &amp;apos;What can I do to make up for what Saul did, so that you'll ask the Lord to be kind to his people again?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">The Gibeonites answered, &amp;apos;Silver and gold from Saul and his family are not enough. On the other hand, we don't have the right to put any Israelite to death.&amp;apos; David said, &amp;apos;I'll do whatever you ask.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">They replied, &amp;apos;Saul tried to kill all our people so that none of us would be left in the land of Israel.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Give us seven of his descendants. We will hang these men near the place where the Lord is worshiped in Gibeah, the hometown of Saul, the Lord 's chosen king.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">David had made a promise to Jonathan with the Lord as his witness, so he spared Jonathan's son Mephibosheth, the grandson of Saul.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">But Saul and Rizpah the daughter of Aiah had two sons named Armoni and Mephibosheth. Saul's daughter Merab had five sons whose father was Adriel the son of Barzillai from Meholah. David took Rizpah's two sons and Merab's five sons and</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">turned them over to the Gibeonites, who hanged all seven of them on the mountain near the place where the Lord was worshiped. This happened right at the beginning of the barley harvest.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Rizpah spread out some sackcloth on a nearby rock. She wouldn't let the birds land on the bodies during the day, and she kept the wild animals away at night. She stayed there from the beginning of the harvest until it started to rain.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">One time David got very tired when he and his soldiers were fighting the Philistines.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">One of the Philistine warriors was Ishbibenob, who was a descendant of the Rephaim, and he tried to kill David. Ishbibenob was armed with a new sword, and his bronze spearhead alone weighed about three and a half kilograms.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">But Abishai came to the rescue and killed the Philistine.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">There was another battle with the Philistines at Gob, where Sibbecai from Hushah killed a descendant of the Rephaim named Saph.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">There was still another battle with the Philistines at Gob. A soldier named Elhanan killed Goliath from Gath, whose spear shaft was like a weaver's beam. Elhanan's father was Jari from Bethlehem.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">There was another war, this time in Gath. One of the enemy soldiers was a descendant of the Rephaim. He was as big as a giant and had six fingers on each hand and six toes on each foot.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">But when he made fun of Israel, David's nephew Jonathan killed him. Jonathan was the son of David's brother Shimei.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">David and his soldiers killed these four men who were descendants of the Rephaim from Gath.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="15">and he was very thirsty. He said, &amp;apos;I wish I had a drink from the well by the gate at Bethlehem.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">The Three Warriors sneaked into the Philistine camp and got some water from the well near Bethlehem's gate. But after they brought the water back to David, he refused to drink it. Instead, he poured it out as a sacrifice</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">and said to the Lord , &amp;apos;I can't drink this water! It's like the blood of these men who risked their lives to get it for me.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Joab's brother Abishai was the leader of the Thirty Warriors, and in one battle he killed 300 men with his spear. He was as famous as the Three Warriors</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">and certainly just as famous as the rest of the Thirty Warriors. He was the commander of the Thirty Warriors, but he still did not become one of the Three Warriors.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was a brave man from Kabzeel who did some amazing things. He killed two of Moab's best fighters, and on a snowy day he went down into a pit and killed a lion.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Another time, he killed an Egyptian, as big as a giant. The Egyptian was armed with a spear, but Benaiah only had a club. Benaiah grabbed the spear from the Egyptian and killed him with it.</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="24">
			<VERS vnumber="1">The Lord was angry with Israel again, and he made David think it would be a good idea to count the people in Israel and Judah.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">So David told Joab and the army officers, &amp;apos;Go to every tribe in Israel, from the town of Dan in the north all the way south to Beersheba, and count everyone who can serve in the army. I want to know how many there are.&amp;apos; When the angel was about to destroy Jerusalem, the Lord felt sorry for all the suffering he had caused and told the angel, &amp;apos;That's enough! Don't touch them.&amp;apos; This happened at the threshing place that belonged to Araunah the Jebusite. So David went. David answered, &amp;apos;I've come to buy your threshing place. I have to build the Lord an altar here, so this disease will stop killing the people.&amp;apos; The Lord answered the prayers of the people, and no one else died from the terrible disease.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Joab answered, &amp;apos;I hope the Lord your God will give you 100 times more soldiers than you already have. I hope you will live to see that day! But why do you want to do a thing like this?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">But when David refused to change his mind, Joab and the army officers went out and started counting the people.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">They crossed the Jordan River and began with Aroer and the town in the middle of the river valley. From there they went toward Gad and on as far as Jazer.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">They went to Gilead and to Kadesh in Syria. Then they went to Dan, Ijon, and on toward Sidon.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">They came to the fortress of Tyre, then went through every town of the Hivites and the Canaanites. Finally, they went to Beersheba in the Southern Desert of Judah.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">After they had gone through the whole land, they went back to Jerusalem. It had taken them 9 months and 20 days.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Joab came and told David, &amp;apos;In Israel there are 800,000 who can serve in the army, and in Judah there are 500,000.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">After everyone had been counted, David realized he had done wrong. He told the Lord , &amp;apos;What I did was stupid and terribly wrong. Lord , please forgive me.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Before David even got up the next morning, the Lord had told David's prophet Gad</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">David was really frightened and said, &amp;apos;It's a terrible choice to make! But the Lord is kind, and I'd rather be punished by him than by anyone else.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">David saw the angel killing everyone and told the Lord , &amp;apos;These people are like sheep with me as their shepherd. I have sinned terribly, but they have done nothing wrong. Please, punish me and my family instead of them!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Araunah looked and saw David and his soldiers coming up toward him. He went over to David, bowed down low,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">and said, &amp;apos;Your Majesty! Why have you come to see me?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Araunah said, &amp;apos;Take whatever you want and offer your sacrifice. Here are some oxen for the sacrifice. You can use the threshing-boards and the wooden yokes for the fire.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">Take them&amp;ndash;they're yours! I hope the Lord your God will be pleased with you.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">But David answered, &amp;apos;No! I have to pay you what they're worth. I can't offer the Lord my God a sacrifice that cost me nothing.&amp;apos; So David bought the threshing place and the oxen for 50 pieces of silver.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">Then he built an altar for the Lord . He offered sacrifices to please the Lord and to ask for his blessings.</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="1">
			<VERS vnumber="1">King David was now an old man, and he always felt cold, even under a lot of blankets.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">His officials said, &amp;apos;Your Majesty, we will look for a young woman to take care of you. She can lie down beside you and keep you warm.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Adonijah met with Joab the son of Zeruiah and Abiathar the priest and asked them if they would help him become king. Both of them agreed to help.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">But Zadok the priest, Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, Nathan the prophet, Shimei, Rei, and David's bodyguards all refused.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Adonijah invited his brothers and David's officials from Judah to go with him to Crawling Rock near Rogel Spring, where he sacrificed some sheep, cattle, and fat calves.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">But he did not invite Nathan, Benaiah, David's bodyguards, or his own brother Solomon.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">When Nathan heard what had happened, he asked Bathsheba, Solomon's mother:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">You and your son Solomon will be killed, unless you do what I tell you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Go say to David, &amp;apos;You promised me that Solomon would be the next king. So why is Adonijah now king?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">While you are still talking to David, I'll come in and tell him that everything you said is true.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Meanwhile, David was in his bedroom where Abishag was taking care of him because he was so old. Bathsheba went in</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">and bowed down.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Bathsheba answered:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">But Adonijah has already been made king, and you didn't know anything about it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">He sacrificed a lot of cattle, calves, and sheep. And he invited Abiathar the priest, Joab your army commander, and all your sons to be there, except Solomon, your loyal servant.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Your Majesty, everyone in Israel is waiting for you to announce who will be the next king.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">If you don't, they will say that Solomon and I have rebelled. They will treat us like criminals and kill us as soon as you die.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Just then, Nathan the prophet arrived.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">Someone told David that he was there, and Nathan came in. He bowed with his face to the ground</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">and said:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">Earlier today, he sacrificed a lot of cattle, calves, and sheep. He invited the army commanders, Abiathar, and all your sons to be there. They are already eating and drinking and shouting, &amp;apos;Long live King Adonijah!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">But he didn't invite me or Zadok the priest or Benaiah or Solomon.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">Did you say they could do this without telling the rest of us who would be the next king?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">David said, &amp;apos;Tell Bathsheba to come here.&amp;apos; She came and stood in front of him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">Bathsheba bowed with her face to the ground and said, &amp;apos;Your Majesty, I pray that you will live a long time!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">Then David said, &amp;apos;Tell Zadok, Nathan, and Benaiah to come here.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">he told them:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">When you get there, Zadok and Nathan will pour olive oil over Solomon's head to show that he is the new king of Israel. Then order someone to blow a trumpet and tell everyone to shout, &amp;apos;Long live King Solomon!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">Bring him back here, and he will take my place as king. He is the one I have chosen to rule Israel and Judah.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">Benaiah answered, &amp;apos;We will do it, Your Majesty. I pray that the Lord your God will let it happen.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">The Lord has always watched over you, and I pray that he will now watch over Solomon. May the Lord help Solomon to be an even greater king than you.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">Zadok, Nathan, and Benaiah left and took along the two groups of David's special bodyguards. Solomon rode on David's mule as they led him to Gihon Spring.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">Zadok the priest brought some olive oil from the sacred tent and poured it on Solomon's head to show that he was now king. A trumpet was blown and everyone shouted, &amp;apos;Long live King Solomon!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">Then they played flutes and celebrated as they followed Solomon back to Jerusalem. They made so much noise that the ground shook.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">Adonijah and his guests had almost finished eating when they heard the noise. Joab also heard the trumpet and asked, &amp;apos;What's all that noise about in the city?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">Just then, Jonathan son of Abiathar came running up. &amp;apos;Come in,&amp;apos; Adonijah said. &amp;apos;An important man like you must have some good news.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43">Jonathan answered:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46">Solomon is now king.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="47">And listen to this! David's officials told him, &amp;apos;We pray that your God will help Solomon to be an even greater king!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="48">and prayed, &amp;apos;I praise you, Lord God of Israel. You have made my son Solomon king and have let me live to see it.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="49">Adonijah's guests shook with fear when they heard this news, and they left as fast as they could.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="50">Adonijah himself was afraid of what Solomon might do to him, so he ran to the sacred tent and grabbed hold of the corners of the altar for protection.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="51">Someone told Solomon, &amp;apos;Adonijah is afraid of you and is holding onto the corners of the altar. He wants you to promise that you won't kill him.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="52">Solomon answered, &amp;apos;If Adonijah doesn't cause any trouble, I won't hurt him. But if he does, I'll have him killed.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="53">Then he sent someone to the altar to get Adonijah.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="2">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Not long before David died, he told Solomon: &amp;apos;Yes. &amp;apos;All right,&amp;apos; she told him, &amp;apos;go ahead.&amp;apos; &amp;apos;What do you want?&amp;apos; Bathsheba asked. Solomon replied, &amp;apos;Mother, just tell me what you want, and I will do it.&amp;apos; Abiathar, go back home to Anathoth! You ought to be killed too, but I won't do it now. When my father David was king, you were in charge of the sacred chest, and you went through a lot of hard times with my father. Then Solomon shouted, &amp;apos;Benaiah, go kill Joab!&amp;apos; &amp;apos;No!&amp;apos; Joab answered. &amp;apos;Kill me right here.&amp;apos; Benaiah went back and told Solomon what Joab had said. Do what Joab said. Kill him and bury him! Then my family and I won't be responsible for what he did to Abner the commander of Israel's army and to Amasa the commander of Judah's army. He killed those innocent men without my father knowing about it. Both of them were better men than Joab. Now the Lord will make him pay for those murders. Shimei, you promised in the name of the Lord that you would never leave Jerusalem. I warned you that you would die if you did. You agreed that this was fair, didn't you? Solomon was now in complete control of his kingdom.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">My son, I will soon die, as everyone must. But I want you to be strong and brave.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Do what the Lord your God commands and follow his teachings. Obey everything written in the Law of Moses. Then you will be a success, no matter what you do or where you go.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">You and your descendants must always faithfully obey the Lord . If you do, he will keep the solemn promise he made to me that someone from our family will always be king of Israel.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Solomon, don't forget what Joab did to me by killing Abner son of Ner and Amasa son of Jether, the two commanders of Israel's army. He killed them as if they were his enemies in a war, but he did it when there was no war. He is guilty, and now it's up to you to punish him</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">in the way you think best. Whatever you do, don't let him die peacefully in his old age.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">The sons of Barzillai from Gilead helped me when I was running from your brother Absalom. Be kind to them and let them eat at your table.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Be sure to do something about Shimei son of Gera from Bahurim in the territory of Benjamin. He cursed and insulted me the day I went to Mahanaim. But later, when he came to meet me at the Jordan River, I promised that I wouldn't kill him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Now you must punish him. He's an old man, but you're wise enough to know that you must have him killed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">His son Solomon became king and took control of David's kingdom.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">One day, Adonijah went to see Bathsheba, Solomon's mother, and she asked, &amp;apos;Is this a friendly visit?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">I just want to talk with you.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">&amp;apos;You know that I was king for a little while,&amp;apos; Adonijah replied. &amp;apos;And everyone in Israel accepted me as their ruler. But the Lord wanted my brother to be king, so now things have changed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Would you do me a favor?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">&amp;apos;Please ask Solomon to let me marry Abishag. He won't say no to you.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">&amp;apos;All right,&amp;apos; she said. &amp;apos;I'll ask him.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">When Bathsheba went to see Solomon, he stood up to meet her, then bowed low. He sat back down and had another throne brought in, so his mother could sit at his right side.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Bathsheba sat down and then asked, &amp;apos;Would you do me a small favor?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">&amp;apos;Allow your brother Adonijah to marry Abishag,&amp;apos; she answered.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Solomon said: What? Let my older brother marry Abishag? You may as well ask me to let him rule the kingdom! And why don't you ask such favors for Abiathar and Joab? And so the promise that the Lord had made at Shiloh about the family of Eli came true. Joab sent back his answer, &amp;apos;I was afraid of you, and I ran to the Lord for protection.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">I swear in the name of the Lord that Adonijah will die because he asked for this! If he doesn't, I pray that God will severely punish me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">The Lord made me king in my father's place and promised that the kings of Israel would come from my family. Yes, I swear by the living Lord that Adonijah will die today.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">&amp;apos;Benaiah,&amp;apos; Solomon shouted, &amp;apos;go kill Adonijah.&amp;apos; So Adonijah died.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">Solomon sent for Abiathar the priest and said:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">But I won't let you be a priest of the Lord anymore.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">Joab had not helped Absalom try to become king, but he had helped Adonijah. So when Joab learned that Adonijah had been killed, he ran to the sacred tent and grabbed hold of the corners of the altar for protection.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">When Solomon heard about this, he sent someone to ask Joab, &amp;apos;Why did you run to the altar?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">Benaiah went to the sacred tent and yelled, &amp;apos;Joab, the king orders you to come out!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">Joab's family will always suffer because of what he did, but the Lord will always bless David's family and his kingdom with peace.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">Benaiah went back and killed Joab. His body was taken away and buried near his home in the desert.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">Solomon put Benaiah in Joab's place as army commander, and he put Zadok in Abiathar's place as priest.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">Solomon sent for Shimei and said, &amp;apos;Build a house here in Jerusalem and live in it. But whatever you do, don't leave the city!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">If you ever cross Kidron Valley and leave Jerusalem, you will be killed. And it will be your own fault.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">&amp;apos;That's fair, Your Majesty,&amp;apos; Shimei answered. &amp;apos;I'll do that.&amp;apos; So Shimei lived in Jerusalem from then on.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">About three years later, two of Shimei's servants ran off to King Achish in Gath. When Shimei found out where they were,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">he saddled his donkey and went after them. He found them and brought them back to Jerusalem.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">Someone told Solomon that Shimei had gone to Gath and was back.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">Solomon sent for him and said:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43">You have disobeyed me and have broken the promise you made to the Lord .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44">I know you remember all the cruel things you did to my father David. Now the Lord is going to punish you for what you did.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45">But the Lord will bless me and make my father's kingdom strong forever.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46">&amp;apos;Benaiah,&amp;apos; Solomon shouted, &amp;apos;kill Shimei.&amp;apos; So Shimei died.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="3">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Solomon signed a treaty with the king of Egypt and married his daughter. She lived in the older part of Jerusalem until the palace, the Lord 's temple, and the wall around Jerusalem were completed. My father David, your servant, was honest and did what you commanded. You were always loyal to him, and you gave him a son who is now king. Solomon, I'm pleased that you asked for this. You could have asked to live a long time or to be rich. Or you could have asked for your enemies to be destroyed. Instead, you asked for wisdom to make right decisions. Your Majesty, this woman and I live in the same house. Not long ago my baby was born at home, &amp;apos;The dead baby is yours,&amp;apos; the first woman yelled. &amp;apos;Mine is alive!&amp;apos; They argued back and forth in front of Solomon, A sword was brought, and Solomon ordered, The other woman shouted, &amp;apos;Go ahead and cut him in half. Then neither of us will have the baby.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">At that time, there was no temple for worshiping the Lord , and everyone offered sacrifices at the local shrines.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Solomon loved the Lord and followed his father David's instructions, but Solomon also offered sacrifices and burned incense at the shrines.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">The most important shrine was in Gibeon, and Solomon had offered more than 1,000 sacrifices on that altar.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">One night while Solomon was in Gibeon, the Lord God appeared to him in a dream and said, &amp;apos;Solomon, ask for anything you want, and I will give it to you.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Solomon answered:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Lord God, I'm your servant, and you've made me king in my father's place. But I'm very young and know so little about being a leader.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">And now I must rule your chosen people, even though there are too many of them to count.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Please make me wise and teach me the difference between right and wrong. Then I will know how to rule your people. If you don't, there is no way I could rule this great nation of yours.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">So I'll make you wiser than anyone who has ever lived or ever will live.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">I'll also give you what you didn't ask for. You'll be rich and respected as long as you live, and you'll be greater than any other king.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">If you obey me and follow my commands, as your father David did, I'll let you live a long time.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Solomon woke up and realized that God had spoken to him in the dream. He went back to Jerusalem and stood in front of the sacred chest, where he offered sacrifices to please the Lord and sacrifices to ask his blessing. Then Solomon gave a feast for his officials.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">One day two women came to King Solomon,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">and one of them said:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">and three days later her baby was born. Nobody else was there with us.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">One night while we were all asleep, she rolled over on her baby, and he died.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Then while I was still asleep, she got up and took my son out of my bed. She put him in her bed, then she put her dead baby next to me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">In the morning when I got up to feed my son, I saw that he was dead. But when I looked at him in the light, I knew he wasn't my son.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">&amp;apos;No!&amp;apos; the other woman shouted. &amp;apos;He was your son. My baby is alive!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">until finally he said, &amp;apos;Both of you say this live baby is yours.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">Someone bring me a sword.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">&amp;apos;Cut the baby in half! That way each of you can have part of him.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">&amp;apos;Please don't kill my son,&amp;apos; the baby's mother screamed. &amp;apos;Your Majesty, I love him very much, but give him to her. Just don't kill him.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">Solomon said, &amp;apos;Don't kill the baby.&amp;apos; Then he pointed to the first woman, &amp;apos;She is his real mother. Give the baby to her.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">Everyone in Israel was amazed when they heard how Solomon had made his decision. They realized that God had given him wisdom to judge fairly.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="3">Remember how my father David wanted to build a temple where the Lord his God could be worshiped? But enemies kept attacking my father's kingdom, and he never had the chance.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Now, thanks to the Lord God, there is peace in my kingdom and no trouble or threat of war anywhere.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">The Lord God promised my father that when his son became king, he would build a temple for worshiping the Lord . So I've decided to do that.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">I'd like you to send your workers to cut down cedar trees in Lebanon for me. I will pay them whatever you say and will even have my workers help them. We both know that your workers are more experienced than anyone else at cutting lumber.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Hiram was so happy when he heard Solomon's request that he said, &amp;apos;I am grateful that the Lord gave David such a wise son to be king of that great nation!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Then he sent back his answer:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">My workers will carry them down from Lebanon to the Mediterranean Sea. They will tie the logs together and float them along the coast to wherever you want them. Then they will untie the logs, and your workers can take them from there.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Hiram gave Solomon all the cedar and pine logs he needed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">In return, Solomon gave Hiram over 2,000 tons of wheat and almost 4,000 liters of pure olive oil each year.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">The Lord kept his promise and made Solomon wise. Hiram and Solomon signed a treaty and never went to war against each other.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Solomon ordered 30,000 people from all over Israel to cut logs for the temple,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">and he put Adoniram in charge of these workers. Solomon divided them into three groups of 10,000. Each group worked one month in Lebanon and had two months off at home.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">He also had 80,000 workers to cut stone in the hill country of Israel, 70,000 workers to carry the stones,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">and over 3,000 assistants to keep track of the work and to supervise the workers.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1">Solomon's palace took 13 years to build. King Solomon asked Hiram to come to Jerusalem and make the bronze furnishings to use for worship in the Lord 's temple, and he agreed to do it. This completed the work on the columns. The side panels of the stands were square, This is a list of the bronze items that Hiram made for the Lord 's temple: Hiram made these bronze things for Solomon</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="7">Solomon's throne was in Justice Hall, where he judged cases. This hall was completely lined with cedar.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">The section of the palace where Solomon lived was behind Justice Hall and looked exactly like it. He had a similar place built for his wife, the daughter of the king of Egypt.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">From the foundation all the way to the top, these buildings and the courtyard were made out of the best stones carefully cut to size, then smoothed on every side with saws.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">The foundation stones were huge, good stones&amp;ndash;some of them four and a half meters long and others three and a half meters long.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="15">Hiram made two bronze columns eight meters tall and almost two meters across.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="26">The sides of the bowl were 75 millimeters thick, and its rim was like a cup that curved outward like flower petals. The bowl held about 40,000 liters.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">Hiram made ten movable bronze stands, each one over a meter high, almost two meters long, and almost two meters wide.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">and the wheels and axles were underneath them. The wheels were about 68 centimeters high</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">and looked like chariot wheels. The axles, rims, spokes, and hubs were made out of bronze.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="37">Hiram made the ten bronze stands from the same mold, so they were exactly the same size and shape.</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="8">
			<VERS vnumber="5">Solomon and a crowd of people stood in front of the chest and sacrificed more sheep and cattle than could be counted.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">The priests carried the chest into the most holy place and put it under the winged creatures,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">whose wings covered both the chest and the poles used for carrying it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">The poles were so long that they could be seen from right outside the most holy place, but not from anywhere else. And they stayed there from then on.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">The only things kept in the chest were the two flat stones Moses had put there when the Lord made his agreement with the people of Israel at Mount Sinai, after bringing them out of Egypt.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Suddenly a cloud filled the temple as the priests were leaving the most holy place.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">The Lord 's glory was in the cloud, and the light from it was so bright that the priests could not stay inside to do their work.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Then Solomon prayed:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Now I have built a glorious temple</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Solomon turned toward the people standing there. Then he blessed them</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">So when David wanted to build a temple for the Lord God of Israel,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">the Lord said, &amp;apos;It's good that you want to build a temple where I can be worshiped.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">But you're not the one to do it. Your son will build a temple to honor me.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">The Lord has done what he promised. I am the king of Israel like my father, and I've built a temple for the Lord our God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">I've also made a place in the temple for the sacred chest. And in that chest are the two flat stones on which is written the solemn agreement the Lord made with our ancestors when he led them out of Egypt.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Solomon stood facing the altar with everyone standing behind him. Then he lifted his arms toward heaven</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">and prayed:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">My father David was your servant, and today you have kept every promise you made to him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">Lord God of Israel, you promised my father that someone from his family would always be king of Israel, if they do their best to obey you, just as he did.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">Please keep this promise you made to your servant David.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">There's not enough room in all of heaven for you, Lord God. How could you possibly live on earth in this temple I have built?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">But I ask you to answer my prayer.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">This is the temple where you have chosen to be worshiped. Please watch over it day and night and listen when I turn toward it and pray.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">I am your servant, and the people of Israel belong to you. So whenever any of us look toward this temple and pray, answer from your home in heaven and forgive our sins.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">Suppose someone accuses a person of a crime, and the accused has to stand in front of the altar in your temple and say, &amp;apos;I swear I am innocent!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">Listen from heaven and decide who is right. Then punish the guilty person and let the innocent one go free.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">Suppose your people Israel sin against you, and then an enemy defeats them. If they come to this temple and beg for forgiveness,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">listen from your home in heaven. Forgive them and bring them back to the land you gave their ancestors.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">Suppose your people sin against you, and you punish them by holding back the rain. If they turn toward this temple and pray in your name and stop sinning,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">listen from your home in heaven and forgive them. The people of Israel are your servants, so teach them to live right. And please send rain on the land you gave them to be theirs forever.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">Sometimes the crops may dry up or rot or be eaten by locusts or grasshoppers, and your people will be starving. Sometimes enemies may surround their towns, or your people will become sick with deadly diseases.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">Listen when anyone in Israel truly feels sorry and sincerely prays with arms lifted toward your temple.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">You know what is in everyone's heart. So from your home in heaven answer their prayers, according to the way they live and what is in their hearts.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">Then your people will worship and obey you for as long as they live in the land you gave their ancestors.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43">listen from your home in heaven and answer their prayers. Then everyone on earth will worship you, just like your people Israel, and they will know that I have built this temple to honor you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44">Our Lord , sometimes you will order your people to attack their enemies. Then your people will turn toward this temple I have built for you in your chosen city, and they will pray to you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45">Answer their prayers from heaven and give them victory.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46">Everyone sins. But when your people sin against you, suppose you get angry enough to let their enemies drag them away to foreign countries.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="50">Forgive your people no matter how much they have sinned against you. Make the enemies who defeated them be kind to them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="51">Remember, they are the people you chose and rescued from Egypt that was like a blazing fire to them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="52">I am your servant, and the people of Israel belong to you. So listen when any of us pray and cry out for your help.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="53">When you brought our ancestors out of Egypt, you told your servant Moses to say to them, &amp;apos;From all people on earth, the Lord God has chosen you to be his very own.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="54">When Solomon finished his prayer at the altar, he was kneeling with his arms lifted toward heaven. He stood up,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="55">turned toward the people, blessed them, and said loudly:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="56">Praise the Lord ! He has kept his promise and given us peace. Every good thing he promised to his servant Moses has happened.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="57">The Lord our God was with our ancestors to help them, and I pray that he will be with us and never abandon us.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="58">May the Lord help us obey him and follow all the laws and teachings he gave our ancestors.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="59">I pray that the Lord our God will remember my prayer day and night. May he help everyone in Israel each day, in whatever way we need it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="60">Then every nation will know that the Lord is the only true God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="61">Obey the Lord our God and follow his commands with all your heart, just as you are doing today.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="64">On that day, Solomon dedicated the courtyard in front of the temple and made it acceptable for worship. He offered the sacrifices there because the bronze altar in front of the temple was too small.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="65">Solomon and the huge crowd celebrated the Festival of Shelters at the temple for seven days. There were people from as far away as the Egyptian Gorge in the south and Lebo-Hamath in the north.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="66">Then on the eighth day, he sent everyone home. They said goodbye and left, very happy, because of all the good things the Lord had done for his servant David and his people Israel.</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="9">
			<VERS vnumber="1">The Lord 's temple and Solomon's palace were now finished, and Solomon had built everything he wanted.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Some time later the Lord appeared to him again in a dream, just as he had done at Gibeon.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">The Lord said: I heard your prayer and what you asked me to do. This temple you have built is where I will be worshiped forever. It belongs to me, and I will never stop watching over it. Solomon ordered his workers to rebuild Lower Beth-Horon, Solomon had now finished building the Lord 's temple.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">You must obey me, as your father David did, and be honest and fair. Obey my laws and teachings,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">and I will keep my promise to David that someone from your family will always be king of Israel.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">But if you or any of your descendants disobey my commands or start worshiping foreign gods,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">I will no longer let my people Israel live in this land I gave them. I will desert this temple where I said I would be worshiped. Then people everywhere will think this nation is only a joke and will make fun of it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">This temple will become a pile of rocks! Everyone who walks by will be shocked, and they will ask, &amp;apos;Why did the Lord do such a terrible thing to his people and to this temple?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Then they will answer, &amp;apos;We know why the Lord did this. The people of Israel rejected the Lord their God, who rescued their ancestors from Egypt, and they started worshiping other gods.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">It took 20 years for the Lord 's temple and Solomon's palace to be built.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Later, Solomon gave King Hiram of Tyre 20 towns in the region of Galilee to repay him for the cedar, pine, and gold he had given Solomon.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">When Hiram went to see the towns, he did not like them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">He said, &amp;apos;Solomon, my friend, are these the kind of towns you want to give me?&amp;apos; So Hiram called the region Cabul because he thought it was worthless.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">He sent Solomon only five tons of gold in return.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">After Solomon's workers had finished the temple and the palace, he ordered them to fill in the land on the east side of Jerusalem, to build a wall around the city, and to rebuild the towns of Hazor, Megiddo, and Gezer.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Earlier, the king of Egypt had captured the town of Gezer; he burned it to the ground and killed the Canaanite people living there. Then he gave it to his daughter as a wedding present when she married Solomon.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">So Solomon had the town rebuilt.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Baalath, and Tamar in the desert of Judah.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">They also built towns where he could keep his supplies and his chariots and horses. Solomon ordered them to build whatever he wanted in Jerusalem, Lebanon, and anywhere in his kingdom.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">Solomon appointed 550 officers to be in charge of his workers and to watch over his building projects.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">Solomon's wife, the daughter of the king of Egypt, moved from the older part of Jerusalem to her new palace. Then Solomon had the land on the east side of Jerusalem filled in.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">Three times a year, Solomon burned incense and offered sacrifices to the Lord on the altar he had built.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">He also had a lot of ships at Ezion-Geber, a town in Edom near Eloth on the Red Sea.</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="10">
			<VERS vnumber="1">The Queen of Sheba heard how famous Solomon was, so she went to Jerusalem to test him with difficult questions.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">She took along several of her officials, and she loaded her camels with gifts of spices, jewels, and gold. When she arrived, she and Solomon talked about everything she could think of.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">He answered every question, no matter how difficult it was. Solomon, in my own country I had heard about your wisdom and all you've done.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">She said:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">But I didn't believe it until I saw it with my own eyes! And there's so much I didn't hear about. You are wiser and richer than I was told.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Your wives and officials are lucky to be here where they can listen to the wise things you say.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">I praise the Lord your God. He is pleased with you and has made you king of Israel. The Lord has always loved Israel, so he has given them a king who will rule fairly and honestly.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">The Queen of Sheba gave Solomon more than four tons of gold, many jewels, and more spices than anyone had ever brought into Israel.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Solomon received almost 23 tons of gold a year.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">The merchants and traders, as well as the kings of Arabia and rulers from Israel, also gave him gold.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Solomon made 200 gold shields and used almost seven kilograms of gold for each one.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="18">His throne was made of ivory and covered with pure gold.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Since silver was almost worthless in those days, everything was made of gold, even the cups and dishes used in Forest Hall.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Solomon had a lot of seagoing ships. Every three years he sent them out with Hiram's ships to bring back gold, silver, and ivory, as well as monkeys and peacocks.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">He was the richest and wisest king in the world.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">People from every nation wanted to hear the wisdom God had given him.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="6">Solomon's father had obeyed the Lord with all his heart, but Solomon disobeyed and did what the Lord hated.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Solomon built shrines on a hill east of Jerusalem to worship Chemosh the disgusting god of Moab, and Molech the disgusting god of Ammon.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">In fact, he built a shrine for each of his foreign wives, so all of them could burn incense and offer sacrifices to their own gods.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">and he said to Solomon:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">But because David was your father, you will remain king as long as you live. I will wait until your son becomes king, then I will take the kingdom from him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">When I do, I will still let him rule one tribe, because I have not forgotten that David was my servant and Jerusalem is my chosen city.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Hadad was from the royal family of Edom, and here is how the Lord made him Solomon's enemy:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Hadad and his wife had a son named Genubath, and the queen let the boy grow up in the palace with her own children.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">When Hadad heard that David and Joab were dead, he said to the king, &amp;apos;Your Majesty, please let me go back to my own country.&amp;apos;</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="23">Here is how God made Rezon son of Eliada an enemy of Solomon:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">Jeroboam was from the town of Zeredah in Ephraim. His father Nebat had died, but his mother Zeruah was still alive. Jeroboam was one of Solomon's officials, but even he rebelled against Solomon.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">Here is how it happened: While Solomon's workers were filling in the land on the east side of Jerusalem and repairing the city walls,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">Solomon noticed that Jeroboam was a hard worker. So he put Jeroboam in charge of the work force from Manasseh and Ephraim.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">Then he said:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">But Solomon will still rule one tribe, since he is the son of David my servant, and Jerusalem is my chosen city.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">&amp;apos;Solomon and the Israelites are not like their ancestor David. They will not listen to me, obey me, or do what is right. They have turned from me to worship Astarte the goddess of Sidon, Chemosh the god of Moab, and Milcom the god of Ammon.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">&amp;apos;Solomon is David's son, and David was my chosen leader, who did what I commanded. So I will let Solomon be king until he dies.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">Then I will give you ten tribes to rule,</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="38">I'll help you if you obey me. And if you do what I say, as my servant David did, I will always let someone from your family rule in Israel, just as someone from David's family will always rule in Judah. The nation of Israel will be yours.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1">Rehoboam went to Shechem where everyone was waiting to crown him king. So the people from the northern tribes of Israel went home, leaving Rehoboam to rule only the people from the towns in Judah. Ever since that day, the people of Israel have opposed David's family in Judah. All of this happened just as the Lord 's prophet Ahijah had told Jeroboam. Rehoboam and his army obeyed the Lord and went home.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Jeroboam son of Nebat heard what was happening, and he stayed in Egypt, where he had gone to hide from Solomon.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">But the people from the northern tribes of Israel sent for him. Then together they went to Rehoboam and said,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">&amp;apos;Your father Solomon forced us to work very hard. But if you make our work easier, we will serve you and do whatever you ask.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">&amp;apos;Give me three days to think about it,&amp;apos; Rehoboam replied, &amp;apos;then come back for my answer.&amp;apos; So the people left.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Rehoboam went to some leaders who had been his father's senior officials, and he asked them, &amp;apos;What should I tell these people?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">They answered, &amp;apos;If you want them to serve and obey you, then you should do what they ask today. Tell them you will make their work easier.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">But Rehoboam refused their advice and went to the younger men who had grown up with him and were now his officials.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">He asked, &amp;apos;What do you think I should say to these people who asked me to make their work easier?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">His younger advisors said: Here's what we think you should say to them: &amp;apos;Compared to me, my father was weak. Adoniram was in charge of the forced labor, and Rehoboam sent him to talk to the people. But they stoned him to death. Then Rehoboam ran to his chariot and hurried back to Jerusalem.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">He made you work hard, but I'll make you work even harder. He punished you with whips, but I'll use whips with pieces of sharp metal!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Three days later, Jeroboam and the others came back.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Rehoboam ignored the advice of the older advisors.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">He spoke bluntly and told them exactly what his own advisors had suggested: &amp;apos;My father made you work hard, but I'll make you work even harder. He punished you with whips, but I'll use whips with pieces of sharp metal!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">When the Israelites heard that Jeroboam was back, they called everyone together. Then they sent for Jeroboam and made him king of Israel. Only the people from the tribe of Judah remained loyal to David's family.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">After Rehoboam returned to Jerusalem, he decided to attack Israel and take control of the whole country. So he called together 180,000 soldiers from the tribes of Judah and Benjamin.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Meanwhile, God told Shemaiah the prophet</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">to give Rehoboam and everyone from Judah and Benjamin this warning:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">&amp;apos;Don't go to war against the people from Israel&amp;ndash;they are your relatives. Go home! I am the Lord , and I made these things happen.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">Jeroboam rebuilt Shechem in Ephraim and made it a stronger town, then he moved there. He also fortified the town of Penuel.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">Jeroboam asked for advice and then made two gold statues of calves. He showed them to the people and said, &amp;apos;Listen everyone! You won't have to go to Jerusalem to worship anymore. Here are your gods who rescued you from Egypt.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">Then he put one of the gold calves in the town of Bethel and the other in the town of Dan.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">The people sinned because they started going to these places to worship.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">Jeroboam built small places of worship at the shrines and appointed men who were not from the tribe of Levi to serve as priests.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="13">
			<VERS vnumber="3">You will know that the Lord has said these things when the altar splits in half, and the ashes on it fall to the ground.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Jeroboam pointed at the prophet and shouted, &amp;apos;Grab him!&amp;apos; But at once, Jeroboam's hand became stiff, and he could not move it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">The altar split in half, and the ashes fell to the ground, just as the prophet had warned.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">&amp;apos;Please pray to the Lord your God and ask him to heal my hand,&amp;apos; Jeroboam begged.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">&amp;apos;Come home with me and eat something,&amp;apos; Jeroboam said. &amp;apos;I want to give you a gift for what you have done.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">&amp;apos;No, I wouldn't go with you, even if you offered me half of your kingdom. I won't eat or drink here either.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">The Lord said I can't eat or drink anything and that I can't go home the same way I came.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Then he started home down a different road.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">At that time an old prophet lived in Bethel, and one of his sons told him what the prophet from Judah had said and done.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">&amp;apos;Show me which way he went,&amp;apos; the old prophet said, and his sons pointed out the road.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">&amp;apos;Put a saddle on my donkey,&amp;apos; he told them. After they did, he got on the donkey</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">and rode off to look for the prophet from Judah.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">&amp;apos;Come home with me,&amp;apos; the old prophet said, &amp;apos;and have something to eat.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">&amp;apos;I can't go back with you,&amp;apos; the prophet replied, &amp;apos;and I can't eat or drink anything with you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">The Lord warned me not to eat or drink or to go home the same way I came.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">The old prophet said, &amp;apos;I'm a prophet too. One of the Lord 's angels told me to take you to my house and give you something to eat and drink.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">so he went home with him and ate and drank.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">During the meal the Lord gave the old prophet</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">a message for the prophet from Judah:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">He told you not to eat or drink anything here, but you came home and ate with me. And so, when you die, your body won't be buried in your family tomb.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">After the meal the old prophet got a donkey ready,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">and the prophet from Judah left. Along the way, a lion attacked and killed him, and the donkey and the lion stood there beside his dead body.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">Some people walked by and saw the body with the lion standing there. They ran into Bethel, telling everyone what they had seen.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">When the old prophet heard the news, he said, &amp;apos;That must be the prophet from Judah. The Lord warned him, but he disobeyed. So the Lord sent a lion to kill him.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">The old prophet told his sons to saddle his donkey, and when it was ready,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">he left. He found the body lying on the road, with the donkey and lion standing there. The lion had not eaten the body or attacked the donkey.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">The old prophet picked up the body, put it on his own donkey, and took it back to Bethel, so he could bury it and mourn for the prophet from Judah.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">He buried the body in his own family tomb and cried for the prophet.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">He said to his sons, &amp;apos;When I die, bury my body next to this prophet.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">I'm sure that everything he said about the altar in Bethel and the shrines in Samaria will happen.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">But Jeroboam kept on doing evil things. He appointed men to be priests at the local shrines, even if they were not Levites. In fact, anyone who wanted to be a priest could be one.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">This sinful thing led to the downfall of his kingdom.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="14">
			<VERS vnumber="1">About the same time, Abijah son of Jeroboam got sick.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">She got ready and left for Ahijah's house in Shiloh.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">but the Lord told him, &amp;apos;Jeroboam's wife is coming to ask about her son. I will tell you what to say to her.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">But when Ahijah heard her walking up to the door, he said:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Give your husband this message from the Lord God of Israel: &amp;apos;Jeroboam, you know that I, the Lord , chose you over anyone else to be the leader of my people Israel.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">I even took David's kingdom away from his family and gave it to you. But you are not like my servant David. He always obeyed me and did what was right.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">&amp;apos;You have made me very angry by rejecting me and making idols out of gold. Jeroboam, you have done more evil things than any king before you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">&amp;apos;Because of this, I will destroy your family by killing every man and boy in it, whether slave or free. I will wipe out your family, just as fire burns up trash.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Dogs will eat the bodies of your relatives who die in town, and vultures will eat the bodies of those who die in the country. I, the Lord , have spoken and will not change my mind!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">That's the Lord 's message to your husband. As for you, go back home, and right after you get there, your son will die.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Everyone in Israel will mourn at his funeral. But he will be the last one from Jeroboam's family to receive a proper burial, because he's the only one the Lord God of Israel is pleased with.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">The Lord will soon choose a new king of Israel, who will destroy Jeroboam's family. And I mean very soon.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">The people of Israel have made the Lord angry by setting up sacred poles for worshiping the goddess Asherah. So the Lord will punish them until they shake like grass in a stream. He will take them out of the land he gave to their ancestors, then scatter them as far away as the Euphrates River.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Jeroboam sinned and caused the Israelites to sin. Now the Lord will desert Israel.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Jeroboam's wife left and went back home to the town of Tirzah. As soon as she set foot in her house, her son died.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="22">The people of Judah disobeyed the Lord and made him even angrier than their ancestors had.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">They also built their own local shrines and stone images of foreign gods, and they set up sacred poles for worshiping the goddess Asherah on every hill and in the shade of large trees.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="26">He took everything of value from the temple and the palace, including Solomon's gold shields.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="22">Then Elijah continued:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">Bring us two bulls. Baal's prophets can take one of them, kill it, and cut it into pieces. Then they can put the meat on the wood without lighting the fire. I will do the same thing with the other bull, and I won't light a fire under it either.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">The prophets of Baal will pray to their god, and I will pray to the Lord . The one who answers by starting the fire is God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">Elijah said to Baal's prophets, &amp;apos;There are more of you, so you go first. Pick out a bull and get it ready, but don't light the fire. Then pray to your god.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">They chose their bull, then they got it ready and prayed to Baal all morning, asking him to start the fire. They danced around the altar and shouted, &amp;apos;Answer us, Baal!&amp;apos; But there was no answer.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">At noon, Elijah began making fun of them. &amp;apos;Pray louder!&amp;apos; he said. &amp;apos;Baal must be a god. Maybe he's daydreaming or using the toilet or traveling somewhere. Or maybe he's asleep, and you have to wake him up.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">The prophets kept shouting louder and louder, and they cut themselves with swords and knives until they were bleeding. This was the way they worshiped,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">and they kept it up until time for the evening sacrifice. But there was no answer of any kind.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">Elijah told everyone to gather around him while he repaired the Lord 's altar.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">He placed the wood on the altar, then they cut the bull into pieces and laid the meat on the wood.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">he told them to do it two more times. They did exactly as he said</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">until finally, the water ran down the altar and filled the ditch.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">When it was time for the evening sacrifice, Elijah prayed: Our Lord , you are the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel. Now, prove that you are the God of this nation, and that I, your servant, have done this at your command.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">Please answer me, so these people will know that you are the Lord God, and that you will turn their hearts back to you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">The Lord immediately sent fire, and it burned up the sacrifice, the wood, and the stones. It scorched the ground everywhere around the altar and dried up every drop of water in the ditch.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">When the crowd saw what had happened, they all bowed down and shouted, &amp;apos;The Lord is God! The Lord is God!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">Just then, Elijah said, &amp;apos;Grab the prophets of Baal! Don't let any of them get away.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">Elijah told Ahab, &amp;apos;Get something to eat and drink. I hear a heavy rain coming.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">Ahab left, but Elijah climbed back to the top of Mount Carmel. Then he stooped down with his face almost to the ground</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43">and said to his servant, &amp;apos;Look toward the sea.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44">After the seventh time the servant replied, &amp;apos;I see a small cloud coming this way. But it's no bigger than a fist.&amp;apos;</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1">Ahab told his wife Jezebel what Elijah had done and that he had killed the prophets.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">She sent a message to Elijah: &amp;apos;You killed my prophets. Now I'm going to kill you! I pray that the gods will punish me even more severely if I don't do it by this time tomorrow.&amp;apos; Suddenly an angel woke him up and said, &amp;apos;Get up and eat.&amp;apos; While Elijah was on Mount Sinai, the Lord asked, &amp;apos;Elijah, why are you here?&amp;apos; All at once, a strong wind shook the mountain and shattered the rocks. But the Lord was not in the wind. Next, there was an earthquake, but the Lord was not in the earthquake. A voice asked, &amp;apos;Elijah, why are you here?&amp;apos; &amp;apos;You can go,&amp;apos; Elijah said. &amp;apos;But remember what I've done for you.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Elijah was afraid when he got her message, and he ran to the town of Beersheba in Judah. He left his servant there,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">then walked another whole day into the desert. Finally, he came to a large bush and sat down in its shade. He begged the Lord , &amp;apos;I've had enough. Just let me die! I'm no better off than my ancestors.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Then he lay down in the shade and fell asleep.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Elijah looked around, and by his head was a jar of water and some baked bread. He sat up, ate and drank, then lay down and went back to sleep.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="19">Elijah left and found Elisha plowing a field with a pair of oxen. There were eleven other men in front of him, and each one was also plowing with a pair of oxen. Elijah went over and put his own coat on Elisha.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Elisha stopped plowing and ran after him. &amp;apos;Let me kiss my parents goodbye, then I'll go with you,&amp;apos; he said.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Elisha left and took his oxen with him. He killed them and boiled them over a fire he had made with the wood from his plow. He gave the meat to the people who were with him, and they ate it. Then he left with Elijah and became his assistant.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1">King Benhadad of Syria called his army together. He was joined by 32 other kings with their horses and chariots, and together they marched to Samaria and attacked.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Benhadad sent a messenger to tell King Ahab of Israel,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">&amp;apos;Ahab, give me your silver and gold, your wives, and your strongest sons!&amp;apos; When Benhadad got his answer, The prophet answered, &amp;apos;The young bodyguards who serve the district officials.&amp;apos; &amp;apos;But who will lead them into battle?&amp;apos; Ahab asked. &amp;apos;You will!&amp;apos; the prophet replied. King Benhadad of Syria and the 32 kings with him were drunk when the scouts he had sent out ran up to his tent, shouting, &amp;apos;We just now saw soldiers marching out of Samaria!&amp;apos; Ahab and Israel's army crushed the Syrians. Israel's gods are mountain gods. We fought Israel's army in the hills, and that's why they defeated us. But if we fight them on flat land, there's no way we can lose. Benhadad agreed and did what they suggested. Benhadad also escaped to Aphek and hid in the back room of a house. &amp;apos;Is he still alive?&amp;apos; Ahab asked. &amp;apos;Benhadad is like a brother to me.&amp;apos; &amp;apos;Go get him,&amp;apos; Ahab said. When Benhadad came out, Ahab had him climb up into his chariot. Ahab replied, &amp;apos;If you do these things, I'll let you go free.&amp;apos; Then they signed a peace treaty, and Ahab let Benhadad go. Ahab answered, &amp;apos;You will be punished just as you have said.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">&amp;apos;Your Majesty,&amp;apos; Ahab replied, &amp;apos;everything I have is yours, including me.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Later, Benhadad sent another messenger to say to Ahab, &amp;apos;I already told you to give me your silver and gold, your wives, and your children.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">But tomorrow at this time, I will send my officials into your city to search your palace and the houses of your officials. They will take everything else that you own.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Ahab called a meeting with the leaders of Israel and said, &amp;apos;Benhadad is causing real trouble. He told me to give him my wives and children, as well as my silver and gold. And I agreed.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">&amp;apos;Don't listen to him!&amp;apos; they answered. &amp;apos;You don't have to do what he says.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">So Ahab sent someone to tell Benhadad, &amp;apos;Your Majesty, I'll give you my silver and gold, and even my wives and children. But I won't let you have anything else.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">he replied, &amp;apos;I'll completely destroy Samaria! There won't even be enough of it left for my soldiers to carry back in their hands. If I don't do it, I pray that the gods will punish me terribly.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Ahab then answered, &amp;apos;Benhadad, don't brag before the fighting even begins. Wait and see if you live through it.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Meanwhile, Benhadad and the other kings had been drinking in their tents. But when Ahab's reply came, he ordered his soldiers to prepare to attack Samaria, and they all got ready.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">At that very moment, a prophet ran up to Ahab and said, &amp;apos;You can see that Benhadad's army is very strong. But the Lord has promised to help you defeat them today. Then you will know that the Lord is in control.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">&amp;apos;Who will fight the battle?&amp;apos; Ahab asked.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">So Ahab called together the 232 young soldiers and the 7,000 troops in Israel's army, and he got them ready to fight the Syrians.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">&amp;apos;Take them alive!&amp;apos; Benhadad ordered. &amp;apos;I don't care if they have come out to fight or to surrender.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">The young soldiers led Israel's troops into battle,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">and each of them attacked and killed an enemy soldier. The rest of the Syrian army turned and ran, and the Israelites went after them. Benhadad and some others escaped on horses,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">but Ahab and his soldiers followed them and captured their horses and chariots.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Later, the prophet went back and warned Ahab, &amp;apos;Benhadad will attack you again next spring. Build up your troops and make sure you have some good plans.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">Meanwhile, Benhadad's officials went to him and explained:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">Here's what you should do. First, get rid of those 32 kings and put army commanders in their places.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">Then get more soldiers, horses, and chariots, so your army will be as strong as it was before. We'll fight Israel's army on flat land and wipe them out.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">In the spring, Benhadad got his army together, and they marched to the town of Aphek to attack Israel.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">The Israelites also prepared to fight. They marched out to meet the Syrians, and the two armies camped across from each other. The Syrians covered the whole area, but the Israelites looked like two little flocks of goats.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">The prophet went to Ahab and said, &amp;apos;The Syrians think the Lord is a god of the hills and not of the valleys. So he has promised to help you defeat their powerful army. Then you will know that the Lord is in control.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">For seven days the two armies stayed in their camps, facing each other. Then on the seventh day the fighting broke out, and before sunset the Israelites had killed 100,000 Syrian troops.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">The rest of the Syrian army ran back to Aphek, but the town wall fell and crushed 27,000 of them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">His officials said, &amp;apos;Your Majesty, we've heard that Israel's kings keep their agreements. We will wrap sackcloth around our waists, put ropes around our heads, and ask Ahab to let you live.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">They dressed in sackcloth and put ropes on their heads, then they went to Ahab and said, &amp;apos;Your servant Benhadad asks you to let him live.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">Benhadad's officials were trying to figure out what Ahab was thinking, and when he said &amp;apos;brother,&amp;apos; they quickly replied, &amp;apos;You're right! You and Benhadad are like brothers.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">Benhadad said, &amp;apos;I'll give back the towns my father took from your father. And you can have shops in Damascus, just as my father had in Samaria.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">About this time the Lord commanded a prophet to say to a friend, &amp;apos;Hit me!&amp;apos; But the friend refused,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">and the prophet told him, &amp;apos;You disobeyed the Lord , and as soon as you walk away, a lion will kill you.&amp;apos; The friend left, and suddenly a lion killed him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">The prophet found someone else and said, &amp;apos;Hit me!&amp;apos; So this man beat him up.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">The prophet left and put a bandage over his face to disguise himself. Then he went and stood beside the road, waiting for Ahab to pass by.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">When Ahab went by, the prophet shouted, &amp;apos;Your Majesty, right in the heat of battle, someone brought a prisoner to me and told me to guard him. He said if the prisoner got away, I would either be killed or forced to pay 3,000 pieces of silver.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">But I got busy doing other things, and the prisoner escaped.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">The man quickly tore the bandage off his face, and Ahab saw that he was one of the prophets.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">The prophet said, &amp;apos;The Lord told you to kill Benhadad, but you let him go. Now you will die in his place, and your people will die in place of his people.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43">Ahab went back to Samaria, angry and depressed.</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="21">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Naboth owned a vineyard in Jezreel near King Ahab's palace. She signed Ahab's name to the letters and sealed them with his seal. Then she sent them to the town leaders. When Elijah found him, Elijah answered: Yes, I did! Ahab, you have managed to do everything the Lord hates. Some time later, the Lord said, &amp;apos;Elijah, do you see how sorry Ahab is for what he did? I won't punish his family while he is still alive. I'll wait until his son is king.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">One day, Ahab said, &amp;apos;Naboth, your vineyard is near my palace. Give it to me so I can turn it into a vegetable garden. I'll give you a better vineyard or pay whatever you want for yours.&amp;apos;</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="5">When the messengers returned to Ahaziah, he asked, &amp;apos;Why are you back so soon?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">&amp;apos;A man met us along the road with a message for you from the Lord ,&amp;apos; they answered. &amp;apos;The Lord wants to know why you sent us to ask Baalzebub about your injury and why you don't believe there's a God in Israel. The man also told us that the Lord says you're going to die.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">&amp;apos;What did the man look like?&amp;apos; Ahaziah asked.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">&amp;apos;He was hairy and had a leather belt around his waist,&amp;apos; they answered.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">So at once he sent an army officer and 50 soldiers to meet Elijah.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">&amp;apos;If I am a man of God,&amp;apos; Elijah answered, &amp;apos;God will send down fire on you and your 50 soldiers.&amp;apos; Fire immediately came down from heaven and burned up the officer and his men.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Ahaziah sent another officer and 50 more soldiers to Elijah. The officer said, &amp;apos;Man of God, the king orders you to come see him at once.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">&amp;apos;If I am a man of God,&amp;apos; Elijah answered, &amp;apos;fire will destroy you and your 50 soldiers.&amp;apos; And God sent down fire from heaven on the officer and his men.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Ahaziah sent a third army officer and 50 more soldiers. This officer went up to Elijah, then he got down on his knees and begged, &amp;apos;Man of God, please be kind to me and these 50 servants of yours. Let us live!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Fire has already wiped out the other officers and their soldiers. Please don't let it happen to me.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">The angel from the Lord said to Elijah, &amp;apos;Go with him and don't be afraid.&amp;apos; So Elijah got up and went with the officer.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">When Elijah arrived, he told Ahaziah, &amp;apos;The Lord wants to know why you sent messengers to Ekron to ask Baalzebub about your injury. Don't you believe there's a God in Israel? Ahaziah, because you did that, the Lord says you will die.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Ahaziah died, just as the Lord had said. But since Ahaziah had no sons, Joram his brother then became king. This happened in the second year that Jehoram son of Jehoshaphat was king of Judah.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Everything else Ahaziah did while he was king is written in The History of the Kings of Israel .</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1">Not long before the Lord took Elijah up into heaven in a strong wind, Elijah and Elisha were leaving Gilgal.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Elijah said to Elisha, &amp;apos;The Lord wants me to go to Bethel, but you must stay here.&amp;apos; Elisha replied, &amp;apos;I swear by the living Lord and by your own life that I will stay with you no matter what!&amp;apos; And he went with Elijah to Bethel. &amp;apos;Yes, I do,&amp;apos; Elisha answered. &amp;apos;But don't remind me of it.&amp;apos; Elisha replied, &amp;apos;I swear by the living Lord and by your own life, that I will stay with you no matter what!&amp;apos; And he went with Elijah to Jericho. &amp;apos;Yes, I do,&amp;apos; Elisha answered. &amp;apos;But don't remind me of it.&amp;apos; Elisha replied, &amp;apos;I swear by the living Lord and by your own life that I will never leave you!&amp;apos; So the two of them walked on together. Elisha answered, &amp;apos;Please give me twice as much of your power as you give the other prophets, so I can be the one who takes your place as their leader.&amp;apos; They walked over to him, bowed down, &amp;apos;No,&amp;apos; Elisha replied, &amp;apos;they won't find him.&amp;apos; They brought him the bowl of salt,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">A group of prophets who lived there asked Elisha, &amp;apos;Do you know that today the Lord is going to take away your master?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Elijah then said, &amp;apos;Elisha, now the Lord wants me to go to Jericho, but you must stay here.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">A group of prophets who lived there asked Elisha, &amp;apos;Do you know that today the Lord is going to take away your master?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Elijah then said to Elisha, &amp;apos;Now the Lord wants me to go to the Jordan River, but you must stay here.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Fifty prophets followed Elijah and Elisha from Jericho, then stood at a distance and watched as the two men walked toward the river.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">When they got there, Elijah took off his coat, then he rolled it up and struck the water with it. At once a path opened up through the river, and the two of them walked across on dry ground.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">After they had reached the other side, Elijah said, &amp;apos;Elisha, the Lord will soon take me away. What can I do for you before that happens?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">&amp;apos;It won't be easy,&amp;apos; Elijah answered. &amp;apos;It can happen only if you see me as I am being taken away.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Elijah and Elisha were walking along and talking, when suddenly there appeared between them a flaming chariot pulled by fiery horses. At once, a strong wind took Elijah up into heaven.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Elisha saw this and shouted, &amp;apos;Israel's cavalry and chariots have taken my master away!&amp;apos; After Elijah had gone, Elisha tore his clothes in sorrow.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Elijah's coat had fallen off, so Elisha picked it up and walked back to the Jordan River.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">He struck the water with the coat and wondered, &amp;apos;Will the Lord perform miracles for me as he did for Elijah?&amp;apos; As soon as Elisha did this, a dry path opened up through the water, and he walked across.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">When the prophets from Jericho saw what happened, they said to each other, &amp;apos;Elisha now has Elijah's power.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">and said, &amp;apos;There are 50 strong men here with us. Please let them go look for your master. Maybe the Spirit of the Lord carried him off to some mountain or valley.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">They kept begging until he was embarrassed to say no. He finally agreed, and the prophets sent the men out. They looked three days for Elijah but never found him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">They returned to Jericho, and Elisha said, &amp;apos;I told you that you wouldn't find him.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">One day the people of Jericho said, &amp;apos;Elisha, you can see that our city is in a good spot. But the water from our spring is so bad that it even keeps our crops from growing.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">He replied, &amp;apos;Put some salt in a new bowl and bring it to me.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">and he carried it to the spring. He threw the salt into the water and said, &amp;apos;The Lord has made this water pure again. From now on you'll be able to grow crops, and no one will starve.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">The water has been fine ever since, just as Elisha said.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">Elisha left and headed toward Bethel. Along the way some boys started making fun of him by shouting, &amp;apos;Go away, baldy! Get out of here!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">Elisha turned around and stared at the boys. Then he cursed them in the name of the Lord . At once two bears ran out of the woods and ripped to pieces 42 of the boys.</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="3">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Joram son of Ahab became king of Israel in Jehoshaphat's eighteenth year as king of Judah. Joram ruled twelve years from Samaria</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">and disobeyed the Lord by doing wrong. He tore down the stone image his father had made to honor Baal, and so he wasn't as sinful as his parents.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">But he kept doing the sinful things that Jeroboam son of Nebat had led Israel to do. &amp;apos;Yes, I will,&amp;apos; Jehoshaphat answered. &amp;apos;I'm on your side, and my soldiers and horses are at your command. &amp;apos;We will march through Edom Desert,&amp;apos; Joram replied. One of Joram's officers answered, &amp;apos;Elisha son of Shaphat is here. He was one of Elijah's closest followers.&amp;apos; The three kings went over to Elisha, &amp;apos;No,&amp;apos; Joram answered. &amp;apos;It was the Lord who led us out here, so that Moab's army could capture us.&amp;apos; The harpist began playing, and the Lord gave Elisha this message for Joram: Finally, the only city left standing was Kir-Hareseth, but soldiers armed with slings surrounded and attacked it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">For many years the country of Moab had been controlled by Israel and was forced to pay taxes to the kings of Israel. King Mesha of Moab raised sheep, so he paid the king of Israel 100,000 lambs and the wool from 100,000 rams.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">But soon after the death of Ahab, Mesha rebelled against Israel.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">One day, Joram left Samaria and called together Israel's army.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">He sent this message to King Jehoshaphat of Judah, &amp;apos;The king of Moab has rebelled. Will you go with me to attack him?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">But which way should we go?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">So Joram, Jehoshaphat, and the king of Edom led their troops out. But seven days later, there was no drinking water left for them or their animals.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Joram cried out, &amp;apos;This is terrible! The Lord must have led us out here to be captured by Moab's army.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Jehoshaphat said, &amp;apos;Which of the Lord 's prophets is with us? We can find out from him what the Lord wants us to do.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Jehoshaphat replied, &amp;apos;He can give us the Lord 's message.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">and he asked Joram, &amp;apos;Why did you come to me? Go talk to the prophets of the foreign gods your parents worshiped.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Elisha said to him, &amp;apos;I serve the Lord All-Powerful, and as surely as he lives, I swear I wouldn't even look at you if I didn't respect King Jehoshaphat.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Then Elisha said, &amp;apos;Send for someone who can play the harp.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">The Lord says that this dry riverbed will be filled with water.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">You won't feel any wind or see any rain, but there will be plenty of water for you and your animals.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="19">You will capture all their walled cities and important towns. You will chop down every good tree and stop up every spring of water, then ruin their fertile fields by covering them with rocks.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">The next morning, while the sacrifice was being offered, water suddenly started flowing from the direction of Edom, and it flooded the land.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Meanwhile, the people of Moab had heard that the three kings were coming to attack them. They had called together all of their fighting men, from the youngest to the oldest, and these troops were now standing at their border, ready for battle.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">When they got up that morning, the sun was shining across the water, making it look red. The Moabite troops took one look</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">and shouted, &amp;apos;Look at that blood! The armies of those kings must have fought and killed each other. Come on, let's go take what's left in their camp.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">But when they arrived at Israel's camp, the Israelite soldiers came out and attacked them, until they turned and ran away. Israel's army chased them all the way back to Moab, and even there they kept up the attack.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">The Israelites destroyed the Moabite towns. They chopped down the good trees and stopped up the springs of water, then covered the fertile fields with rocks.</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="4">
			<VERS vnumber="1">One day the widow of one of the Lord 's prophets said to Elisha, &amp;apos;You know that before my husband died, he was a follower of yours and a worshiper of the Lord . But he owed a man some money, and now that man is on his way to take my two sons as his slaves.&amp;apos; &amp;apos;Sir, I have nothing but a small bottle of olive oil.&amp;apos; Later, when she and her sons were back inside their house, the two sons brought her the jars, and she began filling them. &amp;apos;We don't have any more,&amp;apos; he answered, and the oil stopped flowing from the small bottle. The woman answered, &amp;apos;With my relatives nearby, I have everything I need.&amp;apos; Gehazi replied, &amp;apos;I do know that her husband is old, and that she doesn't have a son.&amp;apos; &amp;apos;You're a man of God,&amp;apos; the woman replied. &amp;apos;Please don't lie to me.&amp;apos; &amp;apos;Carry him back to his mother,&amp;apos; the father said to his servant. &amp;apos;That's all right,&amp;apos; she answered. When Elisha saw her coming, he said, &amp;apos;Gehazi, look! It's the woman from Shunem. &amp;apos;Everything is fine,&amp;apos; she answered Gehazi. Gehazi started toward her to push her away, when Elisha said, &amp;apos;Leave her alone! Don't you see how sad she is? But the Lord hasn't told me why.&amp;apos; One day while the prophets who lived there were meeting with Elisha, he said to his servant, &amp;apos;Prepare a big pot of stew for these prophets.&amp;apos; &amp;apos;Just give it to them,&amp;apos; Elisha replied. &amp;apos;The Lord has promised there will be more than enough.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">&amp;apos;Maybe there's something I can do to help,&amp;apos; Elisha said. &amp;apos;What do you have in your house?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Elisha told her, &amp;apos;Ask your neighbors for their empty jars. And after you've borrowed as many as you can,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">go home and shut the door behind you and your sons. Then begin filling the jars with oil and set each one aside as you fill it.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">The woman left.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">At last, she said to one of her sons, &amp;apos;Bring me another jar.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">After she told Elisha what had happened, he said, &amp;apos;Sell the oil and use part of the money to pay what you owe the man. You and your sons can live on what is left.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Once, while Elisha was in the town of Shunem, he met a rich woman who invited him to her home for dinner. After that, whenever he was in Shunem, he would have a meal there with her and her husband.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Some time later the woman said to her husband, &amp;apos;I'm sure the man who comes here so often is a prophet of God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Why don't we build him a small room on the flat roof of our house? We can put a bed, a table and chair, and an oil lamp in it. Then whenever he comes, he can stay with us.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">The next time Elisha was in Shunem, he stopped at their house and went up to his room to rest.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">&amp;apos;Then what can we do for her?&amp;apos; Elisha asked Gehazi.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">&amp;apos;Ask her to come here again,&amp;apos; Elisha told his servant. He called for her, and she came and stood in the doorway of Elisha's room.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Elisha said to her, &amp;apos;Next year at this time, you'll be holding your own baby son in your arms.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">But a few months later, the woman got pregnant. She gave birth to a son, just as Elisha had promised.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">One day while the boy was still young, he was out in the fields with his father, where the workers were harvesting the crops.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Suddenly he shouted, &amp;apos;My head hurts. It hurts a lot!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">The servant picked up the boy and carried him to his mother. The boy lay on her lap all morning, and by noon he was dead.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">She carried him upstairs to Elisha's room and laid him across the bed. Then she walked out and shut the door behind her.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">The woman called to her husband, &amp;apos;I need to see the prophet. Let me use one of the donkeys. Send a servant along with me, and let me leave now, so I can get back quickly.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">&amp;apos;Why do you need to see him today?&amp;apos; her husband asked. &amp;apos;It's not the Sabbath or time for the New Moon Festival.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">She saddled the donkey and said to her servant, &amp;apos;Let's go. And don't slow down unless I tell you to.&amp;apos;</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="26">Run and meet her. And ask her if everything is all right with her and her family.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">But as soon as she got to the top of the mountain, she went over and grabbed Elisha by the feet.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">The woman said, &amp;apos;Sir, I begged you not to get my hopes up, and I didn't even ask you for a son.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">&amp;apos;Gehazi, get ready and go to her house,&amp;apos; Elisha said. &amp;apos;Take along my walking stick, and when you get there, lay it on the boy's face. Don't stop to talk to anyone, even if they try to talk to you.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">But the boy's mother said to Elisha, &amp;apos;I swear by the living Lord and by your own life that I won't leave without you.&amp;apos; So Elisha got up and went with them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">Gehazi ran on ahead and laid Elisha's walking stick on the boy's face, but the boy didn't move or make a sound. Gehazi ran back to Elisha and said, &amp;apos;The boy didn't wake up.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">Elisha arrived at the woman's house and went straight to his room, where he saw the boy's body on his bed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">He walked in, shut the door, and prayed to the Lord .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">Then he got on the bed and stretched out over the dead body, with his mouth on the boy's mouth, his eyes on his eyes, and his hand on his hands. As he lay there, the boy's body became warm.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">Elisha got up and walked back and forth in the room, then he went back and leaned over the boy's body. The boy sneezed seven times and opened his eyes.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">Elisha called out to Gehazi, &amp;apos;Ask the boy's mother to come here.&amp;apos; Gehazi did, and when she was at the door, Elisha said, &amp;apos;You can take your son.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">She came in and bowed down at Elisha's feet. Then she picked up her son and left.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">Later, Elisha went back to Gilgal, where there was almost nothing to eat, because the crops had failed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">One of them went out into the woods to gather some herbs. He found a wild vine and picked as much of its fruit as he could carry, but he didn't know that the fruit was very sour. When he got back, he cut up the fruit and put it in the stew.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">The stew was served, and when the prophets started eating it, they shouted, &amp;apos;Elisha, this stew tastes terrible! We can't eat it.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">&amp;apos;Bring me some flour,&amp;apos; Elisha said. He sprinkled the flour in the stew and said, &amp;apos;Now serve it to them.&amp;apos; And the stew tasted fine.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">A man from the town of Baal-Shalishah brought Elisha some freshly cut grain and 20 loaves of bread made from the first barley that was harvested. Elisha said, &amp;apos;Give it to the people so they can eat.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43">&amp;apos;There's not enough here for 100 people,&amp;apos; his servant said.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1">Naaman was the commander of the Syrian army. The Lord had helped him and his troops defeat their enemies, so the king of Syria respected Naaman very much. Naaman was a brave soldier, but he had leprosy. Naaman left and took along 30,000 pieces of silver, 6,000 pieces of gold, and 10 new outfits. Naaman kept begging, but Elisha kept refusing. After Naaman had gone only a short distance, When Naaman saw Gehazi running after him, he got out of his chariot to meet him. Naaman asked, &amp;apos;Is everything all right?&amp;apos; &amp;apos;Nowhere, sir,&amp;apos; Gehazi answered. Suddenly, Gehazi's skin became white with leprosy, and he left.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">One day while the Syrian troops were raiding Israel, they captured a girl, and she became a servant of Naaman's wife.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Some time later the girl said, &amp;apos;If your husband Naaman would go to the prophet in Samaria, he would be cured of his leprosy.&amp;apos;</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="5">the king replied, &amp;apos;Go ahead! I will give you a letter to take to the king of Israel.&amp;apos;</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="7">When the king of Israel read the letter, he tore his clothes in fear and shouted, &amp;apos;That Syrian king believes I can cure this man of leprosy! Does he think I'm God with power over life and death? He must be trying to pick a fight with me.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">As soon as Elisha the prophet heard what had happened, he sent the Israelite king this message: &amp;apos;Why are you so afraid? Send the man to me, so that he will know there is a prophet in Israel.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Naaman left with his horses and chariots and stopped at the door of Elisha's house.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Elisha sent someone outside to say to him, &amp;apos;Go wash seven times in the Jordan River. Then you'll be completely cured.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">But Naaman stormed off, grumbling, &amp;apos;Why couldn't he come out and talk to me? I thought for sure he would stand in front of me and pray to the Lord his God, then wave his hand over my skin and cure me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">What about the Abana River or the Pharpar River? Those rivers in Damascus are just as good as any river in Israel. I could have washed in them and been cured.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">His servants went over to him and said, &amp;apos;Sir, if the prophet had told you to do something difficult, you would have done it. So why don't you do what he said? Go wash and be cured.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Naaman walked down to the Jordan; he waded out into the water and stooped down in it seven times, just as Elisha had told him. At once, he was cured, and his skin became as smooth as a child's.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Naaman and his officials went back to Elisha. Naaman stood in front of him and announced, &amp;apos;Now I know that the God of Israel is the only God in the whole world. Sir, would you please accept a gift from me?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">&amp;apos;I am a servant of the living Lord ,&amp;apos; Elisha answered, &amp;apos;and I swear that I will not take anything from you.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Finally Naaman said, &amp;apos;If you won't accept a gift, then please let me take home as much soil as two mules can pull in a wagon. Sir, from now on I will offer sacrifices only to the Lord .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">But I pray that the Lord will forgive me when I go into the temple of the god Rimmon and bow down there with the king of Syria.&amp;apos;</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="20">Gehazi said to himself, &amp;apos;Elisha let that Syrian off too easy. He should have taken Naaman's gift. I swear by the living Lord that I will talk to Naaman myself and get something from him.&amp;apos;</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="22">&amp;apos;Yes,&amp;apos; Gehazi answered. &amp;apos;But my master has sent me to tell you about two young prophets from the hills of Ephraim.

			<VERS vnumber="23">&amp;apos;Sure,&amp;apos; Naaman replied. &amp;apos;But why don't you take twice that amount of silver?&amp;apos; He convinced Gehazi to take it all, then put the silver in two bags. He handed the bags and the clothes to his two servants, and they carried them for Gehazi.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">When they reached the hill where Gehazi lived, he took the bags from the servants and placed them in his house, then sent the men away. After they had gone,</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="5">While one of the prophets was working, his ax head fell off and dropped into the water. &amp;apos;Oh!&amp;apos; he shouted. &amp;apos;Sir, I borrowed this ax.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">&amp;apos;Where did it fall in?&amp;apos; Elisha asked. The prophet pointed to the place, and Elisha cut a stick and threw it into the water at that spot. The ax head floated to the top of the water.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">&amp;apos;Now get it,&amp;apos; Elisha told him. And the prophet reached in and grabbed it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Time after time, when the king of Syria was at war against the Israelites, he met with his officers and announced, &amp;apos;I've decided where we will set up camp.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Each time, Elisha would send this warning to the king of Israel: &amp;apos;Don't go near there. That's where the Syrian troops have set up camp.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">So the king would warn the Israelite troops in that place to be on guard.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">The king of Syria was furious when he found out what was happening. He called in his officers and asked, &amp;apos;Which one of you has been telling the king of Israel our plans?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">&amp;apos;None of us, Your Majesty,&amp;apos; one of them answered. &amp;apos;It's an Israelite named Elisha. He's a prophet, so he can tell his king everything&amp;ndash;even what you say in your own room.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">&amp;apos;Find out where he is!&amp;apos; the king ordered. &amp;apos;I'll send soldiers to bring him here.&amp;apos; They learned that Elisha was in the town of Dothan and reported it to the king. Elisha was home at the time, and the important leaders of Israel were meeting with him. Even before the king's messenger arrived, Elisha told the leaders, &amp;apos;That murderer is sending someone to cut off my head. When you see him coming, shut the door and don't let him in. I'm sure the king himself will be right behind him.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">He ordered his best troops to go there with horses and chariots. They marched out during the night and surrounded the town.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">When Elisha's servant got up the next morning, he saw that Syrian troops had the town surrounded. &amp;apos;Sir, what are we going to do?&amp;apos; he asked.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">&amp;apos;Don't be afraid,&amp;apos; Elisha answered. &amp;apos;There are more troops on our side than on theirs.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Then he prayed, &amp;apos; Lord , please help him to see.&amp;apos; And the Lord let the servant see that the hill was covered with fiery horses and flaming chariots all around Elisha.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">As the Syrian army came closer, Elisha prayed, &amp;apos; Lord , make those soldiers blind!&amp;apos; And the Lord blinded them with a bright light.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Elisha told the enemy troops, &amp;apos;You've taken the wrong road and are in the wrong town. Follow me. I'll lead you to the man you're looking for.&amp;apos; Elisha led them straight to the capital city of Samaria.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">When all the soldiers were inside the city, Elisha prayed, &amp;apos; Lord , now let them see again.&amp;apos; The Lord let them see that they were standing in the middle of Samaria.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">The king of Israel saw them and asked Elisha, &amp;apos;Should I kill them, sir?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">&amp;apos;No!&amp;apos; Elisha answered. &amp;apos;You didn't capture these troops in battle, so you have no right to kill them. Instead, give them something to eat and drink and let them return to their leader.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">The king ordered a huge meal to be prepared for Syria's army, and when they finished eating, he let them go.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">Some time later, King Benhadad of Syria called his entire army together, then they marched to Samaria and attacked.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">They kept up the attack until there was nothing to eat in the city. In fact, a donkey's head cost 80 pieces of silver, and a small bowl of pigeon droppings cost 5 pieces of silver.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">One day as the king of Israel was walking along the top of the city wall, a woman shouted to him, &amp;apos;Please, Your Majesty, help me!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">&amp;apos;Let the Lord help you!&amp;apos; the king said. &amp;apos;Do you think I have grain or wine to give you?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">Then he asked, &amp;apos;What's the matter anyway?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">So yesterday we cooked my son and ate him. But today when I went to her house to eat her son, she had hidden him.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">The king tore off his clothes in sorrow, and since he was on top of the city wall, the people saw that he was wearing sackcloth underneath.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">He said, &amp;apos;I pray that God will punish me terribly, if Elisha's head is still on his shoulders by this time tomorrow.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">Then he sent a messenger to Elisha.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">Before Elisha finished talking, the messenger came up and said, &amp;apos;The Lord has made all these terrible things happen to us. Why should I think he will help us now?&amp;apos;</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="7">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Elisha answered, &amp;apos;I have a message for you. The Lord promises that tomorrow here in Samaria, you will be able to buy a large sack of flour or two large sacks of barley for almost nothing.&amp;apos; &amp;apos;You will see it happen, but you won't eat any of the food,&amp;apos; Elisha warned him. As they walked toward the camp, the Lord caused the Syrian troops to hear what sounded like the roar of a huge cavalry. The soldiers said to each other, &amp;apos;Listen! The king of Israel must have hired Hittite and Egyptian troops to attack us. Let's get out of here!&amp;apos; So they ran out of their camp that night, leaving their tents and horses and donkeys. When the four men with leprosy reached the edge of the Syrian camp, no one was there. They walked into one of the tents, where they ate and drank, before carrying off clothes, as well as silver and gold. They hid all this, then walked into another tent; they took what they wanted and hid it too.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">The chief officer there with the king replied, &amp;apos;I don't believe it! Even if the Lord sent a rainstorm, it couldn't produce that much grain by tomorrow.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">About the same time, four men with leprosy were just outside the gate of Samaria. They said to each other, &amp;apos;Why should we sit here, waiting to die?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">There's nothing to eat in the city, so we would starve if we went inside. But if we stay out here, we will die for sure. Let's sneak over to the Syrian army camp and surrender. They might kill us, but they might not.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">They said to each other, &amp;apos;This isn't right. Today is a day to celebrate, and we haven't told anyone else what has happened. If we wait until morning, we will be punished. Let's go to the king's palace at once and tell the good news.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">They went back to Samaria and shouted up to the guards at the gate, &amp;apos;We've just come from the Syrian army camp, and all the soldiers are gone! The tents are empty, and the horses and donkeys are still tied up. We didn't see or hear anybody.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">The guards reported the news to the king's palace.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">The king got out of bed and said to his officers, &amp;apos;I know what those Syrians are doing. They know we're starving, so they're hiding in the fields, hoping we will go out to look for food. When we do, they can capture us and take over our city.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">One of his officers replied, &amp;apos;We have a few horses left&amp;ndash;why don't we let some men take five of them and go to the Syrian camp and see what's happening? We're going to die anyway like those who have already died.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">They found two chariots, and the king commanded the men to find out what had happened to the Syrian troops.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">The men rode as far as the Jordan River. All along the way they saw clothes and equipment that the Syrians had thrown away as they escaped. Then they went back to the king and told him what they had seen.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">At once the people went to the Syrian camp and carried off what was left. They took so much that a large sack of flour and two large sacks of barley sold for almost nothing, just as the Lord had promised.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">The king of Israel had put his chief officer in charge of the gate, but he died when the people trampled him as they rushed out of the city.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Earlier, when the king was at Elisha's house, Elisha had told him that flour or barley would sell for almost nothing.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">But the officer refused to believe that even the Lord could do that. So Elisha warned him that he would see it happen, but would not eat any of the food.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">And that's exactly what happened&amp;ndash;the officer was trampled to death.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="8">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Elisha told the woman whose son he had brought back to life, &amp;apos;The Lord has warned that there will be no food here for seven years. Take your family and go live somewhere else for a while.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">The woman did exactly what Elisha had said and went to live in Philistine territory. She and her family lived there seven years. &amp;apos;Here's the boy, Your Majesty,&amp;apos; Gehazi said. &amp;apos;And this is his mother.&amp;apos; Elisha answered, &amp;apos;Because I know the terrible things you will do to the people of Israel. You will burn down their walled cities and slaughter their young men. You will even crush the heads of their babies and rip open their pregnant women.&amp;apos; &amp;apos;Hazael, the Lord has told me that you will be the next king of Syria.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Then she returned to Israel and immediately begged the king to give back her house and property.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Meanwhile, the king was asking Gehazi the servant of Elisha about the amazing things Elisha had been doing.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">While Gehazi was telling him that Elisha had brought a dead boy back to life, the woman and her son arrived.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">The king asked the woman to tell her story, and she told him everything that had happened. He then said to one of his officials, &amp;apos;I want you to make sure that this woman gets back everything that belonged to her, including the money her crops have made since the day she left Israel.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Some time later Elisha went to the capital city of Damascus to visit King Benhadad of Syria, who was sick. And when Benhadad was told he was there,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">he said to Hazael, &amp;apos;Go meet with Elisha the man of God and get him to ask the Lord if I will get well. And take along a gift for him.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Hazael left with forty camel loads of the best things made in Damascus as a gift for Elisha. He found the prophet and said, &amp;apos;Your servant, King Benhadad, wants to know if he will get well.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">&amp;apos;Tell him he will,&amp;apos; Elisha said to Hazael. &amp;apos;But the Lord has already told me that Benhadad will definitely die.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Elisha stared at him until Hazael was embarrassed, then Elisha began crying.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">&amp;apos;Sir, why are you crying?&amp;apos; Hazael asked.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">&amp;apos;How could I ever do anything like that?&amp;apos; Hazael replied. &amp;apos;I'm only a servant and don't have that kind of power.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Hazael went back to Benhadad and told him, &amp;apos;Elisha said that you will get well.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">But the very next day, Hazael got a thick blanket; he soaked it in water and held it over Benhadad's face until he died. Hazael then became king.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Jehoram son of Jehoshaphat became king of Judah in Joram's fifth year as king of Israel, while Jehoshaphat was still king of Judah.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Jehoram was 32 years old when he became king, and he ruled 8 years from Jerusalem.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Jehoram disobeyed the Lord by doing wrong. He married Ahab's daughter and was as sinful as Ahab's family and the kings of Israel.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">But the Lord refused to destroy Judah, because he had promised his servant David that someone from his family would always rule in Judah.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">While Jehoram was king, the people of Edom rebelled and chose their own king.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">So Jehoram and his cavalry marched to Zair, where the Edomite army surrounded him and his commanders. During the night he attacked the Edomites, but he was defeated, and his troops escaped to their homes.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Judah was never able to regain control of Edom. Even the town of Libnah rebelled at that time.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">Everything else Jehoram did while he was king is written in The History of the Kings of Judah .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">Jehoram died and was buried beside his ancestors in Jerusalem. His son Ahaziah then became king.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">Ahaziah son of Jehoram became king of Judah in the twelfth year of Joram's rule in Israel.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">Ahaziah was 22 years old when he became king, and he ruled from Jerusalem for only one year. His mother was Athaliah, a granddaughter of King Omri of Israel.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">Since Ahaziah was related to Ahab's family, he acted just like them and disobeyed the Lord by doing wrong.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">Ahaziah went with King Joram of Israel to attack King Hazael and the Syrian troops at Ramoth in Gilead. Joram was wounded in that battle,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">so he went to the town of Jezreel to recover. Ahaziah went there to visit him.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="9">
			<VERS vnumber="1">One day, Elisha called for one of the other prophets and said: Take this bottle of olive oil and get ready to go to the town of Ramoth in Gilead. &amp;apos;For which one of us?&amp;apos; Jehu asked. &amp;apos;You, sir,&amp;apos; the prophet answered. The Lord God of Israel has this message for you: &amp;apos;I am the Lord , and I have chosen you to be king of my people Israel. Then the young prophet opened the door and ran out. &amp;apos;You know him and how he talks,&amp;apos; Jehu answered. &amp;apos;He had a message from the Lord ,&amp;apos; Jehu replied. &amp;apos;He said that the Lord has chosen me to be the next king of Israel.&amp;apos; Meanwhile, Jehu was in Ramoth, making plans to kill Joram. He said to his officers, &amp;apos;If you want me to be king, then don't let anyone leave this town. They might go to Jezreel and tell Joram.&amp;apos; Then Jehu got in his chariot and rode to Jezreel. Joram ordered, &amp;apos;Send someone out to ask them if this is a friendly visit.&amp;apos; &amp;apos;What's it to you?&amp;apos; Jehu asked. &amp;apos;Just stay behind me with the rest of my troops!&amp;apos; About the same time the guard in the watchtower said, &amp;apos;Your Majesty, the rider got there, but he isn't coming back.&amp;apos; &amp;apos;What's it to you?&amp;apos; Jehu asked. &amp;apos;Just get behind me with the rest of my troops!&amp;apos; &amp;apos;How can there be peace?&amp;apos; Jehu asked. &amp;apos;Your mother Jezebel has caused everyone to worship idols and practice witchcraft.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">When you get there, find Jehu son of Jehoshaphat and grandson of Nimshi. Take him to a place where the two of you can be alone,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">then pour olive oil on his head to show that he is the new king. Say to him, &amp;apos;The Lord has chosen you to be king of Israel.&amp;apos; Then leave quickly&amp;ndash;don't wait around for anything!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">The young prophet left for Ramoth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">When he arrived, the army officers were meeting together. &amp;apos;Sir, I have a message for you,&amp;apos; he said.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">So Jehu got up and went inside. The prophet poured olive oil on Jehu's head and told him:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">I want you to wipe out the family of Ahab, so Jezebel will be punished for killing the prophets and my other servants.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Every man and boy in Ahab's family must die, whether slave or free.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">His whole family must be destroyed, just like the families of Jeroboam son of Nebat and Baasha son of Ahijah.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">As for Jezebel, her body will be eaten by dogs in the town of Jezreel. There won't be enough left of her to bury.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Jehu went back to his officers, and one of them asked, &amp;apos;What did that crazy prophet want? Is everything all right?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">&amp;apos;No, we don't. What did he say?&amp;apos; they asked.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">They quickly grabbed their coats and spread them out on the steps where Jehu was standing. Someone blew a trumpet, and everyone shouted, &amp;apos;Jehu is king!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">When the guard in the watchtower at Jezreel saw Jehu and his men riding up, he shouted to the king, &amp;apos;I see a large group of men coming this way.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">One of the soldiers rode out and said to Jehu, &amp;apos;King Joram wants to know if this is a friendly visit.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">So Joram sent out another rider, who rode up to Jehu and said, &amp;apos;The king wants to know if this is a friendly visit.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">The guard in the watchtower said, &amp;apos;Your Majesty, the rider got there, but he isn't coming back either. Wait a minute! That one man is a reckless chariot driver&amp;ndash;it must be Jehu!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Joram commanded, &amp;apos;Get my chariot ready.&amp;apos; Then he and Ahaziah got in their chariots and rode out to meet Jehu. They all met on the land that had belonged to Naboth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Joram asked, &amp;apos;Jehu, is this a peaceful visit?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">&amp;apos;Ahaziah, let's get out of here!&amp;apos; Joram yelled. &amp;apos;It's a trap!&amp;apos; As Joram tried to escape,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">Jehu shot an arrow. It hit Joram between his shoulders, then it went through his heart and came out his chest. He fell over dead in his chariot.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">Ahaziah saw all of this happen and tried to escape to the town of Beth-Haggan, but Jehu caught up with him and shouted, &amp;apos;Kill him too!&amp;apos; So his troops shot Ahaziah with an arrow while he was on the road to Gur near Ibleam. He went as far as Megiddo, where he died.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">Ahaziah's officers put his body in a chariot and took it back to Jerusalem, where they buried him beside his ancestors.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">Ahaziah had become king of Judah in the eleventh year of the rule of Ahab's son Joram.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">Jehu headed toward Jezreel, and when Jezebel heard he was coming, she put on eye shadow and brushed her hair. Then she stood at the window, waiting for him to arrive.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">As he walked through the city gate, she shouted down to him, &amp;apos;Why did you come here, you murderer? To kill the king? You're no better than Zimri!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">He looked up toward the window and asked, &amp;apos;Is anyone up there on my side?&amp;apos; A few palace workers stuck their heads out of a window,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">and Jehu shouted, &amp;apos;Throw her out the window!&amp;apos; They threw her down, and her blood splattered on the walls and on the horses that trampled her body.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">Jehu left to get something to eat and drink. Then he told some workers, &amp;apos;Even though she was evil, she was a king's daughter, so make sure she has a proper burial.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">But when they went out to bury her body, they found only her skull, her hands, and her feet.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">They reported this to Jehu, and he said, &amp;apos;The Lord told Elijah the prophet that Jezebel's body would be eaten by dogs right here in Jezreel.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">And he warned that her bones would be spread all over the ground like manure, so that no one could tell who it was.&amp;apos;</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="10">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Ahab still had 70 descendants living in Samaria. So Jehu wrote a letter to each of the important leaders and officials of the town, and to those who supported Ahab. In the letters he wrote: The 70 descendants of King Ahab were living with some of the most important people of the city. &amp;apos;We are relatives of Ahaziah,&amp;apos; they answered. &amp;apos;We're going to visit his family.&amp;apos; &amp;apos;Yes, I am.&amp;apos; &amp;apos;Then give me your hand,&amp;apos; Jehu answered. He helped Jehonadab into his chariot They rode together in Jehu's chariot King Ahab sometimes worshiped Baal, but I will be completely faithful to Baal. But this was a trick&amp;ndash;Jehu was really planning to kill the worshipers of Baal. Earlier, Jehu had ordered 80 soldiers to wait outside the temple. He had warned them, &amp;apos;I will get all these worshipers here, and if any of you let even one of them escape, you will be killed instead!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Your town is strong, and you're protected by chariots and an armed cavalry. And I know that King Ahab's descendants live there with you. So as soon as you read this letter,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">choose the best person for the job and make him the next king. Then be prepared to defend Ahab's family.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">The officials and leaders read the letters and were very frightened. They said to each other, &amp;apos;Jehu has already killed King Joram and King Ahaziah! We have to do what he says.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">The prime minister, the mayor of the city, as well as the other leaders and Ahab's supporters, sent this answer to Jehu, &amp;apos;We are your servants, Your Majesty, and we will do whatever you tell us. But it's not our place to choose someone to be king. You do what you think is best.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Jehu then wrote another letter which said, &amp;apos;If you are on my side and will obey me, then prove it. Bring me the heads of the descendants of Ahab! And be here in Jezreel by this time tomorrow.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">And when these people read Jehu's second letter, they called together all 70 of Ahab's descendants. They killed them, put their heads in baskets, and sent them to Jezreel.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">When Jehu was told what had happened, he said, &amp;apos;Put the heads in two piles at the city gate, and leave them there until morning.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">The next morning, Jehu went out and stood where everyone could hear him, and he said, &amp;apos;You people are not guilty of anything. I'm the one who plotted against Joram and had him killed. But who killed all these men?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Listen to me. Everything the Lord 's servant Elijah promised about Ahab's family will come true.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Then Jehu killed the rest of Ahab's relatives living in Jezreel, as well as his highest officials, his priests, and his closest friends. No one in Ahab's family was left alive in Jezreel.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">&amp;apos;Take them alive!&amp;apos; Jehu said to his officers. So they grabbed them and led them to the well near the shepherds' meeting place, where they killed all 42 of them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">As Jehu went on, he saw Jehonadab son of Rechab coming to meet him. Jehu greeted him, then said, &amp;apos;Jehonadab, I'm on your side. Are you on mine?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">and said, &amp;apos;Come with me and see how faithful I am to the Lord .&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">to Samaria. Jehu killed everyone there who belonged to Ahab's family, as well as all his officials. Everyone in his family was now dead, just as the Lord had promised Elijah.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Jehu called together the people in Samaria and said:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">I'm going to offer a huge sacrifice to him. So invite his prophets and priests, and be sure everyone who worships him is there. Anyone who doesn't come will be killed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">He said, &amp;apos;Announce a day of worship for Baal!&amp;apos; After the day had been announced,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Jehu sent an invitation to everyone in Israel. All the worshipers of Baal came, and the temple was filled from one end to the other.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Jehu told the official in charge of the sacred robes to make sure that everyone had a robe to wear.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">Jehu and Jehonadab went into the temple, and Jehu said to the crowd, &amp;apos;Look around and make sure that only the worshipers of Baal are here. No one who worships the Lord is allowed in.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">Then they began to offer sacrifices to Baal.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">As soon as Jehu finished offering the sacrifice, he told the guards and soldiers, &amp;apos;Come in and kill them! Don't let anyone escape.&amp;apos; They slaughtered everyone in the crowd and threw the bodies outside. Then they went back into the temple</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">and carried out the image of Baal. They burned it</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">and broke it into pieces, then they completely destroyed Baal's temple. And since that time, it's been nothing but a public toilet.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">That's how Jehu stopped the worship of Baal in Israel.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">But he did not stop the worship of the gold statues of calves at Dan and Bethel that Jeroboam had made for the people to worship.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">Later the Lord said, &amp;apos;Jehu, you have done right by destroying Ahab's entire family, just as I had planned. So I will make sure that the next four kings of Israel will come from your own family.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">But Jehu did not completely obey the commands of the Lord God of Israel. Instead, he kept doing the sinful things that Jeroboam had caused the Israelites to do.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">In those days the Lord began to reduce the size of Israel's territory. King Hazael of Syria defeated the Israelites and took control</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">of the regions of Gilead and Bashan east of the Jordan River and north of the town of Aroer near the Arnon River. This was the land where the tribes of Gad, Reuben, and Manasseh had once lived.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="4">Joash son of Ahaziah had hidden in the Lord 's temple six years. Then in the seventh year, Jehoiada the priest sent for the commanders of the king's special bodyguards and the commanders of the palace guards.

			<VERS vnumber="8">Make sure they follow him wherever he goes, and tell them to keep their swords ready to kill anyone who tries to get near him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">The commanders followed Jehoiada's orders. Each one called together his guards&amp;ndash;those coming on duty and those going off duty.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Jehoiada brought out the swords and shields that had belonged to King David and gave them to the commanders.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Then they gave the weapons to their guards, who took their positions around the temple and the altar to protect Joash on every side.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Jehoiada brought Joash outside, where he placed the crown on his head and gave him a copy of instructions for ruling the nation. Olive oil was poured on his head to show that he was now king, while the crowd clapped and shouted, &amp;apos;Long live the king!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Queen Athaliah heard the crowd and went to the temple.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">There she saw Joash standing by one of the columns, which was the usual place for the king. The singers and the trumpet players were standing next to him, and the people were celebrating and blowing trumpets. Athaliah tore her clothes in anger and shouted, &amp;apos;You betrayed me, you traitors!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">At once, Jehoiada said to the army commanders, &amp;apos;Kill her! But don't do it anywhere near the Lord 's temple. Take her out in front of the troops and kill anyone who is with her!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">So the commanders dragged her to the gate where horses are led into the palace, and they killed her there.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Jehoiada the priest asked King Joash and the people to promise that they would be faithful to each other and to the Lord .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Then the crowd went to the temple built to honor Baal and tore it down. They smashed the altars and idols and killed Mattan the priest of Baal right in front of the altars.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">he called together all the commanders, the king's special bodyguards, the palace guards, and the people. They led Joash from the temple, through the Guards' Gate, and into the palace. He took his place on the throne and became king of Judah.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="8">The priests agreed that they would not collect any more money or be in charge of the temple repairs.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Jehoiada found a wooden box; he cut a hole in the top of it and set it on the right side of the altar where people went into the temple. Whenever someone gave money to the temple, the priests guarding the entrance would put it into this box.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="18">So Joash collected everything he and his ancestors Jehoshaphat, Jehoram, and Ahaziah had dedicated to the Lord , as well as the gold in the storage rooms in the temple and palace.

			<VERS vnumber="1">Hezekiah son of Ahaz became king of Judah in the third year of Hoshea's rule in Israel.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Hezekiah was 25 years old when he became king, and he ruled 29 years from Jerusalem. His mother Abi was the daughter of Zechariah. Sennacherib told Hezekiah to pay ten tons of silver and one ton of gold. I have a message for Hezekiah from the great king of Assyria. Ask Hezekiah why he feels so sure of himself. Listen to what the great king of Assyria says! Hezekiah claims the Lord will save you. But don't be fooled by him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Hezekiah obeyed the Lord , just as his ancestor David had done.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">He destroyed the local shrines, then tore down the images of foreign gods and cut down the sacred pole for worshiping the goddess Asherah. He also smashed the bronze snake Moses had made. The people had named it Nehushtan and had been offering sacrifices to it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Hezekiah trusted the Lord God of Israel. No other king of Judah was like Hezekiah, either before or after him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">He was completely faithful to the Lord and obeyed the laws the Lord had given to Moses for the people.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">The Lord helped Hezekiah, so he was successful in everything he did. He even rebelled against the king of Assyria, refusing to be his servant.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Hezekiah defeated the Philistine towns as far away as Gaza&amp;ndash;from the smallest towns to the large, walled cities.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">During the fourth year of Hezekiah's rule, which was the seventh year of Hoshea's rule in Israel, King Shalmaneser of Assyria led his troops to Samaria, the capital city of Israel. They attacked</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="11">The king of Assyria took the Israelites away as prisoners; he forced some of them to live in the town of Halah, others to live near the Habor River in the territory of Gozan, and still others to live in towns where the Median people lived.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">All of that happened because the people of Israel had not obeyed the Lord their God. They rejected the solemn agreement he had made with them, and they ignored everything that the Lord 's servant Moses had told them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">In the fourteenth year of Hezekiah's rule in Judah, King Sennacherib of Assyria invaded the country and captured every walled city, except Jerusalem.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Hezekiah sent this message to Sennacherib, who was in the town of Lachish: &amp;apos;I know I am guilty of rebellion. But I will pay you whatever you want, if you stop your attack.&amp;apos;</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="16">He even stripped the gold that he had used to cover the doors and doorposts in the temple. He gave it all to Sennacherib.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">The king of Assyria ordered his three highest military officers to leave Lachish and take a large army to Jerusalem. When they arrived, the officers stood on the road near the cloth makers' shops along the canal from the upper pool.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="19">One of the Assyrian commanders told them:</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="21">Is he depending on Egypt and its king? That's the same as leaning on a broken stick, and it will go right through his hand.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Is Hezekiah now depending on the Lord your God? Didn't Hezekiah tear down all except one of the Lord 's altars and places of worship? Didn't he tell the people of Jerusalem and Judah to worship at that one place?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">The king of Assyria wants to make a bet with you people. He will give you 2,000 horses, if you have enough troops to ride them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">How could you even defeat our lowest ranking officer, when you have to depend on Egypt for chariots and cavalry?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">Don't forget that it was the Lord who sent me here with orders to destroy your nation!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">Eliakim, Shebna, and Joah said, &amp;apos;Sir, we don't want the people listening from the city wall to understand what you are saying. So please speak to us in Aramaic instead of Hebrew.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">The Assyrian army commander answered, &amp;apos;My king sent me to speak to everyone, not just to you leaders. These people will soon have to eat their own body waste and drink their own urine! And so will the three of you.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">Then, in a voice loud enough for everyone to hear, he shouted in Hebrew:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">Don't be fooled by Hezekiah. He can't save you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">Don't trust him when he tells you that the Lord will protect you from the king of Assyria.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">Stop listening to Hezekiah! Pay attention to my king. Surrender to him. He will let you keep your own vineyards, fig trees, and cisterns</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">for a while. Then he will come and take you away to a country just like yours, where you can plant vineyards, raise your own grain, and have plenty of olive oil and honey. Believe me, you won't starve there.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">Were any other gods able to defend their land against the king of Assyria?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">What happened to the gods of Hamath and Arpad? What about the gods of Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivvah? Were the gods of Samaria able to protect their land against the Assyrian forces?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">None of these gods kept their people safe from the king of Assyria. Do you think the Lord your God can do any better?</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="4">Josiah told Hilkiah the priest, the assistant priests, and the guards at the temple door to go into the temple and bring out the things used to worship Baal, Asherah, and the stars. Josiah had these things burned in Kidron Valley just outside Jerusalem, and he had the ashes carried away to the town of Bethel.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Josiah also got rid of the pagan priests at the local shrines in Judah and around Jerusalem. These were the men that the kings of Judah had appointed to offer sacrifices to Baal and to the sun, moon, and stars.</VERS>

Josiah brought these priests to Jerusalem and had their shrines made unfit for worship&amp;ndash;every shrine from Geba just north of Jerusalem to Beersheba in the south. He even tore down the shrine at Beersheba that was just to the left of Joshua Gate, which was named after the highest official of the city.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Those local priests could not serve at the Lord 's altar in Jerusalem, but they were allowed to eat sacred bread, just like the priests from Jerusalem.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="16">As he looked around, he saw graves on the hillside. He had the bones in them dug up and burned on the altar, so that it could no longer be used. This happened just as God's prophet had said when Jeroboam was standing at the altar, celebrating a festival.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="18">Josiah replied, &amp;apos;Then leave it alone. Don't dig up his bones.&amp;apos; So they did not disturb his bones or the bones of the old prophet from Israel who had also been buried there.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="24">Gedaliah said to them, &amp;apos;Everything will be fine, I promise. We don't need to be afraid of the Babylonian rulers, if we live here peacefully and do what Nebuchadnezzar says.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">Ishmael was from the royal family. And about two months after Gedaliah began his rule, Ishmael and ten other men went to Mizpah. They killed Gedaliah and his officials, including those from Judah and those from Babylonia.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">After that, the army officers and all the people in Mizpah, whether important or not, were afraid of what the Babylonians might do. So they left Judah and went to Egypt.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">Jehoiachin was a prisoner in Babylon for 37 years. Then Evil-Merodach became king of Babylonia, and in the first year of his rule, on the twenty-seventh day of the twelfth month, he let Jehoiachin out of prison.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">Evil-Merodach was kind to Jehoiachin and honored him more than any of the other kings held prisoner there.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="10">The Lord God was very angry with Uzzah for doing this, and he killed Uzzah right there beside the chest.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">David then got angry with God for killing Uzzah. So he named that place &amp;apos;Attack on Uzzah,&amp;apos; and it's been called that ever since.</VERS>

Now I promise that like you, your descendants will be kings. Lord God, my family and I don't deserve what you have already done for us, My kingdom will be strong,</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="3">Joab answered, &amp;apos;Your Majesty, even if the Lord made your kingdom a hundred times larger, you would still rule everyone in it. Why do you need to know how many soldiers there are? Don't you think that would make the whole nation angry?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">But David would not change his mind. And so Joab went everywhere in Israel and Judah and counted the people. He returned to Jerusalem</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="6">Joab refused to include anyone from the tribes of Levi and Benjamin, because he still disagreed with David's orders.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="8">David prayed, &amp;apos;I am your servant. But what I did was stupid and terribly wrong. Please forgive me.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">The Lord said to Gad, one of David's prophets,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">&amp;apos;Tell David that I will punish him in one of three ways. But he will have to choose which one it will be.&amp;apos;</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="12">Will there be three years when the land won't grow enough food for its people? Or will your enemies constantly defeat you for three months? Or will the Lord send a horrible disease to strike your land for three days? Think about it and decide, because I have to give your answer to God who sent me.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="14">So the Lord sent a horrible disease on Israel, and 70,000 Israelites died.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Then he sent an angel to destroy the city of Jerusalem. But just as the angel was about to do that, the Lord felt sorry for all the suffering he had caused the people, and he told the angel, &amp;apos;Stop! They have suffered enough.&amp;apos; This happened at the threshing place that belonged to Araunah the Jebusite.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">David saw the Lord 's angel in the air, holding a sword over Jerusalem. He and the leaders of Israel, who were all wearing sackcloth, bowed with their faces to the ground,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">and David prayed, &amp;apos;It's my fault! I sinned by ordering the people to be counted. They have done nothing wrong&amp;ndash;they are innocent sheep. Lord God, please punish me and my family. Don't let the disease wipe out your people.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">The Lord 's angel told the prophet Gad to tell David that he must go to Araunah's threshing place and build an altar in honor of the Lord .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">David followed the Lord 's instructions.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Araunah and his four sons were threshing wheat at the time, and when they saw the angel, the four sons ran to hide.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Just then, David arrived, and when Araunah saw him, he stopped his work and bowed down.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">David said, &amp;apos;Would you sell me your threshing place, so I can build an altar on it to the Lord ? Then this disease will stop killing the people. I'm willing to pay whatever you say it's worth.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">Araunah answered, &amp;apos;Take it, Your Majesty, and do whatever you want with it. I'll even give you the oxen for the sacrifice and the wheat for the grain sacrifice. And you can use the threshing-boards for the fire. It's all yours!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">But David replied, &amp;apos;No! I want to pay you what they're worth. I can't just take something from you and then offer the Lord a sacrifice that cost me nothing.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">So David paid Araunah 600 gold coins for his threshing place.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">David built an altar and offered sacrifices to please the Lord and sacrifices to ask his blessing. David prayed, and the Lord answered him by sending fire down on the altar.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">Then the Lord commanded the angel to put the sword away.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">When David saw that the Lord had answered his prayer, he offered more sacrifices there at the threshing place,</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="22">
			<VERS vnumber="1">David said, &amp;apos;The temple of the Lord God must be built right here at this threshing place. And the altar for offering sacrifices will also be here.&amp;apos; That's why David did all these things before he died. My son, I wanted to build a temple where the Lord my God would be worshiped. The Lord our God has helped me defeat all the people who lived here before us, and he has given you peace from all your enemies. Now this land belongs to the Lord and his people.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">David ordered the foreigners living in Israel to come to Jerusalem. Then he assigned some to cut blocks of stone for building the temple.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">He got a large supply of iron to make into nails and hinges for the doors, and he provided so much bronze that it could not be weighed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">He also brought an endless supply of cedar logs from the cities of Sidon and Tyre.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">He said, &amp;apos;The temple for the Lord must be great, so that everyone in the world will know about it. But since my son Solomon is young and has no experience, I will make sure that everything is ready for the temple to be built.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">David sent for his son Solomon and told him to build a temple for the Lord God of Israel.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">He said:</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="9">But when your son becomes king, I will give him peace throughout his kingdom. His name will be Solomon, because during his rule I will keep Israel safe and peaceful.</VERS>

The Lord also promised him that Jerusalem would be the city where his temple will be built, and now that promise has come true. Lord God of Israel, no other god in heaven or on earth is like you! You never forget the agreement you made with your people, and you are loyal to anyone who faithfully obeys your teachings.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1">As soon as Solomon finished praying, fire came down from heaven and burned up the offerings. The Lord 's dazzling glory then filled the temple,</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="3">When the crowd of people saw the fire and the Lord 's glory, they knelt down and worshiped the Lord . They prayed:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Everybody stood up during the ceremony. The priests were in their assigned places, blowing their trumpets. And the Levites faced them, playing the musical instruments that David had made for them to use when they praised the Lord for his never-ending love.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">On that same day, Solomon dedicated the courtyard in front of the temple and got it ready to be used for worship. The bronze altar he had made was too small, so he used the courtyard to offer sacrifices to please the Lord and grain sacrifices, and also to send up in smoke the fat from the other offerings.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">For 7 days, Solomon and the crowd celebrated the Festival of Shelters, and people came from as far away as the Egyptian Gorge in the south and Lebo-Hamath in the north.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Then on the next day, everyone came together for worship. They had celebrated a total of 14 days, 7 days for the dedication of the altar and 7 more days for the festival.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Then on the twenty-third day of the seventh month, Solomon sent everyone home. They left very happy because of all the good things the Lord had done for David and Solomon, and for his people Israel.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">The Lord 's temple and Solomon's palace were now finished. In fact, everything Solomon had planned to do was completed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Some time later, the Lord appeared to Solomon in a dream and said:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Suppose I hold back the rain or send locusts to eat the crops or make my people suffer with deadly diseases.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">If my own people will humbly pray and turn back to me and stop sinning, then I will answer them from heaven. I will forgive them and make their land fertile once again.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">I will hear the prayers made in this temple,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">because it belongs to me, and this is where I will be worshiped forever. I will never stop watching over it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Your father David obeyed me, and now, Solomon, you must do the same. Obey my laws and teachings,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">and I will keep my solemn promise to him that someone from your family will always be king of Israel.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">But if you or any of the people of Israel disobey my laws or start worshiping foreign gods,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">I will pull you out of this land I gave you. I will desert this temple where I said I would be worshiped, so that people everywhere will think it is only a joke and will make fun of it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">This temple is now magnificent. But when these things happen, everyone who walks by it will be shocked and will ask, &amp;apos;Why did the Lord do such a terrible thing to his people and to this temple?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Then they will answer, &amp;apos;It was because the people of Israel rejected the Lord their God, who rescued their ancestors from Egypt, and they started worshiping other gods.&amp;apos;</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1">It took 20 years for the Lord 's temple and Solomon's palace to be built.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="3">Solomon attacked and captured the town of Hamath-Zobah.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">He ordered his workers to build the town of Tadmor in the desert and some towns in Hamath where he could keep his supplies.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">He strengthened Upper Beth-Horon and Lower Beth-Horon by adding walls and gates that could be locked.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">He did the same thing to the town of Baalath and to the cities where he kept supplies, chariots, and horses. Solomon ordered his workers to build whatever he wanted in Jerusalem, Lebanon, and anywhere else in his kingdom.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Solomon appointed 250 officers to be in charge of his workers.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Solomon's wife, the daughter of the king of Egypt, moved from the part of Jerusalem called David's City to her new palace that Solomon had built. The sacred chest had been kept in David's City, which made his palace sacred, and so Solomon's wife could no longer live there.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Solomon offered sacrifices to the Lord on the altar he had built in front of the temple porch.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">He followed the requirements that Moses had given for sacrifices offered on the Sabbath, on the first day of each month, the Festival of Thin Bread, the Harvest Festival, and the Festival of Shelters.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Solomon then assigned the priests and the Levites their duties at the temple, and he followed the instructions that his father, the man of God, had given him. Some of the Levites were to lead music and help the priests in their duties, and others were to guard the temple gates</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">and the storage rooms. The priests and Levites followed these instructions exactly.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Everything Solomon had planned to do was now finished&amp;ndash;from the laying of the temple's foundation to its completion.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Solomon went to Ezion-Geber and Eloth, two Edomite towns on the Red Sea.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1">The Queen of Sheba heard how famous Solomon was, so she went to Jerusalem to test him with difficult questions. She took along several of her officials, and she loaded her camels with gifts of spices, jewels, and gold. When she arrived, she and Solomon talked about everything she could think of.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">He answered every question, no matter how difficult it was. Solomon, in my own country I had heard about your wisdom and all you've done.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">She said:</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="7">Your people and officials are lucky to be here where they can listen to the wise things you say.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">I praise the Lord your God. He is pleased with you and has made you king of Israel. God loves the people of this country and will never desert them, so he has given them a king who will rule fairly and honestly.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">The Queen of Sheba gave Solomon more than four tons of gold, a large amount of jewels, and the best spices anyone had ever seen.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Solomon received almost 23 tons of gold each year,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">not counting what the merchants and traders brought him. The kings of Arabia and the leaders of Israel also gave him gold and silver.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Solomon made 200 gold shields that weighed over three kilograms each.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">He also made 300 smaller gold shields that weighed almost two kilograms, and he put these shields in his palace in Forest Hall.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">His throne was made of ivory and covered with pure gold.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">It had a gold footstool attached to it and armrests on each side. There was a statue of a lion on each side of the throne,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">and there were two lion statues on each of the six steps leading up to the throne. No other throne in the world was like Solomon's.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Solomon's cups and dishes in Forest Hall were made of pure gold, because silver was almost worthless in those days.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Solomon had a lot of seagoing ships. Every three years he sent them out with Hiram's ships to bring back gold, silver, and ivory, as well as monkeys and peacocks.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Solomon was the richest and wisest king in the world.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">Solomon had 4,000 stalls for his horses and chariots, and he owned 12,000 horses that he kept in Jerusalem and other towns.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="3">The people from the northern tribes of Israel sent for him. Then together they went to Rehoboam and said,</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="5">Rehoboam replied, &amp;apos;Come back in three days for my answer.&amp;apos; So the people left.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Rehoboam went to some leaders who had been his father's senior officials, and he asked them, &amp;apos;What should I tell these people?&amp;apos;</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="10">His younger advisors said: Here's what we think you should say to them: &amp;apos;Compared to me, my father was weak. Adoniram was in charge of the work force, and Rehoboam sent him to talk to the people. But they stoned him to death. Then Rehoboam ran to his chariot and hurried back to Jerusalem. Everyone from Israel's northern tribes went home, leaving Rehoboam to rule only the people from Judah. And since that day, the people of Israel have been opposed to David's descendants in Judah. All of this happened just as Ahijah the Lord 's prophet from Shiloh had told Jeroboam.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">He made you work hard, but I'll make you work even harder. He punished you with whips, but I'll use whips with pieces of sharp metal!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Three days later, Jeroboam and the others came back.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Rehoboam ignored the advice of the older advisors. He spoke bluntly</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1">After Rehoboam returned to Jerusalem, he decided to attack Israel and regain control of the whole country. So he called together 180,000 soldiers from the tribes of Judah and Benjamin. Rehoboam and his army obeyed the Lord 's message and did not attack Jeroboam and his troops.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Meanwhile, the Lord had told Shemaiah the prophet</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="12">as well as with shields and spears. He used these fortified cities to keep control of Judah and Benjamin.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">The priests and Levites from the northern tribes of Israel gave their support to King Rehoboam.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">And since Jeroboam and the kings of Israel that followed him would not allow any Levites to serve as priests, most Levites left their towns and pasturelands in Israel and moved to Jerusalem and other towns in Judah.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Jeroboam chose his own priests to serve at the local shrines in Israel and at the places of worship where he had set up statues of goat-demons and of calves.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">But some of the people from Israel wanted to worship the Lord God, just as their ancestors had done. So they followed the priests and Levites to Jerusalem, where they could offer sacrifices to the Lord .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">For the next three years, they lived in Judah and were loyal to Rehoboam and his kingdom, just as they had been loyal to David and Solomon.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="2">So in the fifth year of Rehoboam's rule, the Lord punished them for their unfaithfulness and allowed King Shishak of Egypt to invade Judah.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Shishak attacked with his army of 1,200 chariots and 60,000 cavalry troops, as well as countless Egyptian soldiers from Libya, Sukkoth, and Ethiopia.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">He captured every one of the fortified cities in Judah and then marched to Jerusalem. The people of Judah are truly sorry for their sins, and so I won't let Shishak completely destroy them. But because I am still angry, Then my people will know what it's like to serve a foreign king instead of serving me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Rehoboam and the leaders of Judah had gone to Jerusalem to escape Shishak's invasion. And while they were there, Shemaiah the prophet told them, &amp;apos;The Lord says that because you have disobeyed him, he has now abandoned you. The Lord will not help you against Shishak!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Rehoboam and the leaders were sorry for what they had done and admitted, &amp;apos;The Lord is right. We have deserted him.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">When the Lord heard this, he told Shemaiah:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">he will conquer and rule them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Shishak attacked Jerusalem and took all the valuable things from the temple and from the palace, including Solomon's gold shields.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Rehoboam had bronze shields made to replace the gold ones, and he ordered the guards at the city gates to keep them safe.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Whenever Rehoboam went to the Lord 's temple, the guards carried the shields. But they always took them back to the guardroom as soon as he had finished worshiping.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Rehoboam turned back to the Lord , and so the Lord did not let Judah be completely destroyed, and Judah was prosperous again.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Rehoboam was 41 years old when he became king, and he ruled 17 years from Jerusalem, the city where the Lord had chosen to be worshiped. His mother Naamah was from Ammon. Rehoboam was a powerful king,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">but he still did wrong and refused to obey the Lord .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Everything else Rehoboam did while he was king, including a history of his family, is written in the records of the two prophets, Shemaiah and Iddo. During Rehoboam's rule, he and King Jeroboam of Israel were constantly at war.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">When Rehoboam died, he was buried beside his ancestors in Jerusalem, and his son Abijah became king.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="13">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Abijah became king of Judah in Jeroboam's eighteenth year as king of Israel,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">and he ruled from Jerusalem for three years. His mother was Micaiah the daughter of Uriel from Gibeah. Some time later, Abijah and King Jeroboam of Israel went to war against each other. Listen, Jeroboam and all you Israelites!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Abijah's army had 400,000 troops, and Jeroboam met him in battle with 800,000 troops.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Abijah went to the top of Mount Zemaraim in the hills of Ephraim and shouted:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">The Lord God of Israel has made a solemn promise that every king of Israel will be from David's family.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">But Jeroboam, you were King Solomon's official, and you rebelled.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Then right after Rehoboam became king, you and your bunch of worthless followers challenged Rehoboam, who was too young to know how to stop you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Now you and your powerful army think you can stand up to the kingdom that the Lord has given to David's descendants. The only gods you have are those gold statues of calves that Jeroboam made for you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">You don't even have descendants of Aaron on your side, because you forced out the Lord 's priests and Levites. In their place, you appoint ordinary people to be priests, just as the foreign nations do. In fact, anyone who brings a bull and seven rams to the altar can become a priest of your so-called gods.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">But we have not turned our backs on the Lord God! Aaron's own descendants serve as our priests, and the Levites are their assistants.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Two times every day they offer sacrifices and burn incense to the Lord . They set out the sacred loaves of bread on a table that has been purified, and they light the lamps in the gold lampstand every day at sunset. We follow the commands of the Lord our God&amp;ndash;you have rejected him!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">That's why God is on our side and will lead us into battle when the priests sound the signal on the trumpets. It's no use, Israelites. You might as well give up. There's no way you can defeat the Lord , the God your ancestors worshiped.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">But while Abijah was talking, Jeroboam had sent some of his troops to attack Judah's army from behind, while the rest attacked from the front.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Judah's army realized they were trapped, and so they prayed to the Lord . The priests blew the signal on the trumpet,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">and the troops let out a battle cry. Then with Abijah leading them into battle, God defeated Jeroboam and Israel's army.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">The Israelites ran away, and God helped Judah's soldiers slaughter</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">500,000 enemy troops.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Judah's army won because they had trusted the Lord God of their ancestors.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Abijah kept up his attack on Jeroboam's army and captured the Israelite towns of Bethel, Jeshanah, and Ephron, as well as the villages around them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Jeroboam never regained his power during the rest of Abijah's rule. The Lord punished Jeroboam, and he died, but Abijah became more powerful.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Abijah had a total of 14 wives, 22 sons, and 16 daughters.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Everything Abijah said and did while he was king is written in the records of Iddo the prophet.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="14">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Abijah died and was buried in Jerusalem. Then his son Asa became king, and Judah had ten years of peace. Lord God, only you can help a powerless army defeat a stronger one. So we depend on you to help us. We will fight against this powerful army to honor your name, and we know that you won't be defeated. You are the Lord our God. The soldiers from Judah took everything that had belonged to the Ethiopians.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Asa obeyed the Lord his God and did right.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">He destroyed the local shrines and the altars to foreign gods. He smashed the stone images of gods and cut down the sacred poles used in worshiping the goddess Asherah.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Then he told everyone in Judah to worship the Lord God, just as their ancestors had done, and to obey his laws and teachings.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">He destroyed every local shrine and incense altar in Judah.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">The Lord blessed Judah with peace while Asa was king, and so during that time, Asa fortified many of the towns.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">He said to the people, &amp;apos;Let's build walls and defense towers for these towns, and put in gates that can be locked with bars. This land still belongs to us, because we have obeyed the Lord our God. He has given us peace from all our enemies.&amp;apos; The people did everything Asa had suggested.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Asa had a large army of brave soldiers: 300,000 of them were from the tribe of Judah and were armed with shields and spears; 280,000 were from Benjamin and were armed with shields and bows.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Zerah from Ethiopia led an army of 1,000,000 soldiers and 300 chariots to the town of Mareshah in Judah.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Asa met him there, and the two armies prepared for battle in Zephathah Valley.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Asa prayed:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">The Lord helped Asa and his army defeat the Ethiopians. The enemy soldiers ran away,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">but Asa and his troops chased them as far as Gerar. It was a total defeat&amp;ndash;the Ethiopians could not even fight back!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">The people who lived in the villages around Gerar learned what had happened and were afraid of the Lord . So Judah's army easily defeated them and carried off everything of value that they wanted from these towns.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">They also attacked the camps where the shepherds lived and took a lot of sheep, goats, and camels. Then they went back to Jerusalem.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="15">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Some time later, God spoke to Azariah son of Oded.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">At once, Azariah went to Asa and said: Listen to me, King Asa and you people of Judah and Benjamin. The Lord will be with you and help you, as long as you obey and worship him. But if you disobey him, he will desert you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">For a long time, the people of Israel did not worship the true God or listen to priests who could teach them about God. They refused to obey God's Law.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">But whenever trouble came, Israel turned back to the Lord their God and worshiped him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">There was so much confusion in those days that it wasn't safe to go anywhere in Israel.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Nations were destroying each other, and cities were wiping out other cities, because God was causing trouble and unrest everywhere.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">So you must be brave. Don't give up! God will honor you for obeying him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">As soon as Asa heard what Azariah the prophet said, he gave orders for all the idols in Judah and Benjamin to be destroyed, including those in the towns he had captured in the territory of Ephraim. He also repaired the Lord 's altar that was in front of the temple porch.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Asa called together the people from Judah and Benjamin, as well as the people from the territories of Ephraim, West Manasseh, and Simeon who were living in Judah. Many of these people were now loyal to Asa, because they had seen that the Lord was with him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">In the third month of the fifteenth year of Asa's rule, they all met in Jerusalem.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">That same day, they took 700 bulls and 7,000 sheep and goats from what they had brought back from Gerar and sacrificed them as offerings to the Lord .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">They made a solemn promise to faithfully worship the Lord God their ancestors had worshiped,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">and to put to death anyone who refused to obey him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">The crowd solemnly agreed to keep their promise to the Lord , then they celebrated by shouting and blowing trumpets and horns.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Everyone was happy because they had made this solemn promise, and in return, the Lord blessed them with peace from all their enemies.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Asa's grandmother Maacah had made a disgusting idol of the goddess Asherah, so he cut it down, crushed it, and burned it in Kidron Valley. Then he removed Maacah from her position as queen mother.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">As long as Asa lived, he was faithful to the Lord , even though he did not destroy the local shrines in Israel.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">He placed in the temple all the silver and gold objects that he and his father had dedicated to God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">There was peace in Judah until the thirty-fifth year of Asa's rule.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="16">
			<VERS vnumber="1">In the thirty-sixth year of Asa's rule, King Baasha of Israel invaded Judah and captured the town of Ramah. He started making the town stronger, and he put troops there to stop people from going in and out of Judah. You depended on the king of Syria instead of depending on the Lord your God. And so, you will never defeat the Syrian army.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">When Asa heard about this, he took the silver and gold from his palace and from the Lord 's temple. Then he sent it to Damascus with this message for King Benhadad of Syria:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">&amp;apos;I think we should sign a peace treaty, just as our fathers did. This silver and gold is a present for you. Would you please break your treaty with King Baasha of Israel and force him to leave my country?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Benhadad did what Asa asked and sent the Syrian army into Israel. They captured the towns of Ijon, Dan, Abel-Maim, and all the towns in Naphtali where supplies were kept.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">When Baasha heard about it, he stopped his work on the town of Ramah.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Asa ordered everyone in Judah to carry away the stones and wood Baasha had used to fortify Ramah. Then he fortified the towns of Geba and Mizpah with these same stones and wood.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Soon after that happened, Hanani the prophet went to Asa and said:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Remember how powerful the Ethiopian and Libyan army was, with all their chariots and cavalry troops! You trusted the Lord to help you then, and you defeated them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">The Lord is constantly watching everyone, and he gives strength to those who faithfully obey him. But you have done a foolish thing, and your kingdom will never be at peace again.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">When Asa heard this, he was so angry that he put Hanani in prison. Asa was also cruel to some of his people.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Everything Asa did while he was king is written in The History of the Kings of Judah and Israel .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">In the thirty-ninth year of his rule, he got a very bad foot disease, but he relied on doctors and refused to ask the Lord for help.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">He died two years later.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Earlier, Asa had his own tomb cut out of a rock hill in Jerusalem. So he was buried there, and the tomb was filled with spices and sweet-smelling oils. Then the people built a bonfire in his honor.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="17">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Jehoshaphat son of Asa became king and strengthened his defenses against Israel.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">He assigned troops to the fortified cities in Judah, as well as to other towns in Judah and to those towns in Ephraim that his father Asa had captured. Adnah was the commander of the troops from Judah, and he had 300,000 soldiers under his command.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">and helped him keep firm control of his kingdom. The people of Judah brought gifts to Jehoshaphat, but even after he became very rich and respected,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">he remained completely faithful to the Lord . He destroyed all the local shrines in Judah, including the places where the goddess Asherah was worshiped.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">In the third year of Jehoshaphat's rule, he chose five officials and gave them orders to teach the Lord 's Law in every city and town in Judah. They were Benhail, Obadiah, Zechariah, Nethanel, and Micaiah.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Their assistants were the following nine Levites: Shemaiah, Nethaniah, Zebadiah, Asahel, Shemiramoth, Jehonathan, Adonijah, Tobijah, and Tob-Adonijah. Two priests, Elishama and Jehoram, also went along.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">They carried with them a copy of the Lord 's Law wherever they went and taught the people from it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">The nations around Judah were afraid of the Lord 's power, so none of them attacked Jehoshaphat.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Philistines brought him silver and other gifts to keep peace. Some of the Arab people brought him 7,700 rams and the same number of goats.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">As Jehoshaphat became more powerful, he built fortresses and cities</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">where he stored supplies. He also kept in Jerusalem some experienced soldiers</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">from the Judah and Benjamin tribes. These soldiers were grouped according to their clans.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Jehohanan was second in command, with 280,000 soldiers under him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Amasiah son of Zichri, who had volunteered to serve the Lord , was third in command, with 200,000 soldiers under him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Eliada was a brave warrior who commanded the troops from Benjamin. He had 200,000 soldiers under his command, all of them armed with bows and shields.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Jehozabad was second in command, with 180,000 soldiers under him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">These were the troops who protected the king in Jerusalem, not counting those he had assigned to the fortified cities throughout the country.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="18">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Jehoshaphat was now very rich and famous. He signed a treaty with King Ahab of Israel by arranging the marriage of his son and Ahab's daughter. &amp;apos;Yes,&amp;apos; Jehoshaphat answered. &amp;apos;My army is at your command. &amp;apos;Yes!&amp;apos; the prophets answered. &amp;apos;God will help you capture the city.&amp;apos; &amp;apos;Don't say that!&amp;apos; Jehoshaphat replied. &amp;apos;Yes!&amp;apos; Micaiah answered. &amp;apos;The Lord will help you capture the city.&amp;apos; I then saw the Lord seated on his throne with every creature in heaven gathered around him. They talked about it for a while, &amp;apos;How?&amp;apos; the Lord asked. &amp;apos;Good!&amp;apos; the Lord replied. &amp;apos;Now go and do it. You will be successful.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">One day, Jehoshaphat went to visit Ahab in his capital city of Samaria. Ahab slaughtered sheep and cattle and prepared a big feast to honor Jehoshaphat and the officials with him. Ahab talked about attacking the city of Ramoth in Gilead,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">and finally asked, &amp;apos;Jehoshaphat, would you go with me to attack Ramoth?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">But first let's ask the Lord what to do.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Ahab sent for 400 prophets and asked, &amp;apos;Should I attack the city of Ramoth?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">But Jehoshaphat said, &amp;apos;Just to make sure, is there another of the Lord 's prophets we can ask?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">&amp;apos;We could ask Micaiah son of Imlah,&amp;apos; Ahab said. &amp;apos;But I hate Micaiah. He always has bad news for me.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Then Ahab sent someone to bring Micaiah as soon as possible.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">All this time, Ahab and Jehoshaphat were dressed in their royal robes and were seated on their thrones at the threshing place near the gate of Samaria, listening to the prophets tell them what the Lord had said.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Zedekiah son of Chenaanah was one of the prophets. He had made some horns out of iron and shouted, &amp;apos;Ahab, the Lord says you will attack the Syrians like a bull with iron horns and wipe them out!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">All the prophets agreed that Ahab should attack the Syrians at Ramoth and promised that the Lord would help him defeat them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Meanwhile, the messenger who went to get Micaiah whispered, &amp;apos;Micaiah, all the prophets have good news for Ahab. Now go and say the same thing.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">&amp;apos;I'll say whatever the living Lord my God tells me to say,&amp;apos; Micaiah replied.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Then Micaiah went up to Ahab, who asked, &amp;apos;Micaiah, should we attack Ramoth?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Ahab shouted, &amp;apos;Micaiah, I've told you over and over to tell me the truth! What does the Lord really say?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Micaiah answered, &amp;apos;In a vision I saw Israelite soldiers wandering around, lost in the hills like sheep without a shepherd. The Lord said, &amp;quot;These troops have no leader. They should go home and not fight.&amp;quot; &amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Ahab turned to Jehoshaphat and said, &amp;apos;I told you he would bring me bad news!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Micaiah replied:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">The Lord asked, &amp;apos;Who can trick Ahab and make him go to Ramoth where he will be killed?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">then finally a spirit came forward and said to the Lord , &amp;apos;I can trick Ahab.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">&amp;apos;I'll make Ahab's prophets lie to him.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Ahab, this is exactly what has happened. The Lord made all your prophets lie to you, and he knows you will soon be destroyed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">Zedekiah walked over and slapped Micaiah on the face. Then he asked, &amp;apos;Do you really think the Lord would speak to you and not to me?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">Micaiah answered, &amp;apos;You'll find out on the day you have to hide in the back room of some house.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">Ahab shouted, &amp;apos;Arrest Micaiah! Take him to Prince Joash and Governor Amon of Samaria.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">Tell them to put him in prison and to give him nothing but bread and water until I come back safely.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">Micaiah said, &amp;apos;If you do come back, I was wrong about what the Lord wanted me to say.&amp;apos; Then he told the crowd, &amp;apos;Don't forget what I said!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">Ahab and Jehoshaphat led their armies to Ramoth in Gilead.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">Before they went into battle, Ahab said, &amp;apos;Jehoshaphat, I'll disguise myself, but you wear your royal robe.&amp;apos; Ahab disguised himself and went into battle.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">The king of Syria had ordered his chariot commanders to attack only Ahab.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">So when they saw Jehoshaphat in his robe, they thought he was Ahab and started to attack him. But Jehoshaphat prayed, and the Lord made the Syrian soldiers stop.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">And when they realized he wasn't Ahab, they left him alone.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">However, during the fighting a soldier shot an arrow without even aiming, and it hit Ahab between two pieces of his armor. He shouted to his chariot driver, &amp;apos;I've been hit! Get me out of here!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">The fighting lasted all day, with Ahab propped up in his chariot so he could see the Syrian troops. He stayed there until evening, and by sundown he was dead.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="19">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Jehoshaphat returned safely to his palace in Jerusalem.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">But the prophet Jehu son of Hanani met him and said: By helping that wicked Ahab, you have made friends with someone who hates the Lord . Now the Lord God is angry with you! Be careful when you make your decisions in court, because you are judging by the Lord 's standards and not by human standards, and he will know what you decide. Faithfully serve the Lord !</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">But not everything about you is bad. You destroyed the sacred poles used in worshiping the goddess Asherah&amp;ndash;that shows you have tried to obey the Lord .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Jehoshaphat lived in Jerusalem, but he often traveled through his kingdom, from Beersheba in the south to the edge of the hill country of Ephraim in the north. He talked with the people and convinced them to turn back to the Lord God and worship him, just as their ancestors had done.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">He assigned judges to each of the fortified cities in Judah</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">and told them:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">So do your work in honor of him and know that he won't allow you to be unfair to anyone or to take bribes.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Jehoshaphat also chose some Levites, some priests, and some of the family leaders, and he appointed them to serve as judges in Jerusalem.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">He told them:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">The people of Judah will bring you legal cases that involve every type of crime, including murder. You must settle these cases and warn the people to stop sinning against the Lord , so that he won't get angry and punish Judah. Remember, if you follow these instructions, you won't be held responsible for anything that happens.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Amariah the high priest will have the final say in any religious case. And Zebadiah, the leader of the Judah tribe, will have the final say in all other cases. The rest of the Levites will serve as your assistants. Be brave, and I pray that the Lord will help you do right.</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="20">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Some time later, the armies of Moab and Ammon, together with the Meunites, went to war against Jehoshaphat.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Messengers told Jehoshaphat, &amp;apos;A large army from Edom east of the Dead Sea has invaded our country. They have already reached En-Gedi.&amp;apos; You, Lord , are the God our ancestors worshiped, and from heaven you rule every nation in the world. You are so powerful that no one can defeat you. Your Majesty and everyone from Judah and Jerusalem, the Lord says that you don't need to be afraid or let this powerful army discourage you. God will fight on your side! &amp;apos;Praise the Lord ! His love never ends.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Jehoshaphat was afraid, so he asked the Lord what to do. He then told the people of Judah to go without eating to show their sorrow.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">They immediately left for Jerusalem to ask for the Lord 's help.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">After everyone from Judah and Jerusalem had come together at the Lord 's temple, Jehoshaphat stood in front of the new courtyard</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">and prayed:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Our God, you forced out the nations who lived in this land before your people Israel came here, and you gave it to the descendants of your friend Abraham forever.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Our ancestors lived in this land and built a temple to honor you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">They believed that whenever this land is struck by war or disease or famine, your people can pray to you at the temple, and you will hear their prayer and save them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">You can see that the armies of Ammon, Moab, and Edom are attacking us! Those are the nations you would not let our ancestors invade on their way from Egypt, so these nations were not destroyed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Now they are coming to take back the land you gave us.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Aren't you going to punish them? We won't stand a chance when this army attacks. We don't know what to do&amp;ndash;we are begging for your help.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">While every man, woman, and child of Judah was standing there at the temple,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">the Lord 's Spirit suddenly spoke to Jahaziel, a Levite from the Asaph clan.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Then Jahaziel said:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">So here's what you must do. Tomorrow the enemy armies will march through the desert around the town of Jeruel. March down and meet them at the town of Ziz as they come up the valley.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">You won't even have to fight. Just take your positions and watch the Lord rescue you from your enemy. Don't be afraid. Just do as you're told. And as you march out tomorrow, the Lord will be there with you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Jehoshaphat bowed low to the ground and everyone worshiped the Lord .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Then some Levites from the Kohath and Korah clans stood up and shouted praises to the Lord God of Israel.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Early the next morning, as everyone got ready to leave for the desert near Tekoa, Jehoshaphat stood up and said, &amp;apos;Listen my friends, if we trust the Lord God and believe what these prophets have told us, the Lord will help us, and we will be successful.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Then he explained his plan and appointed men to march in front of the army and praise the Lord for his holy power by singing:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">As soon as they began singing, the Lord confused the enemy camp,</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1">Jehoshaphat died and was buried beside his ancestors in Jerusalem, and his son Jehoram became king. Those things happened because Jehoram had turned away from the Lord , the God his ancestors had worshiped. I have a message for you from the Lord God your ancestor David worshiped. He knows that you have not followed the example of Jehoshaphat your father or Asa your grandfather.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">King Jehoshaphat had seven sons: Jehoram, Azariah, Jehiel, Zechariah, Azariah, Michael, and Shephatiah.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Jehoshaphat gave each of them silver and gold, as well as other valuable gifts. He also put them in charge of the fortified cities in Judah, but he had chosen his oldest son Jehoram to succeed him as king.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="5">He was 32 years old when he became king, and he ruled eight years from Jerusalem.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Jehoram married Ahab's daughter and followed the sinful example of Ahab's family and the other kings of Israel. He disobeyed the Lord by doing wrong,</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="8">While Jehoram was king, the people of Edom rebelled and chose their own king.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Jehoram, his officers, and his cavalry marched to Edom, where the Edomite army surrounded them. He escaped during the night,</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1">Earlier, when the Arabs led a raid against Judah, they killed all of Jehoram's sons, except Ahaziah, the youngest one. So the people of Jerusalem crowned him their king.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">He was 22 years old at the time, and he ruled only one year from Jerusalem. Ahaziah's mother was Athaliah, a granddaughter of King Omri of Israel, Their advice led to his downfall. When Ahaziah arrived at Jezreel, he and Joram went to meet with Jehu grandson of Nimshi. The Lord had already told Jehu to kill every male in Ahab's family, There was no one from Ahaziah's family left to become king of Judah.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">and she encouraged her son to sin against the Lord . He followed the evil example of King Ahab and his descendants.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">In fact, after his father's death, Ahaziah sinned against the Lord by appointing some of Ahab's relatives to be his advisors.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">He listened to them and went with King Joram of Israel to attack King Hazael and the Syrian troops at Ramoth in Gilead. Joram was wounded in that battle,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">and he went to the town of Jezreel to recover. And Ahaziah later went there to visit him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">It was during that visit that God had Ahaziah put to death.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">and while Jehu was doing that, he saw some of Judah's leaders and Ahaziah's nephews who had come with Ahaziah. Jehu killed them on the spot,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">then gave orders to find Ahaziah. Jehu's officers found him hiding in Samaria. They brought Ahaziah to Jehu, who immediately put him to death. They buried Ahaziah only because they respected Jehoshaphat his grandfather, who had done his best to obey the Lord .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">As soon as Athaliah heard that her son King Ahaziah was dead, she decided to kill any relative who could possibly become king. She would have done just that,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">but Jehosheba rescued Joash son of Ahaziah just as the others were about to be murdered. Jehosheba, who was Jehoram's daughter and Ahaziah's half sister, was married to Jehoiada the priest. So she was able to hide her nephew Joash and his personal servant in a bedroom in the Lord 's temple where he was safe from Athaliah.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Joash hid in the temple with them for six years while Athaliah ruled as queen of Judah.</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="23">
			<VERS vnumber="1">After Ahaziah's son Joash had hidden in the temple for six years, Jehoiada the priest knew that something had to be done. So he made sure he had the support of several army officers. They were Azariah son of Jeroham, Ishmael son of Jehohanan, Azariah son of Obed, Maaseiah son of Adaiah, and Elishaphat son of Zichri.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">These five men went to the towns in Judah and called together the Levites and the clan leaders. They all came to Jerusalem</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">and gathered at the temple, where they agreed to help Joash. Jehoiada said to them: Joash will be our next king, because long ago the Lord promised that one of David's descendants would always be king.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Here is what we will do. Three groups of priests and Levites will be on guard duty on the Sabbath&amp;ndash;one group will guard the gates of the temple,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">one will guard the palace, and the other will guard Foundation Gate. The rest of you will stand guard in the temple courtyards.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Only the priests and Levites who are on duty will be able to enter the temple, because they will be the only ones who have gone through the ceremony to make themselves clean and acceptable. The others must stay outside in the courtyards, just as the Lord has commanded.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">You Levites must protect King Joash. Don't let him out of your sight! And keep your swords ready to kill anyone who comes into the temple.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">The Levites and the people of Judah followed Jehoiada's orders. The guards going off duty were not allowed to go home, and so each commander had all his guards available&amp;ndash;those going off duty as well as those coming on duty.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Jehoiada went into the temple and brought out the swords and shields that had belonged to King David, and he gave them to the commanders.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">They gave the weapons to the guards, and Jehoiada then made sure that the guards took their positions around the temple and the altar to protect the king on every side.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Jehoiada and his sons brought Joash outside, where they placed the crown on his head and gave him a copy of the instructions for ruling the nation. Olive oil was poured on his head to show that he was now king, and the crowd cheered and shouted, &amp;apos;Long live the king!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">As soon as Queen Athaliah heard the crowd cheering for Joash, she went to the temple.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">There she saw Joash standing by one of the columns near the entrance, which was the usual place for the king. The commanders and the trumpet players were standing next to him, and the musicians were playing instruments and leading the people as they celebrated and blew trumpets. Athaliah tore her clothes in anger and shouted, &amp;apos;You betrayed me, you traitors!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">At once, Jehoiada said to the army commanders, &amp;apos;Don't kill her near the Lord 's temple. Take her out in front of the troops, and be sure to kill all of her followers!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">She tried to escape, but the commanders caught and killed her near the gate where horses are led into the palace.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Jehoiada asked King Joash and the people to join with him in being faithful to the Lord . They agreed,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">then rushed to the temple of the god Baal and tore it down. They smashed the altars and the idols and killed Mattan the priest of Baal in front of the altars.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Jehoiada assigned the priests and Levites their duties at the temple, just as David had done. They were in charge of offering sacrifices to the Lord according to the Law of Moses, and they were responsible for leading the celebrations with singing.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Jehoiada ordered the guards at the temple gates to keep out anyone who was unclean.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Finally, Jehoiada called together the army commanders, the most important citizens of Judah, and the government officials. The crowd of people followed them as they led Joash from the temple, through the Upper Gate, and into the palace, where he took his place as king of Judah.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Everyone celebrated because Athaliah had been killed and Jerusalem was peaceful again.</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="24">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Joash was only 7 years old when he became king of Judah, and he ruled 40 years from Jerusalem. His mother Zibiah was from the town of Beersheba. But the Levites were in no hurry to follow the king's orders. This happened day after day, and soon a large amount of money was collected.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">While Jehoiada the priest was alive, Joash obeyed the Lord by doing right.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Jehoiada even chose two women for Joash to marry so he could have a family.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Some time later, Joash decided it was time to repair the temple.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">He called together the priests and Levites and said, &amp;apos;Go everywhere in Judah and collect the annual tax from the people. I want this done at once&amp;ndash;we need that money to repair the temple.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">So he sent for Jehoiada the high priest and asked, &amp;apos;Why didn't you send the Levites to collect the taxes? The Lord 's servant Moses and the people agreed long ago that this tax would be collected and used to pay for the upkeep of the sacred tent.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">And now we need it to repair the temple because the sons of that evil woman Athaliah came in and wrecked it. They even used some of the sacred objects to worship the god Baal.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Joash gave orders for a wooden box to be made and had it placed outside, near the gate of the temple.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">He then sent letters everywhere in Judah and Jerusalem, asking everyone to bring their taxes to the temple, just as Moses had required their ancestors to do.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">The people and their leaders agreed, and they brought their money to Jerusalem and placed it in the box.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Each day, after the Levites took the box into the temple, the king's secretary and the high priest's assistant would dump out the money and count it. Then the empty box would be taken back outside.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Joash and Jehoiada turned the money over to the men who were supervising the repairs to the temple. They used the money to hire stonecutters, carpenters, and experts in working with iron and bronze.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">These workers went right to work repairing the temple, and when they were finished, it looked as good as new.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">They did not use all the tax money for the repairs, so the rest of it was handed over to Joash and Jehoiada, who then used it to make dishes and other gold and silver objects for the temple. Sacrifices to please the Lord were offered regularly in the temple for as long as Jehoiada lived.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">He died at the ripe old age of 130 years,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">and he was buried in the royal tombs in Jerusalem, because he had done so much good for the people of Israel, for God, and for the temple.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">After the death of Jehoiada the priest, the leaders of Judah went to Joash and talked him into doing what they wanted.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">The people of Judah soon stopped worshiping in the temple of the Lord God and started worshiping idols and the symbols of the goddess Asherah. These sinful things made the Lord God angry with the people of Judah and Jerusalem,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">but he still sent prophets who warned them to turn back to him. The people refused to listen.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">God's Spirit spoke to Zechariah son of Jehoiada the priest, and Zechariah told everyone that God was saying: &amp;apos;Why are you disobeying me and my laws? This will only bring punishment! You have deserted me, so now I will desert you.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">In the spring of the following year, the Syrian army invaded Judah and Jerusalem, killing all of the nation's leaders. They collected everything of value that belonged to the people and took it back to their king in Damascus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">The Syrian army was very small, but the Lord let them defeat Judah's large army, because he was punishing Joash and the people of Judah for turning away from him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">The History of the Kings also tells more about the sons of Joash, what the prophets said about him, and how he repaired the temple. Amaziah son of Joash became king after his father's death.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="25">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Amaziah was 25 years old when he became king, and he ruled 29 years from Jerusalem, the hometown of his mother Jehoaddin. &amp;apos;The Lord will give you back even more than you paid,&amp;apos; the prophet answered. The prophet stopped. But then he added, &amp;apos;First you sinned and now you've ignored my warning. It's clear that God has decided to punish you!&amp;apos; Once upon a time, a small thornbush in Lebanon arranged the marriage between his son and the daughter of a large cedar tree. But a wild animal came along and trampled the small bush. Jehoash took Amaziah with him when he went to attack Jerusalem. Jehoash broke down the city wall from Ephraim Gate to Corner Gate, a section nearly 200 meters long.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Even though Amaziah obeyed the Lord by doing right, he refused to be completely faithful.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">For example, as soon as he had control of Judah, he arrested and killed the officers who had murdered his father.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">But the children of those officers were not killed; the Lord had commanded in the Law of Moses that only the people who sinned were to be punished.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Amaziah sent a message to the tribes of Judah and Benjamin and called together all the men who were 20 years old and older. Three hundred thousand men went to Jerusalem, all of them ready for battle and able to fight with spears and shields. Amaziah grouped these soldiers according to their clans and put them under the command of his army officers.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Amaziah also paid about 3.4 tons of silver to hire 100,000 soldiers from Israel.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">One of God's prophets said, &amp;apos;Your Majesty, don't let these Israelite soldiers march into battle with you. The Lord has refused to help anyone from the northern kingdom of Israel,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">and so he will let your enemies defeat you, even if you fight hard. He is the one who brings both victory and defeat.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Amaziah replied, &amp;apos;What am I supposed to do about all the silver I paid those troops?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Amaziah ordered the troops from Israel to go home, but when they left, they were furious with the people of Judah.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">After Amaziah got his courage back, he led his troops to Salt Valley, where he killed 10,000 Edomite soldiers in battle.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">He captured 10,000 more soldiers and dragged them to the top of a high cliff. Then he pushed them over the side, and they all were killed on the rocks below.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Meanwhile, the Israelite troops that Amaziah had sent home, raided the towns in Judah between Samaria and Beth-Horon. They killed 3,000 people and carried off their possessions.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">After Amaziah had defeated the Edomite army, he returned to Jerusalem. He took with him the idols of the Edomite gods and set them up. Then he bowed down and offered them sacrifices.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">This made the Lord very angry, and he sent a prophet to ask Amaziah, &amp;apos;Why would you worship these foreign gods that couldn't even save their own people from your attack?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">But before the prophet finished speaking, Amaziah interrupted and said, &amp;apos;You're not one of my advisors! Don't say another word, or I'll have you killed.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">King Amaziah of Judah talked with his officials, then sent a message to King Jehoash of Israel: &amp;apos;Come out and face me in battle!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Jehoash sent back a reply that said:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Amaziah, you think you're so powerful because you defeated Edom. But stay at home and do your celebrating. If you cause any trouble, both you and your kingdom of Judah will be destroyed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">God made Amaziah stubborn because he was planning to punish him for worshiping the Edomite gods. Amaziah refused to listen to Jehoash's warning,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">so Jehoash led his army to the town of Beth-Shemesh in Judah to attack Amaziah and his troops.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">During the battle, Judah's army was crushed. Every soldier from Judah ran back home,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">and Jehoash captured Amaziah.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">He carried away the gold, the silver, and all the valuable furnishings from God's temple where the descendants of Obed-Edom stood guard. He robbed the king's treasury, took hostages, then returned to Samaria.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">Amaziah lived 15 years after Jehoash died.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">Everything else Amaziah did while he was king is written in The History of the Kings of Judah and Israel .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">As soon as Amaziah started disobeying the Lord , some people in Jerusalem plotted against Amaziah. He was able to escape to the town of Lachish, but another group of people caught him and killed him there.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="4">He obeyed the Lord by doing right, as his father Amaziah had done.</VERS>

Ahaz disobeyed the Lord The Lord God of your ancestors let you defeat Judah's army only because he was angry with them. But you should not have been so cruel! If you bring these prisoners into Samaria, that will be one more thing we've done to sin against the Lord . And he is already angry enough with us. Ahaz sent a message to King Tiglath Pileser of Assyria and begged for help.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">and was as sinful as the kings of Israel. He made idols of the god Baal,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">and he offered sacrifices in Hinnom Valley. Worst of all, Ahaz sacrificed his own sons, which was a disgusting custom of the nations that the Lord had forced out of Israel.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Ahaz offered sacrifices at the local shrines, as well as on every hill and in the shade of large trees.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">During that battle, an Israelite soldier named Zichri killed three men from Judah: Maaseiah the king's son; Azrikam, the official in charge of the palace; and Elkanah, the king's second in command.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">The Israelite troops captured 200,000 women and children and took them back to their capital city of Samaria, along with a large amount of their possessions. They did these things even though the people of Judah were their own relatives.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Oded lived in Samaria and was one of the Lord 's prophets. He met Israel's army on their way back from Judah and said to them:</VERS>

They later gave them all a new change of clothes and shoes, then fixed them something to eat and drink, and cleaned their wounds with olive oil. They gave donkeys to those who were too weak to walk, and led all of them back to Jericho, the city known for its palm trees. The leaders then returned to Samaria.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="24">Ahaz collected all the furnishings of the temple and smashed them to pieces. Then he locked the doors to the temple and set up altars to foreign gods on every street corner in Jerusalem.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">In every city and town in Judah he built local shrines to worship foreign gods. All of this made the Lord God of his ancestors very angry.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">Everything else Ahaz did while he was king is written in The History of the Kings of Judah and Israel .</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1">Hezekiah was 25 years old when he became king of Judah, and he ruled 29 years from Jerusalem. His mother was Abijah daughter of Zechariah.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Hezekiah obeyed the Lord by doing right, just as his ancestor David had done. It's time to purify the temple of the Lord God of our ancestors. You Levites must first go through the ceremony to make yourselves clean, then go into the temple and bring out everything that is unclean and unacceptable to the Lord . Mahath son of Amasai and Joel son of Azariah from the Kohath clan; Kish son of Abdi and Azariah son of Jehallelel from the Merari clan; Joah son of Zimmah and Eden son of Joah from the Gershon clan; Shimri and Jeuel from the Elizaphan clan; Zechariah and Mattaniah from the Asaph clan; Jehuel and Shimei from the Heman clan; Shemaiah and Uzziel from the Jeduthun clan. Your Majesty, we have finished our work. The entire temple is now pure again, and so is the altar and its utensils, as well as the table for the sacred loaves of bread and its utensils. The people did this, and some of them voluntarily brought animals to be offered as sacrifices. So the temple was once again used for worshiping the Lord .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">In the first month of the first year of Hezekiah's rule, he unlocked the doors to the Lord 's temple and had them repaired.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Then he called the priests and Levites to the east courtyard of the temple</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">and said:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Some of our ancestors were unfaithful and disobeyed the Lord our God. Not only did they turn their backs on the Lord , but they also completely ignored his temple.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">They locked the doors, then let the lamps go out and stopped burning incense and offering sacrifices to him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">The Lord became terribly angry with the people of Judah and Jerusalem, and everyone was shocked and horrified at what he did to punish them. Not only were</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">our ancestors killed in battle, but our own children and wives were taken captive.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">So I have decided to renew our agreement with the Lord God of Israel. Maybe then he will stop being so angry with us.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Let's not waste any time, my friends. You are the ones who were chosen to be the Lord 's priests and to offer him sacrifices.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">These leaders gathered together the rest of the Levites, and they all went through the ceremony to make themselves clean. Then they began to purify the temple according to the Law of the Lord , just as Hezekiah had commanded.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">The priests went into the temple and carried out everything that was unclean. They put these things in the courtyard, and from there, the Levites carried them outside the city to Kidron Valley.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">The priests and Levites began their work on the first day of the first month. It took them one week to purify the courtyards of the temple and another week to purify the temple. So on the sixteenth day of that same month</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">they went back to Hezekiah and said:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">And we have brought back all the things that King Ahaz took from the temple during the time he was unfaithful to God. We purified them and put them back in front of the altar.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">At once, Hezekiah called together the officials of Jerusalem, and they went to the temple.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">They brought with them seven bulls, seven rams, seven lambs, and seven goats as sacrifices to take away the sins of Hezekiah's family and of the people of Judah, as well as to purify the temple. Hezekiah told the priests, who were descendants of Aaron, to sacrifice these animals on the altar.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">The priests killed the bulls, the rams, and the lambs, then splattered the blood on the altar.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">They took the goats to Hezekiah and the worshipers, and they laid their hands on the animals.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">The priests then killed the goats and splattered the blood on the altar as a sacrifice to take away the sins of everyone in Israel, because Hezekiah had commanded that these sacrifices be made for all the people of Israel.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">Next, Hezekiah assigned the Levites to their places in the temple. He gave them cymbals, harps, and other stringed instruments, according to the instructions that the Lord had given King David and the two prophets, Gad and Nathan.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">The Levites were ready to play the instruments that had belonged to David; the priests were ready to blow the trumpets.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">As soon as Hezekiah gave the signal for the sacrifices to be burned on the altar, the musicians began singing praises to the Lord and playing their instruments,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">and everyone worshiped the Lord . This continued until the last animal was sacrificed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">After that, Hezekiah and the crowd of worshipers bowed down and worshiped the Lord .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">Then Hezekiah and his officials ordered the Levites to sing the songs of praise that David and Asaph the prophet had written. And so they bowed down and joyfully sang praises to the Lord .</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="32">Seventy bulls, 100 rams, and 200 lambs were brought as sacrifices to please the Lord ;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">600 bulls and 3,000 sheep were brought as sacrifices to ask the Lord 's blessing.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">There were not enough priests to skin all these animals, because many of the priests had not taken the time to go through the ceremony to make themselves clean. However, since all the Levites had made themselves clean, they helped the priests until the last animal was skinned.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">Besides all the sacrifices that were burned on the altar, the fat from the other animal sacrifices was burned, and the offerings of wine were poured over the altar.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">Hezekiah and the people of Judah celebrated, because God had helped them make this happen so quickly.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="5">Everyone from Beersheba in the south to Dan in the north was invited. This was the largest crowd of people that had ever celebrated Passover, according to the official records.</VERS>

If you do this, he will stop being angry.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Don't follow the example of your ancestors and your Israelite relatives in the north. They were unfaithful to the Lord , and he punished them horribly.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Don't be stubborn like your ancestors. Decide now to obey the Lord our God! Come to Jerusalem and worship him in the temple that will belong to him forever. Then he will stop being angry,</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="10">The messengers went to every town in Ephraim and West Manasseh as far north as the territory of Zebulun, but people laughed and insulted them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Only a few people from the tribes of Asher, West Manasseh, and Zebulun were humble and went to Jerusalem.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">God also made everyone in Judah eager to do what Hezekiah and his officials had commanded.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">In the second month, a large crowd of people gathered in Jerusalem to celebrate the Festival of Thin Bread.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="23">Everyone was so excited that they agreed to celebrate seven more days.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">So Hezekiah gave the people 1,000 bulls and 7,000 sheep to be offered as sacrifices and to be used as food for the sacred meals. His officials gave 1,000 bulls and 10,000 sheep, and many more priests agreed to go through the ceremony to make themselves clean.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="2">Hezekiah divided the priests and Levites into groups, according to their duties. Then he assigned them the responsibilities of offering sacrifices to please the Lord and sacrifices to ask his blessing. He also appointed people to serve at the temple and to sing praises at the temple gates.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Hezekiah provided animals from his own herds and flocks to use for the morning and evening sacrifices, as well as for the sacrifices during the Sabbath celebrations, the New Moon Festivals, and the other religious feasts required by the Law of the Lord .</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1">After King Hezekiah had faithfully obeyed the Lord 's instructions by doing these things, King Sennacherib of Assyria invaded Judah. He attacked the fortified cities and thought he would capture every one of them. He gave orders to make a large supply of weapons and shields, These words encouraged the army of Judah. Sennacherib returned to Assyria, completely disgraced. Then one day he went into the temple of his god where some of his sons killed him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">As soon as Hezekiah learned that Sennacherib was planning to attack Jerusalem,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Hezekiah's workers also repaired the broken sections of the city wall. Then they built defense towers and an outer wall to help protect the one already there. The landfill on the east side of David's City was also strengthened.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">and he appointed army commanders over the troops. Then he gathered the troops together in the open area in front of the city gate and said to them:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Be brave and confident! There's no reason to be afraid of King Sennacherib and his powerful army. We are much more powerful,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">because the Lord our God fights on our side. The Assyrians must rely on human power alone.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">When Sennacherib and his troops were camped at the town of Lachish, he sent a message to Hezekiah and the people in Jerusalem. It said:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">I am King Sennacherib of Assyria, and I have Jerusalem surrounded. Do you think you can survive my attack?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Hezekiah your king is telling you that the Lord your God will save you from me. But he is lying, and you'll die of hunger and thirst.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Didn't Hezekiah tear down all except one of the Lord 's altars and places of worship? And didn't he tell you people of Jerusalem and Judah to worship at that one place?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">You've heard what my ancestors and I have done to other nations. Were the gods of those nations able to defend their land against us?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">None of those gods kept their people safe from the kings of Assyria. Do you really think your God can do any better?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Don't be fooled by Hezekiah! No god of any nation has ever been able to stand up to Assyria. Believe me, your God cannot keep you safe!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">The Assyrian officials said terrible things about the Lord God and his servant Hezekiah.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Sennacherib's letter even made fun of the Lord . It said, &amp;apos;The gods of other nations could not save their people from Assyria's army, and neither will the God that Hezekiah worships.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">The officials said all these things in Hebrew, so that everyone listening from the city wall would understand and be terrified and surrender.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">The officials talked about the Lord God as if he were nothing but an ordinary god or an idol that someone had made.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Hezekiah and the prophet Isaiah son of Amoz begged the Lord for help,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">and he sent an angel that killed every soldier and commander in the Assyrian camp.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">The Lord rescued Hezekiah and the people of Jerusalem from Sennacherib and also protected them from other enemies.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">People brought offerings to Jerusalem for the Lord and expensive gifts for Hezekiah, and from that day on, every nation on earth respected Hezekiah.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">About this same time, Hezekiah got sick and was almost dead. He prayed, and the Lord gave him a sign that he would recover.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">But Hezekiah was so proud that he refused to thank the Lord for everything he had done for him. This made the Lord angry, and he punished Hezekiah and the people of Judah and Jerusalem.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">Hezekiah and the people later felt sorry and asked the Lord to forgive them. So the Lord did not punish them as long as Hezekiah was king.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">Hezekiah was very rich, and everyone respected him. He built special rooms to store the silver, the gold, the precious stones and spices, the shields, and the other valuable possessions.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">Storehouses were also built for his supply of grain, wine, and olive oil; barns were built for his cattle, and pens were put up for his sheep.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">God made Hezekiah extremely rich, so he bought even more sheep, goats, and cattle. And he built towns where he could keep all these animals.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="31">Even when the leaders of Babylonia sent messengers to ask Hezekiah about the sign God had given him, God let Hezekiah give his own answer to test him and to see if he would remain faithful.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">Everything else Hezekiah did while he was king, including how faithful he was to the Lord , is included in the records kept by Isaiah the prophet. These are written in The History of the Kings of Judah and Israel .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">When Hezekiah died, he was buried in the section of the royal tombs that was reserved for the most respected kings, and everyone in Judah and Jerusalem honored him. His son Manasseh then became king.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="3">He rebuilt the local shrines that his father Hezekiah had torn down. He built altars for the god Baal and set up sacred poles for worshiping the goddess Asherah. And he continued to worship the stars. Years ago, God had told David and Solomon: Jerusalem is the place I prefer above all others in Israel. It belongs to me, and there in the temple I will be worshiped forever.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">In the temple, where only the Lord was supposed to be worshiped, Manasseh built altars for the worship of pagan gods</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">and the stars. He placed these altars in both courtyards of the temple</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">If my people will faithfully obey all the laws and teaching I gave to my servant Moses, I will never again force them to leave the land I gave to their ancestors.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">But the people of Judah and Jerusalem listened to Manasseh and did even more sinful things than the nations the Lord had wiped out.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">The Lord tried to warn Manasseh and the people about their sins, but they ignored the warning.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">So he let Assyrian army commanders invade Judah and capture Manasseh. They put a hook in his nose and tied him up in chains, and they took him to Babylon.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">While Manasseh was held captive there, he asked the Lord God to forgive him and to help him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">The Lord listened to Manasseh's prayer and saw how sorry he was, and so he let him go back to Jerusalem and rule as king. Manasseh knew from then on that the Lord was God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Later, Manasseh rebuilt the eastern section of Jerusalem's outer wall and made it taller. This section went from Gihon Valley north to Fish Gate and around the part of the city called Mount Ophel. He also assigned army officers to each of the fortified cities in Judah.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Manasseh also removed the idols and the stone image of the foreign god from the temple, and he gathered the altars he had built near the temple and in other parts of Jerusalem. He threw all these things outside the city.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Then he repaired the Lord 's altar and offered sacrifices to thank him and sacrifices to ask his blessing. He gave orders that everyone in Judah must worship the Lord God of Israel.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">The people obeyed Manasseh, but they worshiped the Lord at their own shrines.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="19">Hozai wrote a lot about Manasseh, including his prayer and God's answer. But Hozai also recorded the evil things Manasseh did before turning back to God, as well as a list of places where Manasseh set up idols, and where he built local shrines and places to worship Asherah.</VERS>

Then Josiah went back to Jerusalem. You were sent here by King Josiah, and this is what the Lord God of Israel says to him: The men left and reported to Josiah what Huldah had said.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">When Josiah was only 16 years old he began worshiping God, just as his ancestor David had done. Then, 4 years later, he decided to destroy the local shrines in Judah and Jerusalem, as well as the sacred poles for worshiping the goddess Asherah and the idols of foreign gods.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">He watched as the altars for the worship of the god Baal were torn down, and as the nearby incense altars were smashed. The Asherah poles, the idols, and the stone images were also smashed, and the pieces were scattered over the graves of their worshipers.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Josiah then had the bones of the pagan priests burned on the altars.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">He did the same things in the towns and ruined villages in the territories of West Manasseh, Ephraim, and Simeon, as far as the border of Naphtali.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Everywhere in the northern kingdom of Israel, Josiah tore down pagan altars and Asherah poles; he crushed idols to dust and smashed incense altars.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">In the eighteenth year of Josiah's rule in Judah, after he had removed all the sinful things from the land and from the Lord 's temple, he sent three of his officials to repair the temple. They were Shaphan son of Azaliah, Governor Maaseiah of Jerusalem, and Joah son of Joahaz, who kept the government records.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">These three men went to Hilkiah the high priest. They gave him the money that the Levite guards had collected from the people of West Manasseh, Ephraim, and the rest of Israel, as well as those living in Judah, Benjamin, and Jerusalem.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Then the money was turned over to the men who supervised the repairs to the temple. They used some of it to pay the workers,</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="12">The workers were honest, and their supervisors were Jahath and Obadiah from the Levite clan of Merari, and Zechariah and Meshullam from the Levite clan of Kohath. Other Levites, who were all skilled musicians,</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1">Josiah commanded that Passover be celebrated in Jerusalem to honor the Lord . So, on the fourteenth day of the first month, the lambs were killed for the Passover celebration. No longer will you have to carry the sacred chest from place to place. It will stay in the temple built by King Solomon son of David, where you will serve the Lord and his people Israel. I'm not attacking you, king of Judah! We're not even at war. But God has told me to quickly attack my enemy. God is on my side, so if you try to stop me, he will punish you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">On that day, Josiah made sure the priests knew what duties they were to do in the temple.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="9">Conaniah, his two brothers Shemaiah and Nethanel, as well as Hashabiah, Jeiel, and Jozabad were leaders of the Levites, and they gave the other Levites 5,000 sheep and goats, and 500 bulls to offer as sacrifices.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">When everything was ready to celebrate Passover, the priests and the Levites stood where Josiah had told them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Then the Levites killed and skinned the Passover lambs, and they handed some of the blood to the priests, who splattered it on the altar.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">The Levites set aside the parts of the animal that the worshipers needed for their sacrifices to please the Lord , just as the Law of Moses required. They also did the same thing with the bulls.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">They sacrificed the Passover animals on the altar and boiled the meat for the other offerings in pots, kettles, and pans. Then they quickly handed the meat to the people so they could eat it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">All day long, the priests were busy offering sacrifices and burning the animals' fat on the altar. And when everyone had finished, the Levites prepared Passover animals for themselves and for the priests.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">During the celebration some of the Levites prepared Passover animals for the musicians and the guards, so that the Levite musicians would not have to leave their places, which had been assigned to them according to the instructions of David, Asaph, Heman, and Jeduthun the king's prophet. Even the guards at the temple gates did not have to leave their posts.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">So on that day, Passover was celebrated to honor the Lord , and sacrifices were offered on the altar to him, just as Josiah had commanded.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">The worshipers then celebrated the Festival of Thin Bread for the next seven days.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">People from Jerusalem and from towns all over Judah and Israel were there. Passover had not been observed like this since the days of Samuel the prophet. In fact, this was the greatest Passover celebration in Israel's history!</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="3">King Neco of Egypt captured Jehoahaz and forced Judah to pay 3.4 tons of silver and 34 kilograms of gold as taxes.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Then Neco appointed Jehoahaz's brother Eliakim king of Judah and changed his name to Jehoiakim. He led Jehoahaz away to Egypt as his prisoner. I am King Cyrus of Persia.

			<VERS vnumber="13">King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylonia had forced Zedekiah to promise in God's name that he would be loyal. Zedekiah was stubborn and refused to turn back to the Lord God of Israel, so he rebelled against Nebuchadnezzar.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">The people of Judah and even the priests who were their leaders became more unfaithful. They followed the disgusting example of the nations around them and made the Lord 's holy temple unfit for worship.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">But the Lord God felt sorry for his people, and instead of destroying the temple, he sent prophets who warned the people over and over about their sins.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">But the people only laughed and insulted these prophets. They ignored what the Lord God was trying to tell them, until he finally became so angry that nothing could stop him from punishing Judah and Jerusalem.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">The Lord sent King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylonia to attack Jerusalem. Nebuchadnezzar killed the young men who were in the temple, and he showed no mercy to anyone, whether man or woman, young or old. God let him kill everyone in the city.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="7">King Cyrus of Persia had said the Israelites could have cedar trees brought from Lebanon to Joppa by sea. So they sent grain, wine, and olive oil to the cities of Tyre and Sidon as payment for these trees, and they gave money to the stoneworkers and carpenters.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">During the second month of the second year after the people had returned from Babylonia, they started rebuilding the Lord 's temple. Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, Joshua son of Jozadak, the priests, the Levites, and everyone else who had returned started working. Every Levite over 20 years of age was put in charge of some part of the work.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1">The enemies of the tribes of Judah and Benjamin heard that the people had come back to rebuild the temple of the Lord God of Israel.</VERS>

Ever since King Esarhaddon of Assyria brought us here, we have worshiped your God and offered sacrifices to him.&amp;apos; Your Majesty King Artaxerxes, we are your servants from everywhere in Western Province, and we send you our greetings. Greetings to Governor Rehum, Secretary Shimshai, and to your advisors in Samaria and other parts of Western Province.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">But Zerubbabel, Joshua, and the family leaders answered, &amp;apos;You cannot take part in building a temple for the Lord our God! We will build it ourselves, just as King Cyrus of Persia commanded us.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Then the neighboring people began to do everything possible to frighten the Jews and to make them stop building.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">During the time that Cyrus was king and even until Darius became king, they kept bribing government officials to slow down the work.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">In the first year that Xerxes was king, the neighboring people brought written charges against the people of Judah and Jerusalem.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Later, Bishlam, Mithredath, Tabeel, and their advisors got together and wrote a letter to Artaxerxes when he was king of Persia. It was written in Aramaic and had to be translated.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="12">You should know that the Jews who left your country have moved back to Jerusalem and are now rebuilding that rebellious city. In fact, they have almost finished rebuilding the walls and repairing the foundations.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">You should also know that if the walls are completed and the city is rebuilt, the Jews won't pay any kind of taxes, and there will be less money in your treasury.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">We are telling you this, because you have done so much for us, and we want everyone to respect you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">If you look up the official records of your ancestors, you will find that Jerusalem has constantly rebelled and has led others to rebel against kings and provinces. That's why the city was destroyed in the first place.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">If Jerusalem is rebuilt and its walls completed, you will no longer have control over Western Province.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">King Artaxerxes answered:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">After your letter was translated and read to me,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">I had the old records checked. It is true that for years Jerusalem has rebelled and caused trouble for other kings and nations.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="21">I want you to command the people to stop rebuilding the city until I give further notice.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Do this at once, so that no harm will come to the kingdom.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">As soon as this letter was read, Governor Rehum, Secretary Shimshai, and their advisors went to Jerusalem and forced everyone to stop rebuilding the city.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="5">But God was looking after the Jewish leaders. So the governor and his group decided not to make the people stop working on the temple until they could report to Darius and get his advice.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Governor Tattenai, Shethar Bozenai, and their advisors sent a report to Darius,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">which said:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">We went to Judah, where the temple of the great God is being built with huge stones and wooden beams set in the walls. Everyone is working hard, and the building is going up quickly.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="5">Then the gold and silver things that Nebuchadnezzar took from the temple and brought to Babylonia are to be returned to their proper places.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">King Darius sent this message:</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="11">If any of you don't obey this order, a wooden beam will be taken from your house and sharpened on one end. Then it will be driven through your body, and your house will be torn down and turned into a garbage dump.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">I ask the God who is worshiped in Jerusalem to destroy any king or nation who tries either to change what I have said or to tear down his temple. I, Darius, give these orders, and I expect them to be followed carefully.</VERS>

You belong to the Lord , the God of your ancestors, and these things also belong to him. The silver and gold were willingly given as gifts to the Lord .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">I brought everyone together by the river that flows to the town of Ahava where we camped for three days. Not one Levite could be found among the people and priests.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">So I sent for the leaders Eliezer, Ariel, Shemaiah, Elnathan, Jarib, Elnathan, Nathan, Zechariah, and Meshullam. I also sent for Joiarib and Elnathan, who were very wise counselors.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Then I sent them to Iddo, the leader at Casiphia, and I told them to ask him and his temple workers to send people to serve in God's temple.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="22">I was ashamed to ask the king to send soldiers and cavalry to protect us against enemies along the way. After all, we had told the king that our God takes care of everyone who truly worships him, but that he gets very angry and punishes anyone who refuses to obey.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">So we went without food and asked God himself to protect us, and he answered our prayers.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="30">The priests and Levites then took charge of the gifts that had been weighed, so they could take them to the temple of our God in Jerusalem.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="36">Some of those who had returned took the king's orders to the governors and officials in Western Province. Then the officials did what they could for the people and for the temple of God.</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="9">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Later the Jewish leaders came to me and said: Many Israelites, including priests and Levites, are living just like the people around them. They are even guilty of some of the horrible sins of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Jebusites, the Ammonites, the Moabites, the Egyptians, and the Amorites. I am much too ashamed to face you, Lord God. Our sins and our guilt have swept over us like a flood that reaches up to the heavens. Your prophets also told us never to help those foreigners or even let them live in peace. You wanted us to become strong and to enjoy the good things in the land, then someday to leave it to our children forever.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Some Israelite men have married foreign women and have let their sons do the same thing. Our own officials and leaders were the first to commit this disgusting sin, and now God's holy people are mixed with foreigners.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">This news made me so angry that I ripped my clothes and tore hair from my head and beard. Then I just sat in shock</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">until the time for the evening sacrifice. Many of our people were greatly concerned and gathered around me, because the God of Israel had warned us to stay away from foreigners.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">At the time of the evening sacrifice, I was still sitting there in sorrow with my clothes all torn. So I got down on my knees, then lifted my arms,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">and prayed:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Since the time of our ancestors, all of us have sinned. That's why we, our kings, and our priests have often been defeated by other kings. They have killed some of us and made slaves of others; they have taken our possessions and made us ashamed, just as we are today.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">But for now, Lord God, you have shown great kindness to us. You made us truly happy by letting some of us settle in this sacred place and by helping us in our time of slavery.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">We are slaves, but you have never turned your back on us. You love us, and because of you, the kings of Persia have helped us. It's as though you have given us new life! You let us rebuild your temple and live safely in Judah and Jerusalem.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Our God, what can we say now? Even after all this, we have disobeyed the commands</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">that were given to us by your servants the prophets. They said the land you are giving us is full of sinful and wicked people, who never stop doing disgusting things.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">And we were warned not to let our daughters and sons marry their sons and daughters.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">You punished us because of our terrible sins. But you did not punish us nearly as much as we deserve, and you have brought some of us back home.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Why should we disobey your commands again by letting our sons and daughters marry these foreigners who do such disgusting things? That would make you angry enough to destroy us all!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Lord God of Israel, you have been more than fair by letting a few of us survive. But once again, our sins have made us ashamed to face you.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1">While Ezra was down on his knees in front of God's temple, praying with tears in his eyes and confessing the sins of the people of Israel, a large number of men, women, and children gathered around him and cried bitterly. Ezra, we have disobeyed God by marrying these foreign women. But there is still hope for the people of Israel, You have broken God's Law by marrying foreign women, and you have made the whole nation guilty! You're right! We will do what you say. Maaseiah, Eliezer, Jarib, and Gedaliah from the family of Joshua son of Jozadak and his brothers; These temple guards had foreign wives: Shallum, Telem, and Uri.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Shecaniah son of Jehiel from the family of Elam said:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">if we follow your advice and the advice of others who truly respect the laws of God. We must promise God that we will divorce our foreign wives and send them away, together with their children.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Ezra, it's up to you to do something! We will support whatever you do. So be brave!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Ezra stood up and made the chief priests, the Levites, and everyone else in Israel swear that they would follow the advice of Shecaniah.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Then Ezra left God's temple and went to spend the night in the living quarters of Jehohanan son of Eliashib. He felt sorry because of what the people had done, and he did not eat or drink a thing.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Three days later, on the twentieth day of the ninth month, everyone from Judah and Benjamin came to Jerusalem and sat in the temple courtyard. It was a serious meeting, and they sat there, trembling in the rain.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="11">Now you must confess your sins to the Lord God of your ancestors and obey him. Divorce your foreign wives and don't have anything to do with the rest of the foreigners who live around here.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Everyone in the crowd shouted:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">But there are so many of us, and we can't just stay out here in this downpour. A lot of us have sinned by marrying foreign women, and the matter can't be settled in only a day or two.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Why can't our officials stay on in Jerusalem and take care of this for us? Let everyone who has sinned in this way meet here at a certain time with leaders and judges from their own towns. If we take care of this problem, God will surely stop being so terribly angry with us.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Jonathan son of Asahel and Jahzeiah son of Tikvah were the only ones who objected, except for the two Levites, Meshullam and Shabbethai.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Everyone else who had returned from exile agreed with the plan. So Ezra the priest chose men who were heads of the families, and he listed their names. They started looking into the matter on the first day of the tenth month,</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="1">
			<VERS vnumber="1">I am Nehemiah son of Hacaliah, and in this book I tell what I have done. During the month of Chislev in the twentieth year that Artaxerxes ruled Persia, I was in his fortress city of Susa,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">when my brother Hanani came with some men from Judah. So I asked them about the Jews who had escaped from being captives in Babylonia. I also asked them about the city of Jerusalem.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">They told me, &amp;apos;Those captives who have come back are having all kinds of troubles. They are terribly disgraced, Jerusalem's walls are broken down, and its gates have been burned.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">When I heard this, I sat down on the ground and cried. Then for several days, I mourned; I went without eating to show my sorrow, and I prayed:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Lord God of heaven, you are great and fearsome. And you faithfully keep your promises to everyone who loves you and obeys your commands.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">I am your servant, so please have mercy on me and answer the prayer that I make day and night for these people of Israel who serve you. I, my family, and the rest of your people have sinned</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">by choosing to disobey you and the laws and teachings you gave to your servant Moses.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Please remember the promise you made to Moses. You told him that if we were unfaithful, you would scatter us among foreign nations.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">But you also said that no matter how far away we were, we could turn to you and start obeying your laws. Then you would bring us back to the place where you have chosen to be worshiped.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Our Lord , I am praying for your servants&amp;ndash;those you rescued by your great strength and mighty power.</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="2">
			<VERS vnumber="1">During the month of Nisan in the twentieth year that Artaxerxes was king, I served him his wine, as I had done before. But this was the first time I had ever looked depressed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">So the king said, &amp;apos;Why do you look so sad? You're not sick. Something must be bothering you.&amp;apos; Even though I was frightened, I prayed to the God who rules from heaven. Immediately, they replied, &amp;apos;Let's start building now!&amp;apos; So they got everything ready.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">I answered, &amp;apos;Your Majesty, I hope you live forever! I feel sad because the city where my ancestors are buried is in ruins, and its gates have been burned down.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">The king asked, &amp;apos;What do you want me to do?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Then I told the king, &amp;apos;Sir, if it's all right with you, please send me back to Judah, so that I can rebuild the city where my ancestors are buried.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">The queen was sitting beside the king when he asked me, &amp;apos;How long will it take, and when will you be back?&amp;apos; The king agreed to let me go, and I told him when I would return.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Then I asked, &amp;apos;Your Majesty, would you be willing to give me letters to the governors of the provinces west of the Euphrates River, so that I can travel safely to Judah?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">I will need timber to rebuild the gates of the fortress near the temple and more timber to construct the city wall and to build a place for me to live. And so, I would appreciate a letter to Asaph, who is in charge of the royal forest.&amp;apos; God was good to me, and the king did everything I asked.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">The king sent some army officers and cavalry troops along with me, and as I traveled through the Western Provinces, I gave the letters to the governors.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">But when Sanballat from Horon and Tobiah the Ammonite official heard about what had happened, they became very angry, because they didn't want anyone to help the people of Israel.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Three days after arriving in Jerusalem,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">I got up during the night and left my house. I took some men with me, without telling anyone what I thought God wanted me to do for the city. The only animal I took was the donkey I rode on.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">I went through Valley Gate on the west, then south past Dragon Spring, before coming to Garbage Gate. As I rode along, I took a good look at the crumbled walls of the city and the gates that had been torn down and burned.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">On the east side of the city, I headed north to Fountain Gate and King's Pool, but then the trail became too narrow for my donkey.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">So I went down to Kidron Valley and looked at the wall from there. Then before daylight I returned to the city through Valley Gate.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">None of the city officials knew what I had in mind. And I had not even told any of the Jews&amp;ndash;not the priests, the leaders, the officials, or any other Jews who would be helping in the work.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">But when I got back, I said to them, &amp;apos;Jerusalem is truly in a mess! The gates have been torn down and burned, and everything is in ruins. We must rebuild the city wall so that we can again take pride in our city.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Then I told them how kind God had been and what the king had said.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">When Sanballat, Tobiah, and Geshem the Arab heard about our plans, they started insulting us and saying, &amp;apos;Just look at you! Do you plan to rebuild the walls of the city and rebel against the king?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">I answered, &amp;apos;We are servants of the God who rules from heaven, and he will make our work succeed. So we will start rebuilding Jerusalem, but you have no right to any of its property, because you have had no part in its history.&amp;apos;</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="4">
			<VERS vnumber="1">When Sanballat, the governor of Samaria, heard that we were rebuilding the walls of Jerusalem, he became angry and started insulting our people.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">In front of his friends and the Samaritan army he said, &amp;apos;What is this feeble bunch of Jews trying to do? Are they going to rebuild the wall and offer sacrifices all in one day? Do they think they can make something out of this pile of scorched stones?&amp;apos; &amp;apos;So much rubble for us to haul! Worn out and weary, will we ever finish this wall?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Tobiah from Ammon was standing beside Sanballat and said, &amp;apos;Look at the wall they are building! Why, even a fox could knock over this pile of stones.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">But I prayed, &amp;apos;Our God, these people hate us and have wished horrible things for us. Please answer our prayers and make their insults fall on them! Let them be the ones to be dragged away as prisoners of war.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Don't forgive the mean and evil way they have insulted the builders.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">The people worked hard, and we built the walls of Jerusalem halfway up again.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">But Sanballat, Tobiah, the Arabs, the Ammonites, and the people from the city of Ashdod saw the walls going up and the holes being repaired. So they became angry</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">and decided to stir up trouble, and to fight against the people of Jerusalem.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">But we kept on praying to our God, and we also stationed guards day and night.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Meanwhile, the people of Judah were singing a sorrowful song:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Our enemies were saying, &amp;apos;Before those Jews know what has happened, we will sneak up and kill them and put an end to their work.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">On at least ten different occasions, the Jews living near our enemies warned us against attacks from every side,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">and so I sent people to guard the wall at its lowest places and where there were still holes in it. I placed them according to families, and they stood guard with swords and spears and with bows and arrows.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Then I looked things over and told the leaders, the officials, and the rest of the people, &amp;apos;Don't be afraid of your enemies! The Lord is great and fearsome. So think of him and fight for your relatives and children, your wives and homes!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Our enemies found out that we knew about their plot against us, but God kept them from doing what they had planned. So we went back to work on the wall.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">From then on, I let half of the young men work while the other half stood guard. They wore armor and had spears and shields, as well as bows and arrows. The leaders helped the workers</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">who were rebuilding the wall. Everyone who hauled building materials kept one hand free to carry a weapon.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Even the workers who were rebuilding the wall strapped on a sword. The worker who was to blow the signal trumpet stayed with me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">I told the people and their officials and leaders, &amp;apos;Our work is so spread out, that we are a long way from one another.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">If you hear the sound of the trumpet, come quickly and gather around me. Our God will help us fight.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Every day from dawn to dark, half of the workers rebuilt the walls, while the rest stood guard with their spears.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">I asked the men in charge and their workers to stay inside Jerusalem and stand guard at night. So they guarded the city at night and worked during the day.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">I even slept in my work clothes at night; my relatives, the workers, and the guards slept in theirs as well. And we always kept our weapons close by.</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="5">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Some of the men and their wives complained about the Jews in power</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">and said, &amp;apos;We have large families, and it takes a lot of grain merely to keep us alive.&amp;apos; Then I called a public meeting and accused the leaders So I made the leaders promise in front of the priests to give back the property. The people answered, &amp;apos;We will keep our promise.&amp;apos; Then they praised the Lord and did as they had promised.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Others said, &amp;apos;During the famine we even had to mortgage our fields, vineyards, and homes to them in order to buy grain.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Then others said, &amp;apos;We had to borrow money from those in power to pay the government tax on our fields and vineyards.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">We are Jews just as they are, and our children are as good as theirs. But we still have to sell our children as slaves, and some of our daughters have already been raped. We are completely helpless; our fields and vineyards have even been taken from us.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">When I heard their complaints and their charges, I became very angry.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">So I thought it over and said to the leaders and officials, &amp;apos;How can you charge your own people interest?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">by saying, &amp;apos;We have tried to buy back all of our people who were sold into exile. But here you are, selling more of them for us to buy back!&amp;apos; The officials and leaders did not say a word, because they knew this was true.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">I continued, &amp;apos;What you have done is wrong! We must honor our God by the way we live, so the Gentiles can't find fault with us.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">My relatives, my friends, and I are also lending money and grain, but we must no longer demand payment in return.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Now give back the fields, vineyards, olive orchards, and houses you have taken and also the interest you have been paid.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">The leaders answered, &amp;apos;We will do whatever you say and return their property, without asking to be repaid.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Then I emptied my pockets and said, &amp;apos;If you don't keep your promise, that's what God will do to you. He will empty out everything you own, even taking away your houses.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">I was governor of Judah from the twentieth year that Artaxerxes was king until the thirty-second year. And during these entire twelve years, my relatives and I refused to accept the food that I was allowed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Each governor before me had been a burden to the people by making them pay for his food and wine and by demanding forty silver coins a day. Even their officials had been a burden to the people. But I respected God, and I didn't think it was right to be so hard on them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">I spent all my time getting the wall rebuilt and did not buy any property. Everyone working for me did the same thing.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">I usually fed 150 of our own Jewish people and their leaders, as well as foreign visitors from surrounding lands.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Each day one ox, six of the best sheep, and lots of chickens were prepared. Then every ten days, a large supply of wine was brought in. I knew what a heavy burden this would have been for the people, and so I did not ask for my food allowance as governor.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">I pray that God will bless me for everything I have done for my people.</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="6">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Sanballat, Tobiah, Geshem, and our other enemies learned that I had completely rebuilt the wall. All I lacked was hanging the doors in the gates.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Then Sanballat and Geshem sent a message, asking me to meet with them in one of the villages in Ono Valley. I knew they were planning to harm me in some way.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">So I sent messengers to tell them, &amp;apos;My work is too important to stop now and go there. I can't afford to slow down the work just to visit with you.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">They invited me four times, but each time I refused to go.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Finally, Sanballat sent an official to me with an unsealed letter,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">which said: A rumor is going around among the nations that you and the other Jews are rebuilding the wall and planning to rebel, because you want to be their king. And Geshem says it's true!</VERS>

From heaven you listened to their prayers and because of your great mercy, you sent leaders to rescue them. they would turn against you, and you would hand them over to their enemies.

			<VERS vnumber="8">It upset me so much that I threw out every bit of Tobiah's furniture.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Then I ordered the room to be cleaned and the temple utensils, the grain offerings, and the incense to be brought back into the room.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">I also found out that the temple singers and several other Levites had returned to work on their farms, because they had not been given their share of the harvest.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">I called the leaders together and angrily asked them, &amp;apos;Why is the temple neglected?&amp;apos; Then I told them to start doing their jobs.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">After this, everyone in Judah brought a tenth of their grain, wine, and olive oil to the temple storeroom.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Finally, I appointed three men with good reputations to be in charge of what was brought there and to distribute it to the others. They were Shelemiah the priest, Zadok the teacher of the Law, and Pedaiah the Levite. Their assistant was Hanan, the son of Zaccur and the grandson of Mattaniah.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">I pray that my God will remember these good things that I have done for his temple and for those who worship there.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">I also noticed what the people of Judah were doing on the Sabbath. Not only were they trampling grapes to make wine, but they were harvesting their grain, grapes, figs, and other crops, and then loading these on donkeys to sell in Jerusalem. So I warned them not to sell food on the Sabbath.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">People who had moved to Jerusalem from the city of Tyre were bringing in fish and other things to sell there on the Sabbath.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">I got angry and said to the leaders of Judah, &amp;apos;This evil you are doing is an insult to the Sabbath!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Didn't God punish us and this city because our ancestors did these very same things? And here you are, about to make God furious again by disgracing the Sabbath!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">I ordered the gates of Jerusalem to be closed on the eve of the Sabbath and not to be opened until after the Sabbath had ended. Then I put some of my own men in charge of the gates to make certain that nothing was brought in on the Sabbath.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Once or twice some merchants spent the night outside Jerusalem with their goods.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">But I warned them, &amp;apos;If you do this again, I'll have you arrested.&amp;apos; From then on, they did not come on the Sabbath.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">I ordered the Levites to make themselves holy and to guard the gates on the Sabbath, so that it would be kept holy.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">I discovered that some Jewish men had married women from Ashdod, Ammon, and Moab.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">About half of their children could not speak Hebrew&amp;ndash;they spoke only the language of Ashdod or some other foreign language.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">So in my anger, I called down curses on those men. I had them beaten and even pulled out the hair of some of them. Then I made them promise:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">God dearly loved King Solomon of Israel and made him the greatest king on earth, but Solomon's foreign wives led him into sin.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">So we will obey you and not rebel against our God by marrying foreign women.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">Jehoiada, the son of the high priest Eliashib, had a son who had married a daughter of Sanballat from Horon, and I forced his son to leave.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">I pray that God will punish them for breaking their priestly vows and disgracing the Levi tribe.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">Then I made sure that the people were free from every foreign influence, and I assigned duties for the priests and Levites.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">I also arranged for the people to bring firewood to the altar each day and for them to bring the first part of their harvest to the temple.</VERS>

	<BIBLEBOOK bnumber="17" bname="Esther">
		<CHAPTER cnumber="1">
			<VERS vnumber="3">During the third year of his rule, Xerxes gave a big dinner for all his officials and officers. The governors and leaders of the provinces were also invited, and even the commanders of the Persian and Median armies came.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">For 180 days he showed off his wealth and spent a lot of money to impress his guests with the greatness of his kingdom. Your Majesty, Queen Vashti has not only embarrassed you, but she has insulted your officials and everyone else in all the provinces.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">At the end of this time, King Xerxes gave another dinner and invited everyone in the city of Susa, no matter who they were. The eating and drinking lasted seven days in the beautiful palace gardens.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">The area was decorated with blue and white cotton curtains tied back with purple linen cords that ran through silver rings fastened to marble columns. Couches of gold and silver rested on pavement that had all kinds of designs made from costly bright-colored stones and marble and mother-of-pearl.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">The guests drank from gold cups, and each cup had a different design. The king was generous</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">and said to them, &amp;apos;Drink all you want!&amp;apos; Then he told his servants, &amp;apos;Keep their cups full.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">While the men were enjoying themselves, Queen Vashti gave the women a big dinner inside the royal palace.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">By the seventh day, King Xerxes was feeling happy because of so much wine. And he asked his seven personal servants, Mehuman, Biztha, Harbona, Bigtha, Abagtha, Zethar, and Carkas,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">to bring Queen Vashti to him. The king wanted her to wear her crown and let his people and his officials see how beautiful she was.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">The king's servants told Queen Vashti what he had said, but she refused to go to him, and this made him terribly angry.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">The king said to them, &amp;apos;Queen Vashti refused to come to me when I sent my servants for her. What does the law say I should do about that?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Then Memucan told the king and the officials:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">The women in the kingdom will hear about this, and they will refuse to respect their husbands. They will say, &amp;apos;If Queen Vashti doesn't obey her husband, why should we?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Before this day is over, the wives of the officials of Persia and Media will find out what Queen Vashti has done, and they will refuse to obey their husbands. They won't respect their husbands, and their husbands will be angry with them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Your Majesty, if you agree, you should write for the Medes and Persians a law that can never be changed. This law would keep Queen Vashti from ever seeing you again. Then you could let someone who respects you be queen in her place.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">When the women in your great kingdom hear about this new law, they will respect their husbands, no matter if they are rich or poor.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">King Xerxes and his officials liked what Memucan had said,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">and he sent letters to all of his provinces. Each letter was written in the language of the province to which it was sent, and it said that husbands should be in charge of their wives and children.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="2">
			<VERS vnumber="1">After a while, King Xerxes got over being angry. But he kept thinking about what Vashti had done and the law that he had written because of her.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Then the king's personal servants said: Your Majesty, a search must be made to find you some beautiful young women. King Xerxes liked these suggestions, and he followed them. Hegai was put in charge of all the women,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">You can select officers in every province to bring them to the place where you keep your wives in the capital city of Susa. Put your servant Hegai in charge of them since that is his job. He can see to it that they are given the proper beauty treatments.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Then let the young woman who pleases you most take Vashti's place as queen.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">At this time a Jew named Mordecai was living in Susa. His father was Jair, and his grandfather Shimei was the son of Kish from the tribe of Benjamin.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Kish was one of the people that Nebuchadnezzar had taken from Jerusalem, when he took King Jeconiah of Judah to Babylonia.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Mordecai had a very beautiful cousin named Esther, whose Hebrew name was Hadassah. He had raised her as his own daughter, after her father and mother died.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">When the king ordered the search for beautiful women, many were taken to the king's palace in Susa, and Esther was one of them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">and from the first day, Esther was his favorite. He began her beauty treatments at once. He also gave her plenty of food and seven special maids from the king's palace, and they had the best rooms.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Mordecai had warned Esther not to tell anyone that she was a Jew, and she obeyed him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">He was anxious to see how Esther was getting along and to learn what had happened to her. So each day he would walk back and forth in front of the court where the women lived.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">The young women were given beauty treatments for one whole year. The first six months their skin was rubbed with olive oil and myrrh, and the last six months it was treated with perfumes and cosmetics. Then each of them spent the night alone with King Xerxes.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">When a young woman went to the king, she could wear whatever clothes or jewelry she chose from the women's living quarters.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">In the evening she would go to the king, and the following morning she would go to the place where his wives stayed after being with him. There a man named Shaashgaz was in charge of the king's wives. Only the ones the king wanted and asked for by name could go back to the king.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Xerxes liked Esther more than he did any of the other young women. None of them pleased him as much as she did, and he immediately fell in love with her and crowned her queen in place of Vashti.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">In honor of Esther he gave a big dinner for his leaders and officials. Then he declared a holiday everywhere in his kingdom and gave expensive gifts.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">When the young women were brought together again, Esther's cousin Mordecai had become a palace official.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">He had told Esther never to tell anyone that she was a Jew, and she obeyed him, just as she had always done.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Bigthana and Teresh were the two men who guarded King Xerxes' rooms, but they got angry with the king and decided to kill him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Mordecai found out about their plans and asked Queen Esther to tell the king what he had found out.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">King Xerxes learned that Mordecai's report was true, and he had the two men hanged. Then the king had all of this written down in his record book as he watched.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="3">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Later, King Xerxes promoted Haman the son of Hammedatha to the highest position in his kingdom. Haman was a descendant of Agag,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">and the king had given orders for his officials at the royal gate to honor Haman by kneeling down to him. All of them obeyed except Mordecai.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">When the other officials asked Mordecai why he disobeyed the king's command,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">he said, &amp;apos;Because I am a Jew.&amp;apos; They spoke to him for several days about kneeling down, but he still refused to obey. Finally, they reported this to Haman, to find out if he would let Mordecai get away with it. Your Majesty, there are some people who live all over your kingdom and won't have a thing to do with anyone else. They have customs that are different from everyone else's, and they refuse to obey your laws. We would be better off to get rid of them! On the thirteenth day of Adar, the twelfth month, all Jewish men, women, and children are to be killed. And their property is to be taken.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Haman was furious to learn that Mordecai refused to kneel down and honor him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">And when he found out that Mordecai was a Jew, he knew that killing only Mordecai was not enough. Every Jew in the whole kingdom had to be killed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">It was now the twelfth year of the rule of King Xerxes. During Nisan, the first month of the year, Haman said, &amp;apos;Find out the best time for me to do this.&amp;apos; The time chosen was Adar, the twelfth month.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Then Haman went to the king and said:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Why not give orders for all of them to be killed? I can promise that you will get tons of silver for your treasury.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">The king handed his official ring to Haman, who hated the Jews, and the king told him,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">&amp;apos;Do what you want with those people! You can keep their money.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">On the thirteenth day of Nisan, Haman called in the king's secretaries and ordered them to write letters in every language used in the kingdom. The letters were written in the name of the king and sealed by using the king's own ring. At once they were sent to the king's highest officials, the governors of each province, and the leaders of the different nations in the kingdom of Xerxes.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">The letters were taken by messengers to every part of the kingdom, and this is what was said in the letters:</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="4">
			<VERS vnumber="1">When Mordecai heard about the letter, he tore his clothes in sorrow and put on sackcloth. Then he covered his head with ashes and went through the city, crying and weeping.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">But he could go only as far as the palace gate, because no one wearing sackcloth was allowed inside the palace.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">In every province where the king's orders were read, the Jews cried and mourned, and they went without eating. Many of them even put on sackcloth and sat in ashes.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">When Esther's servant girls and her other servants told her what Mordecai was doing, she became very upset and sent Mordecai some clothes to wear in place of the sackcloth. But he refused to take them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Esther had a servant named Hathach, who had been given to her by the king. So she called him in and said, &amp;apos;Find out what's wrong with Mordecai and why he's acting this way.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Hathach went to Mordecai in the city square in front of the palace gate,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">and Mordecai told him everything that had happened. He also told him how much money Haman had promised to add to the king's treasury, if all the Jews were killed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Mordecai gave Hathach a copy of the orders for the murder of the Jews and told him that these had been read in Susa. He said, &amp;apos;Show this to Esther and explain what it means. Ask her to go to the king and beg him to have pity on her people, the Jews!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Hathach went back to Esther and told her what Mordecai had said.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">She answered, &amp;apos;Tell Mordecai</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">there is a law about going in to see the king, and all his officials and his people know about this law. Anyone who goes in to see the king without being invited by him will be put to death. The only way that anyone can be saved is for the king to hold out the gold scepter to that person. And it's been thirty days since he has asked for me.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">When Mordecai was told what Esther had said,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">he sent back this reply, &amp;apos;Don't think that you will escape being killed with the rest of the Jews, just because you live in the king's palace.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">If you don't speak up now, we will somehow get help, but you and your family will be killed. It could be that you were made queen for a time like this!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Esther sent a message to Mordecai, saying,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">&amp;apos;Bring together all the Jews in Susa and tell them to go without eating for my sake! Don't eat or drink for three days and nights. My servant girls and I will do the same. Then I will go in to see the king, even if it means I must die.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Mordecai did everything Esther told him to do.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="5">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Three days later, Esther dressed in her royal robes and went to the inner court of the palace in front of the throne. The king was sitting there, facing the open doorway.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">He was happy to see Esther, and he held out the gold scepter to her. When Esther came up and touched the tip of the scepter, The king and Haman went to Esther's dinner, When Haman got home, he called together his friends and his wife Zeresh This seemed like a good idea to Haman, and he had the gallows built.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">the king said, &amp;apos;Esther, what brings you here? Just ask, and I will give you as much as half of my kingdom.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Esther answered, &amp;apos;Your Majesty, please come with Haman to a dinner I will prepare for you later today.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">The king said to his servants, &amp;apos;Hurry and get Haman, so we can accept Esther's invitation.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">and while they were drinking wine, the king asked her, &amp;apos;What can I do for you? Just ask, and I will give you as much as half of my kingdom.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Haman was feeling great as he left. But when he saw Mordecai at the palace gate, he noticed that Mordecai did not stand up or show him any respect. This made Haman really angry,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">but he did not say a thing.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">and started bragging about his great wealth and all his sons. He told them the many ways that the king had honored him and how all the other officials and leaders had to respect him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Haman added, &amp;apos;That's not all! Besides the king himself, I'm the only person Queen Esther invited for dinner. She has also invited the king and me to dinner tomorrow.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">But none of this makes me happy, as long as I see that Jew Mordecai serving the king.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Haman's wife and friends said to him, &amp;apos;Have a gallows built about 22 meters high, and tomorrow morning ask the king to hang Mordecai there. Then later, you can have dinner with the king and enjoy yourself.&amp;apos;</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="6">
			<VERS vnumber="1">That night the king could not sleep, and he had a servant read him the records of what had happened since he had been king.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">When the servant read how Mordecai had kept Bigthana and Teresh from killing the king,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">the king asked, &amp;apos;What has been done to reward Mordecai for this?&amp;apos; &amp;apos;Nothing, Your Majesty!&amp;apos; the king's servants replied. &amp;apos;Tell him to come in,&amp;apos; the king commanded. Haman was sure that he was the one the king wanted to honor.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">About this time, Haman came in to ask the king to have Mordecai hanged on the gallows he had built. The king saw him and asked, &amp;apos;Who is that man waiting in front of the throne room?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">The king's servants answered, &amp;apos;Your Majesty, it is Haman.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">When Haman entered the room, the king asked him, &amp;apos;What should I do for a man I want to honor?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">So he replied, &amp;apos;Your Majesty, if you wish to honor a man,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">get someone to bring him one of your own robes and one of your own horses with a fancy headdress.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Tell one of your highest officials to place your robe on this man and lead him through the streets on your horse, while someone shouts, &amp;quot;This is how the king honors a man!&amp;quot; &amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">The king replied, &amp;apos;Hurry and do just what you have said! Don't forget a thing. Get the robe and the horse for Mordecai the Jew, who serves as one of the king's officials!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Haman got the king's robe and put it on Mordecai. He led him through the city on the horse and shouted as he went, &amp;apos;This is how the king honors a man!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Afterwards, Mordecai returned to his duties in the king's palace, and Haman hurried home, hiding his face in shame.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Haman told his wife and friends what had happened. Then his wife and his advisors said, &amp;apos;If Mordecai is a Jew, this is just the beginning of your troubles! You will end up a ruined man.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">They were still talking, when the king's servants came and quickly took Haman to the dinner that Esther had prepared.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="7">
			<VERS vnumber="1">The king and Haman were dining with Esther</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">and drinking wine during the second dinner, when the king again said, &amp;apos;Esther, what can I do for you? Just ask, and I will give you as much as half of my kingdom!&amp;apos; Haman was terrified, as he looked at the king and the queen. Haman realized that the king had already decided what to do with him, and he stayed and begged Esther to save his life. As soon as the king said this, his servants covered Haman's head. &amp;apos;Hang Haman from his own gallows!&amp;apos; the king commanded.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Esther answered, &amp;apos;Your Majesty, if you really care for me and are willing to help, you can save me and my people. That's what I really want,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">because a reward has been promised to anyone who kills my people. Your Majesty, if we were merely going to be sold as slaves, I would not have bothered you.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">&amp;apos;Who would dare to do such a thing?&amp;apos; the king asked.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Esther replied, &amp;apos;That evil Haman is the one out to get us!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">The king was so angry that he got up, left his wine, and went out into the palace garden.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Just as the king came back into the room, Haman got down on his knees beside Esther, who was lying on the couch. The king shouted, &amp;apos;Now you're even trying to rape my queen here in my own palace!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Then Harbona, one of the king's personal servants, said, &amp;apos;Your Majesty, Haman built a gallows 22 meters high beside his house, so he could hang Mordecai on it. And Mordecai is the very one who spoke up and saved your life.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">At once, Haman was hanged on the gallows he had built to hang Mordecai, and the king calmed down.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="8">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Before the end of the day, King Xerxes gave Esther everything that had belonged to Haman, the enemy of the Jews. Esther told the king that Mordecai was her cousin. So the king made Mordecai one of his highest officials</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">and gave him the royal ring that Haman had worn. Then Esther put Mordecai in charge of Haman's property. A copy of this law is to be posted in every province and read by everyone. After the law was announced in Susa, everyone shouted and cheered,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Once again Esther went to speak to the king. This time she fell down at his feet, crying and begging, &amp;apos;Please stop Haman's evil plan to have the Jews killed!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">King Xerxes held out the golden scepter to Esther,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">and she got up and said, &amp;apos;Your Majesty, I know that you will do the right thing and that you really love me. Please stop what Haman has planned. He has already sent letters demanding that the Jews in all your provinces be killed,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">and I can't bear to see my people and my own relatives destroyed.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">King Xerxes then said to Esther and Mordecai, &amp;apos;I have already ordered Haman to be hanged and his house given to Esther, because of his evil plans to kill the Jews.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">I now give you permission to make a law that will save the lives of your people. You may use my ring to seal the law, so that it can never be changed.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">On the twenty-third day of Sivan, the third month, the king's secretaries wrote the law. They obeyed Mordecai and wrote to the Jews, the rulers, the governors, and the officials of all 127 provinces from India to Ethiopia. The letters were written in every language used in the kingdom, including the Jewish language.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">They were written in the name of King Xerxes and sealed with his ring. Then they were taken by messengers who rode the king's finest and fastest horses.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">and the Jews were no longer afraid. In fact, they were very happy and felt that they had won a victory.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">In every province and city where the law was sent, the Jews had parties and celebrated. Many of the people in the provinces accepted the Jewish religion, because they were now afraid of the Jews.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="9">
			<VERS vnumber="1">The first law that the king had made was to be followed on the thirteenth day of Adar, the twelfth month. This was the very day that the enemies of the Jews had hoped to do away with them. But the Jews turned things around,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">and in the cities of every province they came together to attack their enemies. Everyone was afraid of the Jews, and no one could do anything to oppose them. Each year you must celebrate on both the fourteenth and the fifteenth of Adar, We pray that all of you will live in peace and safety.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">The leaders of the provinces, the rulers, the governors, and the court officials were afraid of Mordecai and took sides with the Jews.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Everyone in the provinces knew that the king had promoted him and had given him a lot of power.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">The Jews took their swords and did away with their enemies, without showing any mercy.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Later that day, someone told the king how many people had been killed in Susa.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Then he told Esther, &amp;apos;Five hundred people, including Haman's ten sons, have been killed in Susa alone. If that many were killed here, what must have happened in the provinces? Is there anything else you want done? Just tell me, and it will be done.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Esther answered, &amp;apos;Your Majesty, please let the Jews in Susa fight to defend themselves tomorrow, just as they did today. And order the bodies of Haman's ten sons to be hanged in public.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">King Xerxes did what Esther had requested, and the bodies of Haman's sons were hung in Susa.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Then on the fourteenth day of Adar the Jews of the city got together and killed 300 more people. But they still did not take anything that belonged to their enemies.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">On the fifteenth day of the month the Jews in Susa held a holiday and celebrated, after killing their enemies on the thirteenth and the fourteenth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">This is why the Jews in the villages now celebrate on the fourteenth day of the month. It is a joyful holiday that they celebrate by feasting and sending gifts of food to each other.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Mordecai wrote down everything that had happened. Then he sent letters to the Jews everywhere in the provinces</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">and told them:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">the days when we Jews defeated our enemies. Remember this month as a time when our sorrow was turned to joy, and celebration took the place of crying. Celebrate by having parties and by giving to the poor and by sharing gifts of food with each other.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">They followed Mordecai's instructions and set aside these two days every year as a time of celebration.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1">Many years ago, a man named Job lived in the land of Uz. He was a truly good person, who respected God and refused to do evil. Satan replied, &amp;apos;I have been going all over the earth.&amp;apos; Then Satan left. &amp;apos;We bring nothing at birth; we take nothing with us at death. The Lord alone gives and takes. Praise the name of the Lord !&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Job had 7 sons and 3 daughters.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">He owned 7,000 sheep, 3,000 camels, 500 pair of oxen, 500 donkeys, and a large number of servants. He was the richest person in the East.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Job's sons took turns having feasts in their homes, and they always invited their three sisters to join in the eating and drinking.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">After each feast, Job would send for his children and perform a ceremony, as a way of asking God to forgive them of any wrongs they may have done. He would get up early the next morning and offer a sacrifice for each of them, just in case they had sinned or silently cursed God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">One day, when the angels had gathered around the Lord , and Satan was there with them,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">the Lord asked, &amp;apos;Satan, where have you been?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Then the Lord asked, &amp;apos;What do you think of my servant Job? No one on earth is like him&amp;ndash;he is a truly good person, who respects me and refuses to do evil.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">&amp;apos;Why shouldn't he respect you?&amp;apos; Satan remarked.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">&amp;apos;You are like a wall protecting not only him, but his entire family and all his property. You make him successful in whatever he does, and his flocks and herds are everywhere.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Try taking away everything he owns, and he will curse you to your face.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">The Lord replied, &amp;apos;All right, Satan, do what you want with anything that belongs to him, but don't harm Job.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Job's sons and daughters were having a feast in the home of his oldest son,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">when someone rushed up to Job and said, &amp;apos;While your servants were plowing with your oxen, and your donkeys were nearby eating grass,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">a gang of Sabeans attacked and stole the oxen and donkeys! Your other servants were killed, and I am the only one who escaped to tell you.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">That servant was still speaking, when a second one came running and said, &amp;apos;God sent down a fire that killed your sheep and your servants. I am the only one who escaped to tell you.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Before that servant finished speaking, a third one raced up and said, &amp;apos;Three gangs of Chaldeans attacked and stole your camels! All of your other servants were killed, and I am the only one who escaped to tell you.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">That servant was still speaking, when a fourth one dashed up and said, &amp;apos;Your children were having a feast and drinking wine at the home of your oldest son,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">when suddenly a windstorm from the desert blew the house down, crushing all of your children. I am the only one who escaped to tell you.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">When Job heard this, he tore his clothes and shaved his head because of his great sorrow. He knelt on the ground, then worshiped God</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">and said:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">In spite of everything, Job did not sin or accuse God of doing wrong.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="3">Then the Lord asked, &amp;apos;What do you think of my servant Job? No one on earth is like him&amp;ndash;he is a truly good person, who respects me and refuses to do evil. And he hasn't changed, even though you persuaded me to destroy him for no reason.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Satan answered, &amp;apos;There's no pain like your own. People will do anything to stay alive.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Try striking Job's own body with pain, and he will curse you to your face.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">&amp;apos;All right!&amp;apos; the Lord replied. &amp;apos;Make Job suffer as much as you want, but just don't kill him.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Satan left and caused painful sores to break out all over Job's body&amp;ndash;from head to toe.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Then Job sat on the ash-heap to show his sorrow. And while he was scraping his sores with a broken piece of pottery,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">his wife asked, &amp;apos;Why do you still trust God? Why don't you curse him and die?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Job replied, &amp;apos;Don't talk like a fool! If we accept blessings from God, we must accept trouble as well.&amp;apos; In all that happened, Job never once said anything against God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Eliphaz from Teman, Bildad from Shuah, and Zophar from Naamah were three of Job's friends, and they heard about his troubles. So they agreed to visit Job and comfort him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">When they came near enough to see Job, they could hardly recognize him. And in their great sorrow, they tore their clothes, then sprinkled dust on their heads and cried bitterly.</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="1">
			<VERS vnumber="1">When the son of David was king in Jerusalem, he was known to be very wise, and he said: Everything is nonsense. I have seen it all&amp;ndash; nothing makes sense! for all of our hard work here on this earth? but still the world never changes. the sun goes down; it hurries right back to where it started from. the wind blows north; round and round it blows over and over again. but it never spills over; one by one the rivers return than words could ever say. Our eyes and our ears are never satisfied with what we see and hear. has happened before; nothing is new, nothing under the sun. &amp;apos;Here is something new!&amp;apos; But it happened before, long before we were born. is remembered anymore, and everyone yet to be born will be forgotten too. it can't be made straight; if something isn't there, it can't be counted. the more you hurt; the more you understand, the more you suffer.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Nothing makes sense!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">What is there to show</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">People come, and people go,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">The sun comes up,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">The wind blows south,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">All rivers empty into the sea, to their source.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">All of life is far more boring</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Everything that happens</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Someone might say,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">No one who lived in the past</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">I said these things when I lived in Jerusalem as king of Israel.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">With all my wisdom I tried to understand everything that happens here on earth. And God has made this so hard for us humans to do.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">I have seen it all, and everything is just as senseless as chasing the wind.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">If something is crooked,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">I said to myself, &amp;apos;You are by far the wisest person who has ever lived in Jerusalem. You are eager to learn, and you have learned a lot.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Then I decided to find out all I could about wisdom and foolishness. Soon I realized that this too was as senseless as chasing the wind.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">The more you know,</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="2">
			<VERS vnumber="1">I said to myself, &amp;apos;Have fun and enjoy yourself!&amp;apos; But this didn't make sense.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Laughing and having fun is crazy. What good does it do?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">I wanted to find out what was best for us during the short time we have on this earth. So I decided to make myself happy with wine and find out what it means to be foolish, without really being foolish myself.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">I did some great things. I built houses and planted vineyards.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">I had flower gardens and orchards full of fruit trees.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">And I had pools where I could get water for the trees.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">I owned slaves, and their sons and daughters became my slaves. I had more sheep and goats than anyone who had ever lived in Jerusalem.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Foreign rulers brought me silver, gold, and precious treasures. Men and women sang for me, and I had many wives who gave me great pleasure.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">I was the most famous person who had ever lived in Jerusalem, and I was very wise.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">I got whatever I wanted and did whatever made me happy. But most of all, I enjoyed my work.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Then I thought about everything I had done, including the hard work, and it was simply chasing the wind. Nothing on earth is worth the trouble.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">I asked myself, &amp;apos;What can the next king do that I haven't done?&amp;apos; Then I decided to compare wisdom with foolishness and stupidity.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">And I discovered that wisdom is better than foolishness, just as light is better than darkness.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Wisdom is like having two good eyes; foolishness leaves you in the dark. But wise or foolish, we all end up the same.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Finally, I said to myself, &amp;apos;Being wise got me nowhere! The same thing will happen to me that happens to fools. Nothing makes sense.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Wise or foolish, we all die and are soon forgotten.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">This made me hate life. Everything we do is painful; it's just as senseless as chasing the wind.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Suddenly I realized that others would someday get everything I had worked for so hard, then I started hating it all.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Who knows if those people will be sensible or stupid? Either way, they will own everything I have earned by hard work and wisdom. It doesn't make sense.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">I thought about all my hard work, and I felt depressed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">When we use our wisdom, knowledge, and skill to get what we own, why do we have to leave it to someone who didn't work for it? This is senseless and wrong.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">What do we really gain from all of our hard work?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">Our bodies ache during the day, and work is torture. Then at night our thoughts are troubled. It just doesn't make sense.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">The best thing we can do is to enjoy eating, drinking, and working. I believe these are God's gifts to us,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">and no one enjoys eating and living more than I do.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">If we please God, he will make us wise, understanding, and happy. But if we sin, God will make us struggle for a living, then he will give all we own to someone who pleases him. This makes no more sense than chasing the wind.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1">Everything on earth has its own time and its own season. for birth and death, planting and reaping, destroying and building, weeping and dancing, and gathering stones, embracing and parting. for finding and losing, keeping and giving, listening and speaking. for love and hate, for war and peace. has happened before, and all that will be has already been&amp;ndash; God does everything</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">There is a time</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">for killing and healing,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">for crying and laughing,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">for throwing stones</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">There is a time</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">for tearing and sewing,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">There is also a time</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">What do we gain by all our hard work?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">I have seen what difficult things God demands of us.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">God makes everything happen at the right time. Yet none of us can ever fully understand all he has done, and he puts questions in our minds about the past and the future.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">I know the best thing we can do is to always enjoy life,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">because God's gift to us is the happiness we get from our food and drink and from the work we do.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Everything God has done will last forever; nothing he does can ever be changed. God has done all this, so that we will worship him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Everything that happens over and over again.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Everywhere on earth I saw violence and injustice instead of fairness and justice.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">So I told myself that God has set a time and a place for everything. He will judge everyone, both the wicked and the good.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">I know God is testing us to show us that we are merely animals.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Like animals we breathe and die, and we are no better off than they are. It just doesn't make sense.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">All living creatures go to the same place. We are made from earth, and we return to earth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Who really knows if our spirits go up and the spirits of animals go down into the earth?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">We were meant to enjoy our work, and that's the best thing we can do. We can never know the future.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="4">
			<VERS vnumber="1">I looked again and saw people being mistreated everywhere on earth. They were crying, but no one was there to offer comfort, and those who mistreated them were powerful.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">I said to myself, &amp;apos;The dead are better off than the living.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">But those who have never been born are better off than anyone else, because they have never seen the terrible things that happen on this earth.&amp;apos; and starve to death. eaten in peace is better than twice as much earned from overwork</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Then I realized that we work and do wonderful things just because we are jealous of others. This makes no more sense than chasing the wind.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Fools will fold their hands</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Yet a very little food and chasing the wind.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Once again I saw that nothing on earth makes sense.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">For example, some people don't have friends or family. But they are never satisfied with what they own, and they never stop working to get more. They should ask themselves, &amp;apos;Why am I always working to have more? Who will get what I leave behind?&amp;apos; What a senseless and miserable life!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">You are better having a friend than to be all alone, because then you will get more enjoyment out of what you earn.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">If you fall, your friend can help you up. But if you fall without having a friend nearby, you are really in trouble.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">If you sleep alone, you won't have anyone to keep you warm on a cold night.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Someone might be able to beat up one of you, but not both of you. As the saying goes, &amp;apos;A rope made from three strands of cord is hard to break.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">You may be poor and young, but if you are wise, you are better off than a foolish old king who won't listen to advice.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Even if you were not born into the royal family and have been a prisoner and poor, you can still be king.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">I once saw everyone in the world follow a young leader who came to power after the king was gone.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">His followers could not even be counted. But years from now, no one will praise him&amp;ndash;this makes no more sense than chasing the wind.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="5">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Be careful what you do when you enter the house of God. Fools go there to offer sacrifices, because all they do is sin. But it's best just to listen when you go to worship.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Don't talk before you think or make promises to God without thinking them through. God is in heaven, and you are on earth, so don't talk too much.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">If you keep thinking about something, you will dream about it. If you talk too much, you will say the wrong thing.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">God doesn't like fools. So don't be slow to keep your promises to God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">It's better not to make a promise at all than to make one and not keep it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Don't let your mouth get you in trouble! And don't say to the worship leader, &amp;apos;I didn't mean what I said.&amp;apos; God can destroy everything you have worked for, so don't say something that makes God angry.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Respect and obey God! Daydreaming leads to a lot of senseless talk.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Don't be surprised if the poor of your country are abused, and injustice takes the place of justice. After all, the lower officials must do what the higher ones order them to do.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">And since the king is the highest official, he benefits most from the taxes paid on the land.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">If you love money and wealth, you will never be satisfied with what you have. This doesn't make a bit of sense.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">The more you have, the more everyone expects from you. Your money won't do you any good&amp;ndash;others will just spend it for you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">If you have to work hard for a living, you can rest well at night, even if you don't have much to eat. But if you are rich, you can't even sleep.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">I have seen something terribly unfair. People get rich, but it does them no good.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Suddenly they lose everything in a bad business deal, then have nothing to leave for their children.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">They came into this world naked, and when they die, they will be just as naked. They can't take anything with them, and they won't have anything to show for all their work.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">That's terribly unfair. They leave the world just as they came. They gained nothing from running after the wind.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Besides all this, they are always gloomy at mealtime, and they are troubled, sick, and bitter.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">What is the best thing to do in the short life God has given us? I think we should enjoy eating, drinking, and working hard. This is what God intends for us to do.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Suppose you are very rich and able to enjoy everything you own. Then go ahead and enjoy working hard&amp;ndash;this is God's gift to you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">God will keep you so happy that you won't have time to worry about each day.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="6">
			<VERS vnumber="1">There is something else terribly unfair, and it troubles everyone on earth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">God may give you everything you want&amp;ndash;money, property, and wealth. Then God doesn't let you enjoy it, and someone you don't even know gets it all. That's senseless and terribly unfair!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">You may live a long time and have a hundred children. But a child born dead is better off than you, unless you enjoy life and have a decent burial.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">even if you live two thousand years and don't enjoy life. As you know, we all end up in the same place.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">We struggle just to have enough to eat, but we are never satisfied.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">We may be sensible, yet we are no better off than a fool. And if we are poor, it still doesn't do us any good to try to live right.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">It's better to enjoy what we have than to always want something else, because that makes no more sense than chasing the wind.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Everything that happens was decided long ago. We humans know what we are like, and we can't argue with God, because he is too strong for us.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">The more we talk, the less sense we make, so what good does it do to talk?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Life is short and meaningless, and it fades away like a shadow. Who knows what is best for us? Who knows what will happen after we are gone?</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="7">
			<VERS vnumber="1">A good reputation at the time of death is better than loving care than to attend a feast; funerals remind us that we all must die. because a sad face may hide a happy heart. but fools always laugh. is better by far than praise from fools. It sounds like thorns crackling in a fire. of sensible people, and bribes can ruin you. than something just begun; patience is better than too much pride. and hold a grudge. &amp;apos;Why is everything worse than it used to be?&amp;apos; than an inheritance. just like money; knowledge with good sense will lead you to life. If God makes something crooked, can you make it straight? you should be cheerful; when times are bad, think about what it means. God makes them both to keep us from knowing what will happen next. at the time of birth.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="12">Wisdom will protect you</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Think of what God has done!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">When times are good,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">I have seen everything during this senseless life of mine. I have seen good citizens die for doing the right thing, while criminals live and prosper.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">So don't destroy yourself by being too good or acting too smart!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Don't die before your time by being too evil or acting like a fool.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Keep to the middle of the road. You can do this if you truly respect God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Wisdom will make you stronger than the ten most powerful leaders in your city.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">No one in this world always does right.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Don't listen to everything that everyone says, or you might hear your servant cursing you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Haven't you cursed many others?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">I told myself that I would be smart and try to understand all this, but it was too much for me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">The truth is beyond us. It's far too deep.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">So I decided to learn everything I could and become wise enough to discover what life is all about. At the same time, I wanted to understand why it's stupid and senseless to be an evil fool.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">Here is what I discovered: A bad woman is worse than death. She is a trap, reaching out with body and soul to catch you. But if you obey God, you can escape. If you don't obey, you are done for.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">With all my wisdom I have tried to find out how everything fits together,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">but so far I have not been able to. I do know there is one good man in a thousand, but never have I found a good woman.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">I did learn one thing: We were completely honest when God created us, but now we have twisted minds.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="8">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Who is smart enough to explain everything? Wisdom makes you cheerful and gives you a smile. Everyone who lives right and respects God will prosper, and rejects God will prosper or live very long.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">If you promised God that you would be loyal to the king, I advise you to keep that promise.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Don't quickly oppose the king or argue when he has already made up his mind.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">The king's word is law. No one can ask him, &amp;apos;Why are you doing this?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">If you obey the king, you will stay out of trouble. So be wise and learn what to do and when to do it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Life is hard, but there is a time and a place for everything,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">though no one can tell the future.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">We cannot control the wind or determine the day of our death. There is no escape in time of war, and no one can hide behind evil.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">I noticed all this and thought seriously about what goes on in the world. Why does one person have the power to hurt another?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">I saw the wicked buried with honor, but God's people had to leave the holy city and were forgotten. None of this makes sense.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">When we see criminals commit crime after crime without being punished, it makes us want to start a life of crime.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">They commit hundreds of crimes and live a long time, in spite of the saying:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">but no one who sins</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">There is something else that doesn't make sense to me. Good citizens are treated as criminals, while criminals are honored as though they were good citizens.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">So I think we should get as much out of life as we possibly can. There is nothing better than to enjoy our food and drink and have a good time. Then we can make it through this troublesome life that God has given us here on earth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Day and night I went without sleep, trying to understand what goes on in this world.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">I saw everything God does, and I realized no one can really understand what happens. We may be very wise, but no matter how much we try or how much we claim to know, we cannot understand it all.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="9">
			<VERS vnumber="1">I thought about these things. Then I understood that God has power over everyone, even those who are wise and live right. Anything can happen to any one of us, and so we never know if life will be good or bad.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">But exactly the same thing will finally happen to all of us, whether we live right and respect God or sin and don't respect God. Yes, the same thing will happen if we offer sacrifices to God or if we don't, if we keep our promises or are afraid to make them. The fastest runners and the greatest heroes don't always win races and battles. Wisdom, intelligence, and skill don't always make you healthy, rich, or popular. We each have our own share of misfortune. make much more sense than the shouts of a ruler to a crowd of fools. than weapons, yet one mistake can destroy all the good you have done.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">It's terribly unfair for the same thing to happen to each of us. We are mean and foolish while we live, and then we die.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">As long as we are alive, we still have hope, just as a live dog is better off than a dead lion.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">We know we will die, but the dead don't know a thing. Nothing good will happen to them&amp;ndash;they are gone and forgotten.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Their loves, their hates, and their jealous feelings have all disappeared with them. They will never again take part in anything that happens on this earth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">So be happy and enjoy eating and drinking! God decided long ago that this is what you should do.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Dress up, comb your hair, and look your best.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Life is short, and you love your wife, so enjoy being with her. This is what you are supposed to do as you struggle through life on this earth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Work hard at whatever you do. You will soon go to the world of the dead, where no one works or thinks or reasons or even knows anything.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Here is something else I have learned:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">None of us know when we might fall victim to a sudden disaster and find ourselves like fish in a net or birds in a trap.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Once I saw what people really think of wisdom, and it made an impression on me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">It happened when a powerful ruler surrounded and attacked a small city where only a few people lived. The enemy army was getting ready to break through the city walls.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">But the city was saved by the wisdom of a poor person who was soon forgotten.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">So I decided that wisdom is better than strength. Yet if you are poor, no one pays any attention to you, no matter how smart you are.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Words of wisdom spoken softly</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Wisdom is more powerful</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1">Hezekiah had been king of Judah for 14 years when King Sennacherib of Assyria invaded the country and captured every walled city</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">except Jerusalem. The Assyrian king ordered his army commander to leave the city of Lachish and to take a large army to Jerusalem. The commander went there and stood on the road near the cloth makers' shops along the canal from the upper pool. I have a message for Hezekiah from the great king of Assyria. Ask Hezekiah why he feels so sure of himself. Listen to what the great king of Assyria says!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Three of the king's highest officials came out of Jerusalem to meet him. One of them was Hilkiah's son Eliakim, who was the prime minister. The other two were Shebna, assistant to the prime minister, and Joah son of Asaph, keeper of the government records.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">The Assyrian commander told them:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Does he think he can plan and win a war with nothing but words? Who is going to help him, now that he has turned against the king of Assyria?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Is he depending on Egypt and its king? That's the same as leaning on a broken stick, and it will go right through his hand.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Is Hezekiah now depending on the Lord , your God? Didn't Hezekiah tear down all except one of the Lord 's altars and places of worship? Didn't he tell the people of Jerusalem and Judah to worship at that one place?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">The king of Assyria wants to make a bet with you people! He will give you 2,000 horses, if you have enough troops to ride them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">How could you even defeat our lowest ranking officer, when you have to depend on Egypt for chariots and cavalry?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Don't forget that it was the Lord who sent me here with orders to destroy your nation!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Eliakim, Shebna, and Joah said, &amp;apos;Sir, we don't want the people listening from the city wall to understand what you are saying. So please speak to us in Aramaic instead of Hebrew.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">The Assyrian army commander answered, &amp;apos;My king sent me to speak to everyone, not just to you leaders. These people will soon have to eat their own body waste and drink their own urine! And so will the three of you!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Then, in a voice loud enough for everyone to hear, he shouted out in Hebrew:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Don't be fooled by Hezekiah. He can't save you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Don't trust him when he tells you that the Lord will protect you from the king of Assyria.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Stop listening to Hezekiah. Pay attention to my king. Surrender to him. He will let you keep your own vineyards, fig trees, and cisterns</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">for a while. Then he will come and take you away to a country just like yours, where you can plant vineyards and raise your own grain.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Hezekiah claims the Lord will save you. But don't be fooled by him. Were any other gods able to defend their land against the king of Assyria?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">What happened to the gods of Hamath, Arpad, and Sepharvaim? Were the gods of Samaria able to protect their land against the Assyrian forces?</VERS>

The people of Jerusalem hate and make fun of you; they laugh behind your back. shouted and sneered at me, the holy One of Israel. insult me, the Lord. And here is what you have said about yourself, &amp;apos;I led my chariots to the highest heights of Lebanon's mountains. I went deep into its forest, cutting down the best cedar and cypress trees. in the land of Egypt, and I drank water from wells I had dug.&amp;apos; to me, the Lord . I planned all of this long ago. And you don't even know that I alone am the one who decided that you would do these things. I let you make ruins of fortified cities. terribly confused.

			<VERS vnumber="14">After Hezekiah had read the note from the king of Assyria, he took it to the temple and spread it out for the Lord to see.</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="32">
			<VERS vnumber="1">The Lord spoke to me in the tenth year that Zedekiah was king of Judah, which was the eighteenth year that Nebuchadnezzar was king of Babylonia.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">At that time, the Babylonian army had surrounded Jerusalem, and I was in the prison at the courtyard of the palace guards.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Zedekiah had ordered me to be held there because I told everyone that the Lord had said: I am the Lord , and I am about to let the king of Babylonia conquer Jerusalem. The Lord had told me to buy it Take both copies of this bill of sale, one sealed shut and the other open, and put them in a clay jar so they will last a long time. I am going to get rid of Jerusalem, because its people have done nothing but evil.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">King Zedekiah will be captured and taken to King Nebuchadnezzar, who will speak with him face to face.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Then Zedekiah will be led away to Babylonia, where he will stay until I am finished with him. So, if you people of Judah fight against the Babylonians, you will lose. I, the Lord , have spoken.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Later, when I was in prison, the Lord said:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Jeremiah, your cousin Hanamel, the son of your uncle Shallum, will visit you. He must sell his field near the town of Anathoth, and because you are his nearest relative, you have the right and the responsibility to buy it and keep it in the family.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Hanamel came, just as the Lord had promised. And he said, &amp;apos;Please buy my field near Anathoth in the territory of the Benjamin tribe. You have the right to buy it, and if you do, it will stay in our family.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">from Hanamel, and so I did. The price was 17 pieces of silver, and I weighed out the full amount on a scale.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">And while he, the witnesses, and all the other Jews sitting in the courtyard were still watching, I gave both copies to Baruch son of Neriah.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">I am the Lord All-Powerful, the God of Israel, and I promise you that people will once again buy and sell houses, farms, and vineyards in this country.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Then I prayed:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Lord God, you stretched out your mighty arm and made the sky and the earth. You can do anything.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">You show kindness for a thousand generations, but you also punish people for the sins of their parents. You are the Lord All-Powerful.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">With great wisdom you make plans, and with your great power you do all the mighty things you planned. Nothing we do is hidden from your eyes, and you reward or punish us as we deserve.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">You are famous because you worked miracles in Egypt, and you are still working them in Israel and in the rest of the world as well.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">You terrified the Egyptians with your miracles, and you reached out your mighty arm and rescued your people Israel from Egypt.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Then you gave Israel this land rich with milk and honey, just as you had promised our ancestors.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">But when our ancestors took over the land, they did not obey you. And now you have punished Israel with disaster.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">Jerusalem is under attack, and we suffer from hunger and disease. The Babylonians have already built dirt ramps up to the walls of our city, and you can see that Jerusalem will be captured just as you said.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">So why did you tell me to get some witnesses and buy a field with my silver, when Jerusalem is about to be captured by the Babylonians?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">The Lord explained:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">Jeremiah, I am the Lord God. I rule the world, and I can do anything!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">It is true that I am going to let King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylonia capture Jerusalem.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">The Babylonian army is already attacking, and they will capture the city and set it on fire. The people of Jerusalem have made me angry by going up to the flat roofs of their houses and burning incense to Baal and offering wine sacrifices to other gods. Now these houses will be burned to the ground!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">They have set up repulsive idols in my temple, and now it isn't a fit place to worship me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">And they led Judah into sin by building places to worship Baal in Hinnom Valley, where they also sacrificed their sons and daughters to the god Molech. I have never even imagined they would commit such disgusting sins.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">Jeremiah, what you said is true. The people of Jerusalem are suffering from hunger and disease, and so the king of Babylonia will be able to capture Jerusalem.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">I am angry with the people of Jerusalem, and I will scatter them in foreign countries. But someday I will bring them back here and let them live in safety.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">They will be my people, and I will be their God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">Even though I have brought disaster on the people, I will someday do all these good things for them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43">Jeremiah, when you bought the field, you showed that fields will someday be bought and sold again. You say that this land has been conquered by the Babylonians and has become a desert, emptied of people and animals.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44">But someday, people will again spend their silver to buy fields everywhere&amp;ndash;in the territory of Benjamin, the region around Jerusalem and the towns of Judah, and in the hill country, the foothills to the west, and the Southern Desert. Buyers and sellers and witnesses will sign and seal the bills of sale for the fields. It will happen, because I will give this land back to my people. I, the Lord , have spoken.</VERS>

I, the Lord , have spoken. when I will appoint a king from the family of David, a king who will be honest and rule with justice. Judah will be safe; Jerusalem will have peace and will be named, &amp;apos;The Lord Gives Justice.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Then someday, I will heal this place and my people as well, and let them enjoy unending peace.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="9">When that happens, all nations on earth will see the good things I have done for Jerusalem, and how I have given it complete peace. The nations will celebrate and praise and honor me, but they will also tremble with fear because of the powerful things I have done.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Jeremiah, you say that this land is a desert without people or animals, and for now, you are right. The towns of Judah and the streets of Jerusalem are deserted, and people and animals are nowhere to be seen. But someday you will hear</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">happy voices and the sounds of parties and wedding celebrations. And when people come to my temple to offer sacrifices to thank me, you will hear them say:</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="16">In those days,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">The king of Israel will be one of David's descendants,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">and there will always be priests from the Levi tribe serving at my altar and offering sacrifices to please me and to give thanks.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Then the Lord told me:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">I, the Lord , have an agreement with day and night, so they always come at the right time. You can't break the agreement I made with them,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">and you can't break the agreements I have made with David's family and with the priests from the Levi tribe who serve at my altar. A descendant of David will always rule as king of Israel,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">and there will be more descendants of David and of the priests from the Levi tribe than stars in the sky or grains of sand on the beach.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">The Lord also said:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">You've heard foreigners insult my people by saying, &amp;apos;The Lord chose Israel and Judah, but now he has rejected them, and they are no longer a nation.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">Jeremiah, I will never break my agreement with the day and the night or let the sky and the earth stop obeying my commands.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">In the same way, I will never reject the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob or break my promise that they will always have a descendant of David as their king. I will be kind to my people Israel, and they will be successful again.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1">I was led away in chains along with the people of Judah and Jerusalem who were being taken to Babylonia. Nebuzaradan was the officer in charge of the guard, and while we were stopped at Ramah, the Lord caused him to set me free.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="4">The next day, the murders had still not been discovered,</VERS>

They were on their way to the temple to offer gifts of grain and incense to the Lord . They had shaved off their beards, torn their clothes, and cut themselves, because they were mourning.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Ishmael went out the town gate to meet them. He pretended to be weeping, and he asked them to come into Mizpah to meet with Gedaliah, the ruler of Judah.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">But after they were inside the town, Ishmael ordered his soldiers to kill them and throw their bodies into a well.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">He let ten of the men live, because they offered to give him supplies of wheat, barley, olive oil, and honey they had hidden in a field.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">The well that he filled with bodies had been dug by King Asa of Judah to store rainwater, because he was afraid that King Baasha of Israel might surround Mizpah and keep the people from getting to their water supply.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1">Johanan, Jezaniah, the other army officers, and everyone else in the group, came to me</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="3">Ask the Lord to tell us where he wants us to go and what he wants us to do.&amp;apos; You asked Jeremiah to pray and find out what you should do. You escaped the disaster that struck Judah, but now the Lord warns you to stay away from Egypt.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="15">People of Judah, you survived when the Babylonian army attacked. Now you are planning to move to Egypt, and if you do go, this is what will happen.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">I, the Lord , was angry with the people of Jerusalem and punished them. And if you go to Egypt, I will be angry and punish you the same way. You will never again see your homeland. People will be horrified at what I do to you, and they will use the name of your city as a curse word.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">I told the people:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">You asked me to pray and find out what the Lord our God wants you to do, and you promised to obey him. But that was a terrible mistake,</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1">I told the people everything the Lord had told me.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="3">Baruch son of Neriah must have told you to say that. He wants the Babylonians to capture us, so they can take us away to Babylonia or even kill us.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Johanan, the other army officers, and everyone else refused to stay in Judah in spite of the Lord 's command.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">So Johanan and the officers led us away toward Egypt. The group that left Judah included those who had been scattered in other countries and who had then come back to live in Judah.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Baruch and I and others in the group had been staying with Gedaliah, because Nebuzaradan, the Babylonian officer in charge of the guard, had ordered him to take care of the king's daughters and quite a few men, women, and children.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">The people disobeyed the Lord and went to Egypt. The group had settled in Tahpanhes,</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="9">Jeremiah, carry some large stones to the entrance of the government building in Tahpanhes. Bury the stones underneath the brick pavement and be sure the Jews are watching.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Then tell them that I, the Lord All-Powerful, the God of Israel, have sent for my servant, Nebuchadnezzar of Babylonia. I will bring him here and have him set up his throne and his royal tent over these stones that I told you to bury.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1">The Lord told me to speak with the Jews who were living in the towns of Migdol, Tahpanhes, and Memphis in northern Egypt, and also to those living in southern Egypt. He told me to tell them: Here in Egypt you still keep your promises to burn incense and offer sacrifices of wine to the so-called Queen of Heaven.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">I am the Lord All-Powerful, the God of Israel. You saw how I destroyed Jerusalem and the towns of Judah. They lie empty and in ruins today,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">because the people of Judah made me angry by worshiping gods that had never helped them or their ancestors.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Time after time I sent my servants the prophets to tell the people of Judah how much I hated their disgusting sins. The prophets warned them to stop sinning,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">but they refused to listen and would not stop worshiping other gods.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Finally, my anger struck like a raging flood, and today Jerusalem and the towns of Judah are nothing but empty ruins.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Why do you now insist on heading for another disaster? A disaster that will destroy not only you, but also your children and babies.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">You have made me angry by worshiping idols and burning incense to other gods after you came here to Egypt. You will die such a disgusting death, that other nations will use the name of Judah as a curse word.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="10">Even now, your pride keeps you from respecting me and obeying the laws and teachings I gave you and your ancestors.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">I, the Lord All-Powerful, have decided to wipe you out with disasters.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">There were only a few of you left in Judah, and you decided to go to Egypt. But you will die such horrible deaths in war or from starvation, that people of other countries will use the name of Judah as a curse word.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">I punished Jerusalem with war, hunger, and disease, and that's how I will punish you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">None of you will survive. You may hope to return to Judah someday, but only a very few of you will escape death and be able to go back.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">A large number of Jews from both northern and southern Egypt listened to me as I told them what the Lord had said. Most of the men in the crowd knew that their wives often burned incense to other gods. So they and their wives shouted:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Jeremiah, what do we care if you speak in the Lord 's name? We refuse to listen!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">We have promised to worship the goddess Astarte, the Queen of Heaven, and that is exactly what we are going to do. We will burn incense and offer sacrifices of wine to her, just as we, our ancestors, our kings, and our leaders did when we lived in Jerusalem and the other towns of Judah. We had plenty of food back then. We were well off, and nothing bad ever happened to us.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">But since the time we stopped burning incense and offering wine sacrifices to her, we have been dying from war and hunger.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Then the women said, &amp;apos;When we lived in Judah, we worshiped the Queen of Heaven and offered sacrifices of wine and special loaves of bread shaped like her. Our husbands knew what we were doing, and they approved of it.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Then I told the crowd:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Don't you think the Lord knew that you and your ancestors, your leaders and kings, and the rest of the people were burning incense to other gods in Jerusalem and everywhere else in Judah?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">And when he could no longer put up with your disgusting sins, he placed a curse on your land and turned it into a desert, as it is today.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">This disaster happened because you worshiped other gods and rebelled against the Lord by refusing to obey him or follow his laws and teachings.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">Keep these promises! But let me tell you what will happen. As surely as I am the Lord God, I swear that I will never again accept any promises you make in my name.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">Instead of watching over you, I will watch for chances to harm you. Some of you will die in war, and others will starve to death.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">Only a few will escape and return to Judah. Then everyone who went to live in Egypt will know that when I say something will happen, it will&amp;ndash;no matter what you say.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">And here is how you will know that I will keep my threats to punish you in Egypt.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1">Zedekiah was 21 years old when he was appointed king of Judah, and he ruled from Jerusalem for eleven years. His mother Hamutal was the daughter of Jeremiah from the town of Libnah.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Zedekiah disobeyed the Lord , just as Jehoiakim had done,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">and it was Zedekiah who finally rebelled against Nebuchadnezzar. The people of Judah and Jerusalem had made the Lord so angry that he finally turned his back on them. That's why horrible things were happening there. The people of Judah no longer lived in their own country. In his seventh year as king, he took 3,023 people. In his eighteenth year as king, he took 832 from Jerusalem. In his twenty-third year as king, his officer Nebuzaradan took 745 people. So, Nebuchadnezzar took a total of 4,600 people from Judah to Babylonia.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">In Zedekiah's ninth year as king, on the tenth day of the tenth month, King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylonia led his entire army to attack Jerusalem. The troops set up camp outside the city and built ramps up to the city walls.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">the Babylonian troops broke through the city wall. That same night, Zedekiah and his soldiers tried to escape through the gate near the royal garden, even though they knew the enemy had the city surrounded. They headed toward the Jordan River valley,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">but the Babylonian troops caught up with them near Jericho. The Babylonians arrested Zedekiah, but his soldiers scattered in every direction.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Zedekiah was taken to Riblah in the land of Hamath, where Nebuchadnezzar put him on trial and found him guilty.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Zedekiah's sons and the officials of Judah were killed while he watched,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">then his eyes were poked out. He was put in chains, then dragged off to Babylon and kept in prison until he died.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Jerusalem was captured during Nebuchadnezzar's nineteenth year as king of Babylonia. About a month later, Nebuchadnezzar's officer in charge of the guards arrived in Jerusalem. His name was Nebuzaradan,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">and he burned down the Lord 's temple, the king's palace, and every important building in the city, as well as all the houses.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Then he ordered the Babylonian soldiers to break down the walls around Jerusalem.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">He led away the people left in the city, including everyone who had become loyal to Nebuchadnezzar, the rest of the skilled workers, and even some of the poor people of Judah.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Only the very poorest were left behind to work the vineyards and the fields.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">For example, the columns were about 8 meters high and 5.5 meters around. They were hollow, but the bronze was about 75 millimeters thick.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Each column had a bronze cap over 2 meters high that was decorated with bronze designs. Some of these designs were like chains and others were like pomegranates.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">There were 96 pomegranates evenly spaced around each column, and a total of 100 pomegranates were located above the chains.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">Next, Nebuzaradan arrested Seraiah the chief priest, Zephaniah his assistant, and three temple officials.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">Then he arrested one of the army commanders, seven of King Zedekiah's personal advisors, and the officer in charge of gathering the troops for battle. He also found 60 more soldiers who were still in Jerusalem.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">Jehoiachin was a prisoner in Babylon for 37 years. Then Evil Merodach became king of Babylonia, and in the first year of his rule, on the twenty-fifth day of the twelfth month, he let Jehoiachin out of prison.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">Evil Merodach was kind to Jehoiachin and honored him more than any of the other kings held prisoner there.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">Jehoiachin was allowed to wear regular clothes instead of a prison uniform, and he even ate at the king's table every day.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">As long as Jehoiachin lived, he was paid a daily allowance to buy whatever he needed.</VERS>

The enemy has won.&amp;apos; Jerusalem saw foreigners enter her place of worship, though the Lord had forbidden them while searching for food; they trade their valuables for barely enough scraps to stay alive. Jerusalem shouts to the Lord , &amp;apos;Please look and see how miserable I am!&amp;apos; Why doesn't someone notice my terrible sufferings? You were fiercely angry, Lord , and you punished me worst of all. that burned in my bones; you set a trap for my feet and made me turn back. All day long you leave me in shock from constant pain. and they weigh so heavily that my strength is gone. You have put me in the power of enemies too strong for me. my warriors and crushed my young heroes. Judah was a woman untouched, but you let her be trampled like grapes in a wine pit. and tears flood my eyes. No one is here to comfort or to encourage me; we have lost the war&amp;ndash; my people are suffering. but no one offers comfort. The Lord has turned the neighboring nations against Jacob's descendants. Jerusalem is merely a filthy rag to her neighbors. but I refused to obey him. Now I ask all of you to look at my sufferings&amp;ndash; even my young people have been dragged away. but they betrayed me. My priests and my leaders died while searching the city for scraps of food. how upset I am, our Lord ? My stomach is in knots, and my heart is broken because I betrayed you. In the streets and at home, my people are slaughtered. but no one offered comfort. My enemies know of the trouble that you have brought on me, and it makes them glad. Hurry and punish them, as you have promised. escape your sight. Punish them as much as you have punished me because of my sins. I never stop groaning&amp;ndash; I've lost all hope!</VERS>

So he disgraced Zion the whole army of Israel the homes on Mount Zion. like a hut in a garden; How great is your pain? about their powerful forces. though it was Israel's pride and his own place of rest. In his anger he threw Zion down from heaven to earth. He destroyed the homes of Jacob's descendants. In his anger he tore down every walled city in Judah; he toppled the nation together with its leaders, leaving them in shame. that he wiped out by not supporting them when the enemy attacked. He was like a raging fire that swallowed up the descendants of Jacob. with a bow and arrows, killing our loved ones. He has burned to the ground He left Israel in ruins with its palaces and fortresses destroyed, and with everyone in Judah moaning and weeping. he completely wiped out his meeting place, and did away with festivals and Sabbaths in the city of Zion. In his fierce anger he rejected our king and priests. and his temple; he let Zion's enemies capture her fortresses. Noisy shouts were heard from the temple, as if it were a time of celebration. to tear down the walls of Zion stone by stone. So he started destroying and did not stop until walls and fortresses mourned and trembled. facedown on the ground; the bars that locked the gates are smashed to pieces. Her king and royal family are prisoners in foreign lands. Her priests don't teach, and her prophets don't have a message from the Lord . They just sit on the ground, tossing dirt on their heads and wearing sackcloth. Her young women can do nothing but stare at the ground. my stomach is in knots, and I feel sick all over. My people are being wiped out, and children lie helpless in the streets of the city. for food and drink, then blacks out like a wounded soldier lying in the street. The child slowly dies in its mother's arms.

At last, we've got you!&amp;apos; that he had planned and threatened long ago. He destroyed you without mercy and let your enemies boast you cried out to the Lord. Now let your tears overflow your walls day and night. Don't ever lose hope or let your tears stop. all through the night. Pour out your feelings to the Lord, as you would pour water out of a jug. Beg him to save your people, who are starving to death at every street crossing. Have you ever been this cruel to anyone before? Is it right for mothers to eat their children, or for priests and prophets to be killed in your temple? lie dead in the streets.

		<CHAPTER cnumber="1">
			<VERS vnumber="4">I saw a windstorm blowing in from the north. Lightning flashed from a huge cloud and lit up the whole sky with a dazzling brightness. The fiery center of the cloud was as shiny as polished metal,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">and in that center I saw what looked like four living creatures. They were somewhat like humans,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">except that each one had four faces and four wings.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Their legs were straight, but their feet looked like the hoofs of calves and sparkled like bronze.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Under each of their wings, these creatures had a human hand.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">The four creatures were standing back to back with the tips of their wings touching. They moved together in every direction, without turning their bodies.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Each creature had the face of a human in front, the face of a lion on the right side, the face of a bull on the left, and the face of an eagle in back.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Two wings of each creature were spread out and touched the wings of the creatures on either side. The other two wings of each creature were folded against its body.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">The four living creatures went wherever the Spirit led them, and they moved together without turning their bodies, because each creature faced straight ahead.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">The creatures were glowing like hot coals, and I saw something like a flaming torch moving back and forth among them. Lightning flashed from the torch every time its flame blazed up.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">The creatures themselves moved as quickly as sparks jumping from a fire.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">I then noticed that on the ground beside each of the four living creatures was a wheel,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">shining like chrysolite. Each wheel was exactly the same and had a second wheel that cut through the middle of it,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">so that they could move in any direction without turning.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">The rims of the wheels were large and frightening, and they had eyes all the way around them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">Whenever the creatures flew, their wings roared like an ocean or a large army or even the voice of God All-Powerful. And whenever the creatures stopped, they folded their wings against their bodies.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">When the creatures stopped flapping their wings, I heard a sound coming from above the dome.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">I then saw what looked like a throne made of sapphire, and sitting on the throne was a figure in the shape of a human.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">From the waist up, it was glowing like metal in a hot furnace, and from the waist down it looked like the flames of a fire. The figure was surrounded by a bright light,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">as colorful as a rainbow that appears after a storm.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="2">
			<VERS vnumber="1">The Lord said, &amp;apos;Ezekiel, son of man, I want you to stand up and listen.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">After he said this, his Spirit took control of me and lifted me to my feet. Then the Lord said: And now, Ezekiel, open your mouth and eat what I am going to give you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Ezekiel, I am sending you to the people of Israel. They are just like their ancestors who rebelled against me and refused to stop.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">They are stubborn and hardheaded. But I, the Lord God, have chosen you to tell them what I say.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Those rebels may not even listen, but at least they will know that a prophet has come to them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Don't be afraid of them or of anything they say. You may think you're in the middle of a thorn patch or a bunch of scorpions. But be brave</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">and preach my message to them, whether they choose to listen or not.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Ezekiel, don't rebel against me, as they have done. Instead, listen to everything I tell you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Just then, I saw a hand stretched out toward me. And in it was a scroll.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">The hand opened the scroll, and both sides of it were filled with words of sadness, mourning, and grief.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="3">
			<VERS vnumber="1">The Lord said, &amp;apos;Ezekiel, son of man, after you eat this scroll, go speak to the people of Israel.&amp;apos; Ezekiel, I am sending you to your own people. The Lord 's power had taken complete control of me, and I was both annoyed and angry. Go back and lock yourself in your house!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">The Lord said:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">But the people of Israel will refuse to listen, because they have refused to listen to me. All of them are stubborn and hardheaded,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">so I will make you as stubborn as they are.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">You will be so determined to speak my message that nothing will stop you. I will make you hard like a diamond, and you'll have no reason to be afraid of those arrogant rebels.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Listen carefully to everything I say and then think about it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Then go to the people who were brought here to Babylonia with you and tell them you have a message from me, the Lord God. Do this, whether they listen to you or not.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">The Spirit lifted me up, and as the glory of the Lord started to leave, I heard a loud, thundering noise behind me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">It was the sound made by the creatures' wings as they brushed against each other, and by the rumble of the wheels beside them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Then the Spirit carried me away.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">When I was back with the others living at Abib Hill near the Chebar River, I sat among them for seven days, shocked at what had happened to me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Seven days after I had seen the brightness of the Lord 's glory, the Lord said:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Ezekiel, son of man, I have appointed you to stand watch for the people of Israel. So listen to what I say, then warn them for me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">When I tell wicked people they will die because of their sins, you must warn them to turn from their sinful ways so they won't be punished. If you refuse, you are responsible for their death.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">However, if you do warn them, and they keep on sinning, they will die because of their sins, and you will be innocent.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Now suppose faithful people start sinning, and I decide to put stumbling blocks in their paths to make them fall. They deserve to die because of their sins. So if you refuse to warn them, I will forget about the times they were faithful, and I will hold you responsible for their death.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">But if you do warn them, and they listen to you and stop sinning, I will let them live. And you will be innocent.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">The Lord took control of me and said, &amp;apos;Stand up! Go into the valley, and I will talk with you there.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">I immediately went to the valley, where I saw the brightness of the Lord 's glory, just as I had seen it near the Chebar River, and I bowed with my face to the ground.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">His Spirit took control of me and lifted me to my feet. Then the Lord said:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">You will be tied up to keep you inside,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">and I will make you unable to talk or to warn those who have rebelled against me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">But the time will come, when I will tell you what to say, and you will again be able to speak my message. Some of them will listen; others will be stubborn and refuse to listen.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1">Ezekiel, son of man, get a sharp sword and use it to cut off your hair and beard. Weigh the hair and divide it into three equal piles.</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="8">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Six years after King Jehoiachin and the rest of us had been led away as prisoners to Babylonia, the leaders of Judah were meeting with me in my house. On the fifth day of the sixth month, the Lord God suddenly took control of me,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">and I saw something in the shape of a human. This figure was like fire from the waist down, and it was bright as polished metal from the waist up.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">It reached out what seemed to be a hand and grabbed my hair. Then in my vision the Lord 's Spirit lifted me into the sky and carried me to Jerusalem. The Spirit took me to the north gate of the temple's inner courtyard, where there was an idol that disgusted the Lord and made him furious.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Then I saw the brightness of the glory of the God of Israel, just as I had seen it near the Chebar River.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">God said to me, &amp;apos;Ezekiel, son of man, look north.&amp;apos; And when I did, I saw that repulsive idol by the altar near the gate.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">God then said, &amp;apos;Do you see the terrible sins of the people of Israel? Their sins are making my holy temple unfit as a place to worship me. Yet you will see even worse things than this.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Next, I was taken to the entrance of the courtyard, where I saw a hole in the wall.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">God said, &amp;apos;Make this hole bigger.&amp;apos; And when I did, I realized it was a doorway.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">&amp;apos;Go in,&amp;apos; God said, &amp;apos;and see what horrible and evil things the people are doing.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Inside, I saw that the walls were covered with pictures of reptiles and disgusting, unclean animals, as well as with idols that the Israelites were worshiping.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Seventy Israelite leaders were standing there, including Jaazaniah son of Shaphan. Each of these leaders was holding an incense burner, and the smell of incense filled the room.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">God said, &amp;apos;Ezekiel, do you see what horrible things Israel's leaders are doing in secret? They have filled their rooms with idols. And they say I can't see them, because they think I have already deserted Israel.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">But I will show you something even worse than this.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">He took me to the north gate of the temple, where I saw women mourning for the god Tammuz.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">God asked me, &amp;apos;Can you believe what these women are doing? But now I want to show you something even worse.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">I was then led into the temple's inner courtyard, where I saw about 25 men standing near the entrance, between the porch and the altar. Their backs were to the Lord 's temple, and they were bowing down to the rising sun.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">God said, &amp;apos;Ezekiel, it's bad enough that the people of Judah are doing these disgusting things. But they have also spread violence and injustice everywhere in Israel and have made me very angry. They have disgraced and insulted me in the worst possible way.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">So in my fierce anger, I will punish them without mercy and refuse to help them when they cry out to me.&amp;apos;</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="9">
			<VERS vnumber="1">After that, I heard the Lord shout, &amp;apos;Come to Jerusalem, you men chosen to destroy the city. And bring your weapons!&amp;apos; The men immediately killed the leaders who were standing there.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">I saw six men come through the north gate of the temple, each one holding a deadly weapon. A seventh man dressed in a linen robe was with them, and he was carrying things to write with. The men went into the temple and stood by the bronze altar.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">The brightness of God's glory then left its place above the statues of the winged creatures inside the temple and moved to the entrance. The Lord said to the man in the linen robe,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">&amp;apos;Walk through the city of Jerusalem and mark the forehead of anyone who is truly upset and sad about the terrible things that are being done here.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Then the Lord said, &amp;apos;Pollute the temple by piling the dead bodies in the courtyards. Now get busy!&amp;apos; They left and started killing the people of Jerusalem.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">I was then alone, so I bowed down and cried out to the Lord , &amp;apos;Why are you doing this? Are you so angry with the people of Jerusalem that everyone must die?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">The Lord answered, &amp;apos;The people of Israel and Judah have done horrible things. Their country is filled with murderers, and Jerusalem itself is filled with violence. They think that I have deserted them, and that I can't see what they are doing.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">And so I will not have pity on them or forgive them. They will be punished for what they have done.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Just then, the man in the linen robe returned and said, &amp;apos;I have done what you commanded.&amp;apos;</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="10">
			<VERS vnumber="1">I saw the dome that was above the four winged creatures, and on it was the sapphire throne.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">The Lord said to the man in the linen robe, &amp;apos;Walk among the four wheels beside the creatures and pick up as many hot coals as you can carry. Then scatter them over the city of Jerusalem.&amp;apos; I watched him as he followed the Lord 's instructions.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">The winged creatures were standing south of the temple when the man walked among them. A cloud filled the inner courtyard,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">and the brightness of the Lord 's glory moved from above the creatures and stopped at the entrance of the temple. The entire temple was filled with his glory, and the courtyard was dazzling bright.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">The sound of the creatures' wings was as loud as the voice of God All-Powerful and could even be heard in the outer courtyard.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">The man in the robe was now standing beside a wheel.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">One of the four creatures reached its hand into the fire among them and gave him some of the hot coals. The man took the coals and left.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">I noticed again that each of the four winged creatures had what looked like human hands under their wings,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">and I saw the four wheels near the creatures. These wheels were shining like chrysolite.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Each wheel was exactly the same and had a second wheel that cut through the middle of it,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">so that they could move in any direction without turning. The wheels moved together whenever the creatures moved.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">I also noticed that the wheels and the creatures' bodies, including their backs, their hands, and their wings, were covered with eyes.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">And I heard a voice calling these &amp;apos;the wheels that spin.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Each of the winged creatures had four faces: the face of a bull, the face of a human, the face of a lion, and the face of an eagle.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Then I watched the brightness of the Lord 's glory move from the entrance of the temple and stop above the winged creatures.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">They spread their wings and flew into the air with the wheels at their side. They stopped at the east gate of the temple, and the Lord 's glory was above them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">I knew for sure that these were the same creatures I had seen beneath the Lord 's glory near the Chebar River.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="11">
			<VERS vnumber="1">The Lord 's Spirit lifted me up and took me to the east gate of the temple, where I saw 25 men, including the two leaders, Jaazaniah son of Azzur and Pelatiah son of Benaiah.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">The Lord said, &amp;apos;Ezekiel, son of man, these men are making evil plans and giving dangerous advice to the people of Jerusalem.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">They say things like, &amp;quot;Let's build more houses. This city is like a cooking pot over a fire, and we are the meat, but at least the pot keeps us from being burned in the fire.&amp;quot;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">So, Ezekiel, condemn them!&amp;apos; I, the Lord God, know what you leaders are saying. It's true that I, the Lord God, have forced you out of your own country and made you live among foreign nations. But for now, I will be with you wherever you are, so that you can worship me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">The Lord 's Spirit took control of me and told me to tell these leaders:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">You have murdered so many people that the city is filled with dead bodies!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">This city is indeed a cooking pot, but the bodies of those you killed are the meat. And so I will force you to leave Jerusalem,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">and I'll send armies to attack you, just as you fear.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Then you will be captured and punished by foreign enemies.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">You will be killed in your own country, but not before you realize that I, the Lord , have done these things.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">You leaders claim to be meat in a cooking pot, but you won't be protected by this city. No, you will die at the border of Israel.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">You will realize that while you were following the laws of nearby nations, you were disobeying my laws and teachings. And I am the Lord !</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Before I finished speaking, Pelatiah dropped dead. I bowed down and cried out, &amp;apos;Please, Lord God, don't kill everyone left in Israel.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">The Lord replied:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Ezekiel, son of man, the people living in Jerusalem claim that you and the other Israelites who were taken to Babylonia are too far away to worship me. They also claim that the land of Israel now belongs only to them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">But here is what I want you to tell the Israelites in Babylonia:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">And someday, I will gather you from the nations where you are scattered and let you live in Israel again.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">When that happens, I want you to clear the land of all those idols I hate so much.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Then I will take away your stubbornness and make you eager to be completely faithful to me. You will want to obey me</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">and all my laws and teachings. You will be my people, and I will be your God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">But those who worship idols will be punished and get what they deserve. I, the Lord God, have spoken.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">After the Lord had finished speaking, the winged creatures spread their wings and flew into the air, and the wheels were beside them. The brightness of the Lord 's glory above them</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">left Jerusalem and stopped at a hill east of the city.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">Then in my vision, the Lord 's Spirit lifted me up and carried me back to the other exiles in Babylonia. The vision faded away,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">and I told them everything the Lord had shown me.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="12">
			<VERS vnumber="1">The Lord said: Later that evening leave your house as if you were going into exile. The Lord God has a message for the leader of Jerusalem and everyone living there!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Ezekiel, son of man, you are living among rebellious people. They have eyes, but refuse to see; they have ears, but refuse to listen.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">So before it gets dark, here is what I want you to do. Pack a few things as though you were going to be taken away as a prisoner. Then go outside where everyone can see you and walk around from place to place. Maybe as they watch, they will realize what rebels they are.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">After you have done this, return to your house.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Dig through the wall of your house and crawl out, carrying the bag with you. Make sure everyone is watching.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Lift the bag to your shoulders, and with your face covered, take it into the darkness, so that you cannot see the land you are leaving. All this will be a warning for the people of Israel.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">I did everything the Lord had said. I packed a few things. Then as the sun was going down, and while everyone was watching, I dug a hole through one of the walls of my house. I pulled out my bag, then lifted it to my shoulders and left in the darkness.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">The next morning, the Lord</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">reminded me that those rebellious people didn't even ask what I was doing.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">So he sent me back to tell them:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">I have done these things to show them what will happen when they are taken away as prisoners.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">The leader of Jerusalem will lift his own bag to his shoulders at sunset and leave through a hole that the others have dug in the wall of his house. He will cover his face, so he can't see the land he is leaving.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">The Lord will spread out a net and trap him as he leaves Jerusalem. He will then be led away to the city of Babylon, but will never see that place, even though he will die there.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">His own officials and troops will scatter in every direction, and the Lord will track them down and put them to death.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">The Lord will force the rest of the people in Jerusalem to live in foreign nations, where they will realize that he has done all these things.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Some of them will survive the war, the starvation, and the deadly diseases. That way, they will be able to tell foreigners how disgusting their sins were, and that it was the Lord who punished them in this way.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">The Lord said:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Ezekiel, son of man, shake with fear when you eat, and tremble when you drink.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Tell the people of Israel that I, the Lord , say that someday everyone in Jerusalem will shake when they eat and tremble when they drink. Their country will be destroyed and left empty, because they have been cruel and violent.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Every town will lie in ruins, and the land will be a barren desert. Then they will know that I am the Lord .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">The Lord said:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Ezekiel, son of man, you've heard people in Israel use the saying, &amp;apos;Time passes, and prophets are proved wrong.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">Now tell the people that I, the Lord , am going to prove that saying wrong. No one will ever be able to use it again in Israel, because very soon everything I have said will come true!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">The people will hear no more useless warnings and false messages.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">I will give them my message, and what I say will certainly happen. Warn those rebels that the time has come for them to be punished. I, the Lord , make this promise.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">So tell them that my words will soon come true, just as I have warned. I, the Lord , have spoken.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="13">
			<VERS vnumber="1">The Lord said:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Ezekiel, son of man, condemn the prophets of Israel who say they speak in my name, but who preach messages that come from their own imagination. Tell them it's time to hear my message.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">I, the Lord God, say those lying prophets are doomed! They don't see visions&amp;ndash;they make up their own messages!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Israel's prophets are no better than jackals that hunt for food among the ruins of a city.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">They don't warn the people about coming trouble or tell them how dangerous it is to sin against me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Those prophets lie by claiming they speak for me, but I have not even chosen them to be my prophets. And they still think their words will come true.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">They say they're preaching my messages, but they are full of lies&amp;ndash;I did not speak to them!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">So I am going to punish those lying prophets for deceiving the people of Israel with false messages.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">I will turn against them and no longer let them belong to my people. They will not be allowed to call themselves Israelites or even to set foot in Israel. Then they will realize that I am the Lord God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Those prophets refuse to be honest. They tell my people there will be peace, even though there's no peace to be found. They are like workers who think they can fix a shaky wall by covering it with paint.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">But when I send rainstorms, hailstones, and strong winds, the wall will surely collapse.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">People will then ask the workers why the paint didn't hold it up.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">That wall is the city of Jerusalem. And I, the Lord God, am so angry that I will send strong winds, rainstorms, and hailstones to destroy it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">The lying prophets have tried to cover up the evil in Jerusalem, but I will tear down the city, all the way to its foundations. And when it collapses, those prophets will be killed, and everyone will know that I have done these things.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">The city of Jerusalem and its lying prophets will feel my fierce anger. Then I will announce that the city has fallen and that the lying prophets are dead,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">because they promised my people peace, when there was no peace. I, the Lord God, have spoken.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Ezekiel, son of man, now condemn the women of Israel who preach messages that come from their own imagination.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Tell them they're doomed! They wear magic charms on their wrists and scarves on their heads, then trick others into believing they can predict the future. They won't get away with telling those lies.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">They charge my people a few handfuls of barley and a couple pieces of bread, and then give messages that are insulting to me. They use lies to sentence the innocent to death and to help the guilty go free. And my people believe them!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">I hate the magic charms they use to trick people into believing their lies. I will rip those charms from their wrists and set free the people they have trapped like birds.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">I will tear the scarves from their heads and rescue my people from their power once and for all. Then they will know that I am the Lord God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">They do things I would never do. They lie to good people and encourage them to do wrong, and they convince the wicked to ruin their own lives by not turning from sin.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">I will no longer let these women give false messages and use magic, and I will free my people from their control. Then they will know that I, the Lord , have done these things.</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="14">
			<VERS vnumber="1">One day, some of Israel's leaders came to me and asked for a message from the Lord .</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="3">Ezekiel, son of man, these men have started worshiping idols, though they know it will cause them to sin even more. So I refuse to give them a message!</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="8">by turning against you. I will make you a warning to anyone who might think of doing the same thing, and you will no longer belong to my people. Then you will know that I am the Lord and that you have sinned against me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">If a prophet gives a false message, I am the one who caused that prophet to lie. But I will still reject him and cut him off from my people,</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="11">I will do this, so that you will come back to me and stop destroying yourselves with these disgusting sins. So turn back to me! Then I will be your God, and you will be my people. I, the Lord God, make this promise.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="2">Ezekiel, son of man, what happens to the wood of a grapevine after the grapes have been picked? It isn't like other trees in the forest,</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="4">It can only be used as firewood. But after its ends are burnt and its middle is charred, it can't be used for anything.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">The wood is useless before it is burned, and afterwards, it is completely worthless.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">I, the Lord God, promise that just as the wood of a grapevine is burned as firewood,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">I will punish the people of Jerusalem with fire. Some of them have escaped one destruction, but soon they will be completely burned. And when that happens, you, Ezekiel, will know that I am the Lord .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">I will make their country an empty wasteland, because they have not been loyal to me. I, the Lord God, have spoken.</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="16">
			<VERS vnumber="1">The Lord said:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Ezekiel, son of man, remind the people of Jerusalem of their disgusting sins</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">and tell them that I, the Lord God, am saying: Jerusalem, you were born in the country where Canaanites lived. Your father was an Amorite, and your mother was a Hittite.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">When you were born, no one cut you loose from your mother or washed your body. No one rubbed your skin with salt and olive oil, and wrapped you in warm blankets.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Not one person loved you enough to do any of these things, and no one even felt sorry for you. You were despised, thrown into a field, and forgotten.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">I saw you lying there, rolling around in your own blood, and I couldn't let you die.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">I took care of you, like someone caring for a tender, young plant. You grew up to be a beautiful young woman with mature breasts and hair, but you were still naked.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">When I saw you again, you were old enough to have sex. So I covered your naked body with my own robe. Then I solemnly promised that you would belong to me and that I, the Lord God, would take care of you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">I washed the blood off you and rubbed your skin with olive oil.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">I gave you the finest clothes and the most expensive robes, as well as sandals made from the best leather.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">I gave you bracelets, a necklace,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">a ring for your nose, some earrings, and a beautiful crown.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Your jewelry was gold and silver, and your clothes were made of only the finest material and embroidered linen. Your bread was baked from fine flour, and you ate honey and olive oil. You were as beautiful as a queen,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">and everyone on earth knew it. I, the Lord God, had helped you become a lovely young woman.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">You learned that you were attractive enough to have any man you wanted, so you offered yourself to every passerby.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">You made shrines for yourself and decorated them with some of your clothes. That's where you took your visitors to have sex with them. These things should never have happened!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">You made idols out of the gold and silver jewelry I gave you, then you sinned by worshiping those idols.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">You dressed them in the clothes you got from me, and you offered them the olive oil and incense I gave you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">I supplied you with fine flour, olive oil, and honey, but you sacrificed it all as offerings to please those idols. I, the Lord God, watched this happen.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">But you did something even worse than that&amp;ndash;you sacrificed your own children to those idols!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">You slaughtered my children, so you could offer them as sacrifices.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">You were so busy sinning and being a prostitute that you refused to think about the days when you were young and were rolling around naked in your own blood.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">Now I, the Lord God, say you are doomed! Not only did you do these evil things,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">but you also built places on every street corner</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">where you disgraced yourself by having sex with anyone who walked by. And you did that more and more every day!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">To make me angry, you even offered yourself to Egyptians, who were always ready to sleep with you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">So I punished you by letting those greedy Philistine enemies take over some of your territory. But even they were offended by your repulsive behavior.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">You couldn't get enough sex, so you chased after Assyrians and slept with them. You still weren't satisfied,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">so you went after Babylonians. But those merchants could not satisfy you either.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">I, the Lord God, say that you were so disgusting that you would have done anything to get what you wanted.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">You had sex on every street corner, and when you finished, you refused to accept money. That's worse than being a prostitute!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">You are nothing but an unfaithful wife who would rather have sex with strangers than with your own husband.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">Prostitutes accept money for having sex, but you bribe men from everywhere to have sex with you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">You're not like other prostitutes. Men don't ask you for sex&amp;ndash;you offer to pay them!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">Jerusalem, you prostitute, listen to me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">You chased after lovers, then took off your clothes and had sex. You even worshiped disgusting idols and sacrificed your own children as offerings to them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">So I, the Lord God, will gather every one of your lovers, those you liked and those you hated. They will stand around you, and I will rip off your clothes and let all of those lovers stare at your nakedness.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">I will find you guilty of being an unfaithful wife and a murderer, and in my fierce anger I will sentence you to a violent death!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">Then I will hand you over to your lovers, who will tear down the places where you had sex. They will take your clothes and jewelry, leaving you naked and empty-handed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">Your lovers and an angry mob will stone you to death; they will cut your dead body into pieces</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">and burn down your houses. Other women will watch these terrible things happen to you. I promise to stop you from being a prostitute and paying your lovers for sex.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">Only then will I calm down and stop being angry and jealous.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43">You made me furious by doing all these disgusting things and by forgetting how I took care of you when you were young. Then you made things worse by acting like a prostitute. You must be punished! I, the Lord God, have spoken.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44">People will use this saying about you, Jerusalem: &amp;apos;If the mother is bad, so is her daughter.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45">You are just like your mother, who hated her husband and her own children. You are also like your sisters, who hated their husbands and children. Your father was an Amorite, and your mother was a Hittite.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46">Your older sister was Samaria, that city to your north with her nearby villages. Your younger sister was Sodom, that city to your south with her nearby villages.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="47">You followed their way of life and their wicked customs, and soon you were more repulsive than they were.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="48">As surely as I am the living Lord God, the people of Sodom and its nearby villages were never as sinful as you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="49">They were arrogant and spoiled; they had everything they needed and still refused to help the poor and needy.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="50">They thought they were better than everyone else, and they did things I hate. And so I destroyed them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="51">You people of Jerusalem have sinned twice as much as the people of Samaria. In fact, your evil ways have made both Sodom and Samaria look innocent.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="52">So their punishment will seem light compared to yours. You will be disgraced and put to shame because of your disgusting sins.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="53">Someday I will bless Sodom and Samaria and their nearby villages. I will also bless you, Jerusalem.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="54">Then you will be ashamed of how you've acted, and Sodom and Samaria will be relieved that they weren't as sinful as you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="55">When that day comes, you and Sodom and Samaria will once again be well-off, and all nearby villages will be restored.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="56">Jerusalem, you were so arrogant that you sneered at Sodom.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="57">But now everyone has learned how wicked you really are. The countries of Syria and Philistia, as well as your other neighbors, hate you and make insulting remarks.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="58">You must pay for all the vulgar and disgusting things you have done. I, the Lord , have spoken.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="59">Jerusalem, you deserve to be punished, because you broke your promises and ignored our agreement.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="60">But I remember the agreement I made with you when you were young, and so I will make you a promise that will last forever.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="61">When you think about how you acted, you will be ashamed, especially when I return your sisters to you as daughters, even though this was not part of our agreement.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="62">I will keep this solemn promise, and you will know that I am the Lord .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="63">I will forgive you, but you will think about your sins and be too ashamed to say a word. I, the Lord God, have spoken.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="5">The eagle also took a seed from Israel and planted it in a fertile field with plenty of water, like a willow tree beside a stream.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">The seed sprouted and grew into a grapevine that spread over the ground. It had lots of leaves and strong, deep roots, and its branches grew upward toward the eagle.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">There was another eagle with strong wings and thick feathers. The roots and branches of the grapevine soon turned toward this eagle, hoping it would bring water for the soil.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">But the vine was already growing in fertile soil, where there was plenty of water to produce healthy leaves and large grapes.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Now tell me, Ezekiel, do you think this grapevine will live? Or will the first eagle pull it up by its roots and pluck off the grapes and let its new leaves die? The eagle could easily kill it without the help of a large and powerful army.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">The grapevine is strong and healthy, but as soon as the scorching desert wind blows, it will quickly wither.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">The Lord said:</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="4">Are you willing to warn them, Ezekiel? Then remind them of the disgusting sins of their ancestors.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="6">I swore that I would rescue them from Egypt and lead them to a land I had already chosen. This land was rich with milk and honey and was the most splendid land of all.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">I told them to get rid of their disgusting idols and not to sin by worshiping the gods of Egypt. I reminded them that I was the Lord their God,</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="14">But that would have disgraced me, because many other nations had seen me bring the Israelites out of Egypt.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Instead, I told them in the desert that I would not lead them into the beautiful, fertile land I had promised.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">I said this because they had not only ignored my laws and teachings, but had disgraced my Sabbath and worshiped idols.</VERS>

My slaughtering sword is waiting at every gate, wherever the blade is pointed. and I will clap my hands in victory. I, the Lord , have spoken. Everything you do is wicked and shows how sinful you are. You are guilty and will be taken away as prisoners. Ezekiel, son of man, the Ammonites have insulted Israel, so condemn them and tell them I am saying: A sword is drawn, ready to slaughter; it is polished and prepared to kill as fast as lightning.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="25">Their leaders are like roaring lions, tearing apart their victims. They put people to death, then steal everything of value. Husbands are killed, and many women are left as widows.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">The priests of Israel ignore my Law! Not only do they refuse to respect any of my sacred things, but they don't even teach the difference between what is sacred and what is ordinary or between what is clean and what is unclean.

			<VERS vnumber="27">Israel's officials are like ferocious wolves, ripping their victims apart. They make a dishonest living by injuring and killing people.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">And then the prophets in Israel cover up these sins by giving false visions. I have never spoken to them, but they lie and say they have a message from me.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="30">I looked for someone to defend the city and to protect it from my anger, as well as to stop me from destroying it. But I found no one.</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="23">
			<VERS vnumber="1">The Lord said: I will call together an angry mob that will abuse and rob you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Ezekiel, son of man, listen to this story about two sisters.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">While they were young and living in Egypt, they became prostitutes.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">The older one was named Oholah, which stands for Samaria; the younger one was Oholibah, which stands for Jerusalem. They became my wives and gave birth to my children.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Even though Oholah was my wife, she continued to be a prostitute and chased after Assyrian lovers.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">She offered herself to soldiers in purple uniforms: handsome, high-ranking officers and cavalry troops.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">She had sex with all the important Assyrian officials and even worshiped their disgusting idols.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Once she started doing these things in Egypt, she never stopped. Men slept with her, and she was always ready for sex.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">So I gave Oholah to the Assyrian lovers she wanted so badly.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">They ripped off her clothes, then captured her children and killed her. Women everywhere talked about what had happened to Oholah.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Oholibah saw all this, but she was more sinful and wanted sex more than her sister Oholah ever did.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Oholibah also chased after good-looking Assyrian officers, uniformed soldiers, and cavalry troops.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Just like her sister, she did vulgar things.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">But Oholibah behaved worse than her sister. Oholibah saw images of Babylonian men carved into walls and painted red.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">They had belts around their waists and large turbans on their heads, and they reminded her of Babylonian cavalry officers.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">As soon as she looked at them, she wanted to have sex with them. And so, she sent messengers to bring them to her.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Men from Babylonia came and had sex with her so many times that she got disgusted with them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">She let everyone see her naked body and didn't care if they knew she was a prostitute. That's why I turned my back on her, just as I had done with her older sister.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Oholibah didn't stop there, but became even more immoral and acted as she had back in Egypt.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">She eagerly wanted to go to bed with Egyptian men, who were famous for their sexual powers.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">And she longed for the days when she was a young prostitute, when men enjoyed caressing her body.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">The Lord God said: Oholibah, though you no longer want to be around your lovers, they will surround you like enemies, when I turn them against you. Ezekiel, son of man, it's time for you to tell Oholah and Oholibah that they are guilty. Remind them of their evil ways!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">I will gather all the handsome young officials and the high-ranking cavalry officers from Babylonia and Assyria, as well as from the Chaldean tribes of Pekod, Shoa, and Koa.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">Their large armies will come from the north with chariots and wagons carrying weapons. They will wear shields and helmets and will surround you, and I will let them judge and sentence you according to their own laws.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">I am angry with you, so I will let them be very cruel. They will cut off your nose and ears; they will kill your children and burn alive anyone in your family who survives.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">Your clothes and jewelry will be torn off.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">I will stop your wickedness and the prostitution you started back in Egypt. You will never want to think about those days again.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">I, the Lord God, am ready to hand you over to those hateful enemies that you find so disgusting.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">They will cruelly take away everything you have worked for and strip you naked. Then everyone will see you for the prostitute you really are. Your own vulgar sins</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">have led to this. You were the one determined to have sex with men from other nations and to worship their idols.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">You have turned out no better than your older sister, and now you must drink from the cup filled with my anger.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">I, the Lord God, gave your sister a large, deep cup filled with my anger. And when you drink from that cup, you will be mocked and insulted.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">You will end up drunk and devastated, because that cup is filled with horror and ruin.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">But you must drink every drop! Then smash the cup and chew on its broken pieces. Use them to cut your breasts in sorrow. I, the Lord God, have spoken.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">You have completely rejected me, and so I promise that you will be punished for the disgusting things you did as a prostitute.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">The Lord said:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">They have been unfaithful by worshiping idols, and they have committed murder by sacrificing my own children as offerings to idols.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">They sent messengers to attract men from far away. When those men arrived, the two sisters bathed themselves and put on eye shadow and jewelry.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">They sat on a fancy couch, and in front of them was a table for the olive oil and incense that had belonged to me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">Their room was always filled with a noisy crowd of drunkards brought in from the desert. These men gave the women bracelets and beautiful crowns,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43">and I noticed that the men were eager to have sex with these women, though they were exhausted from being prostitutes.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44">In fact, the men had sex over and over with Oholah and Oholibah, the two sinful sisters.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45">But honest judges will someday accuse those two of murder and of being unfaithful, because they are certainly guilty.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46">So I, the Lord God, now say to these sisters:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="47">They will stone you to death and cut you to pieces; they will kill your children and burn down your houses.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="48">I will get rid of sinful prostitution in this country, so that women everywhere will be warned not to act as you have.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="49">You will be punished for becoming prostitutes and for worshiping idols. Then you will know that I am the Lord God.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1">Nine years after King Jehoiachin and the rest of us had been led away as prisoners to Babylonia, the Lord spoke to me on the tenth day of the tenth month.

			<VERS vnumber="7">The people of Jerusalem murdered innocent people in the city and didn't even try to cover up the blood that flowed out on the hard ground.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">But I have seen that blood, and it cries out for me to take revenge.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">I, the Lord God, will punish that city of violence! I will make a huge pile of firewood,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">so bring more wood and light it. Cook the meat and boil away the broth to let the bones scorch.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Then set the empty pot over the hot coals until it is red-hot. That will clean the pot and burn off the rust.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">I've tried everything else. Now the rust must be burned away.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Jerusalem is so full of sin and evil that I can't get it clean, even though I have tried. It will stay filthy until I let loose my fierce anger against it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">That time will certainly come! And when it does, I won't show the people of Jerusalem any pity or change my mind. They must be punished for the evil they have done. I, the Lord God, have spoken.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">The Lord said,</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="22">Then you will do the same things I have done. You will leave your face uncovered and refuse to eat the food that mourners usually eat.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">You won't take off your turbans and your sandals. You won't cry or mourn, but all day long you will go around groaning because of your sins.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">I am a warning sign&amp;ndash;everything I have done, you will also do. And then you will know the Lord God has made these things happen.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">The Lord said, &amp;apos;Ezekiel, I will soon destroy the temple that makes everyone feel proud and safe, and I will take away their children as well.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">On that same day, someone will escape from the city and come to tell you what has happened.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="3">In my vision the Lord took me closer, and I saw a man who was sparkling like polished bronze. He was standing near one of the gates and was holding a tape measure in one hand and a measuring stick in the other.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">The man said, &amp;apos;Ezekiel, son of man, pay close attention to everything I'm going to show you&amp;ndash;that's why you've been brought here. Listen carefully, because you must tell the people of Israel what you see.&amp;apos; At the far end of this passageway, I saw an entrance room that faced the courtyard of the temple itself. There was also a distance of three meters between the last guardroom and the entrance room</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">The first thing I saw was an outer wall that completely surrounded the temple area. The man took his measuring stick, which was three meters long, and measured the wall; it was three meters high and three meters thick.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">The three guardrooms on each side of the passageway were the same size, and the walls that separated them were the same thickness.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Next, the man measured the width of the passageway, and it was six and a half meters, but the two doors of the gate were only five meters wide.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">In front of the guardrooms, which were three meters square, was a railing about 50 centimeters high and 50 centimeters thick.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">The man measured the distance from the back wall of one of these rooms to the same spot in the room directly across the passageway, and it was twelve and a half meters.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">He measured the entrance room at the far end of the passageway, and it was ten meters wide.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Finally, he measured the total length of the passageway, from the outer wall to the entrance room, and it was 25 meters.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">The three walls in the guardrooms had small windows in them, just like the ones in the entrance room. The walls along the passageway were decorated with carvings of palm trees.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">The man then led me through the passageway and into the outer courtyard of the temple, where I saw 30 rooms built around the outside of the courtyard. These side rooms were built against the outer wall, and in front of them was a sidewalk that circled the courtyard.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">This was known as the lower sidewalk, and it was 25 meters wide.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">I saw the gates that led to the inner courtyard of the temple and noticed that they were higher than those leading to the outer courtyard. The man measured the distance between the outer and inner gates, and it was 50 meters.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Next, the man measured the north gate that led to the outer courtyard.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">This gate also had three guardrooms on each side of a passageway. The measurements of these rooms, the walls between them, and the entrance room at the far end of the passageway were exactly the same as those of the east gate. The north gate was also 25 meters long and 12.5 meters wide,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">and the windows, the entrance room, and the carvings of palm trees were just like those in the east gate. The entrance room also faced the courtyard of the temple and had seven steps leading up to it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">Directly across the outer courtyard was a gate that led to the inner courtyard, just as there was for the east gate. The man measured the distance between the outer and inner gate, and it was 50 meters.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">The man then took me to the south gate. He measured the walls and the entrance room of this gate, and the measurements were exactly the same as those of the other two gates.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">There were windows in the guardrooms of this gate and in the entrance room, just like the others, and this gate was also 25 meters long and 12.5 meters wide.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">Seven steps led up to the gate; the entrance room was at the far end of the passageway and faced the courtyard of the temple. Carvings of palm trees decorated the walls along the passageway.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">And directly across the outer courtyard was a gate on the south side of the inner courtyard. The man measured the distance between the outer and inner gate, and it was also 50 meters.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">We then went into the inner courtyard, through the gate on the south side of the temple. The man measured the gate, and it was the same size as the gates in the outer wall.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">The entrance room of this gate faced the outer courtyard, and carvings of palm trees decorated the walls of the passageway. Eight steps led up to this gate.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">Next, we went through the east gate to the inner courtyard. The man measured this gate, and it was the same size as the others.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">The guardrooms, the walls separating them, and its entrance room had the same measurements as the other gates. The guardrooms and the entrance room had windows, and the gate was 25 meters long and 12.5 meters wide.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">The entrance room faced the outer courtyard, and the walls in the passageway were decorated with carvings of palm trees. Eight steps also led up to this gate.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">Then the man took me to the north gate. He measured it, and it was the same size as the others,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">including the guardrooms, the walls separating them, and the entrance room. There were also windows in this gate. It was 25 meters long and 12.5 meters wide,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">and like the other inner gates, its entrance room faced the outer courtyard, and its walls were decorated with carvings of palm trees. Eight steps also led up to this gate.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">Four more tables were in the outer courtyard, two on each side of the steps leading into the entrance room.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">So there was a total of eight tables, four inside and four outside, where the animals were killed,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44">The man then took me to the inner courtyard, where I saw two buildings, one beside the inner gate on the north and the other beside the inner gate on the south.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45">He said, &amp;apos;The building beside the north gate belongs to the priests who serve in the temple,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46">and the building beside the south gate belongs to those who serve at the altar. All of them are descendants of Zadok and are the only Levites allowed to serve as the Lord 's priests.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="47">Now the man measured the inner courtyard; it was 50 meters square. I also saw an altar in front of the temple.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="48">We walked to the porch of the temple, and the man measured the doorway of the porch: It was seven meters long, two and a half meters wide, and the distance from the doorway to the wall on either side was one and a half meters.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="49">The porch itself was ten meters by six meters, with steps leading up to it. There was a column on each side of these steps.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="41">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Next we went into the main room of the temple. The man measured the doorway of this room: It was 3 meters wide,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">five meters long, and the distance from the doorway to the wall on either side was two and a half meters. The main room itself was 20 meters by 10 meters. In front of the doorway to the most holy place was something that looked like</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">The man measured the wall of the temple, and it was three meters thick. Storage rooms two meters wide were built against the outside of the wall.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">There were three levels of rooms, with 30 rooms on each level, and they rested on ledges that were attached to the temple walls, so that nothing was built into the walls.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">The walls of the temple were thicker at the bottom than at the top, which meant that the storage rooms on the top level were wider than those on the bottom level. Steps led from the bottom level, through the middle level, and into the top level.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">The temple rested on a stone base three meters high, which also served as the foundation for the storage rooms.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">The outside walls of the storage rooms were two and a half meters thick; there was nothing between these walls</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">and the nearest buildings ten meters away.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">One door led into the storage rooms on the north side of the temple, and another door led to those on the south side. The stone base extended two and a half meters beyond the outside wall of the storage rooms.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">I noticed another building: It faced the west end of the temple and was 35 meters wide, 45 meters long, and had walls over 2.5 meters thick.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">The man measured the length of the temple, and it was 50 meters. He then measured from the back wall of the temple, across the open space behind the temple, to the back wall of the west building; it was 50 meters.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">The distance across the front of the temple, including the open space on either side, was also 50 meters.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Finally, the man measured the length of the west building, including the side rooms on each end, and it was also 50 meters. The inside walls of the temple's porch and main room</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">were paneled with wood all the way from the floor to the windows, while the doorways, the small windows, and the three side rooms were trimmed in wood.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">The paneling stopped just above the doorway. These walls were decorated</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">The doorframe to the temple's main room was in the shape of a rectangle.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">a wooden altar. It was one and a half meters high and one meter square, and its corners, its base, and its sides were made of wood. The man said, &amp;apos;This is a reminder that the Lord is constantly watching over his temple.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">Both the doorway to the main room of the temple and the doorway to the most holy place had two doors,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">and each door had two sections that could fold open.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">The doors to the main room were decorated with carvings of winged creatures and palm trees just like those on the walls, and there was a wooden covering over the porch just outside these doors.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">The walls on each side of this porch had small windows and were also decorated with carvings of palm trees.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="3">On one side of them was the 10 meters of open space that ran alongside the temple, and on the other side was the sidewalk that circled the outer courtyard. The rooms were arranged in three levels</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">with doors that opened toward the north, and in front of them was a walkway five meters wide and 50 meters long.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">The rooms on the top level were narrower than those on the middle level, and the rooms on the middle level were narrower than those on the bottom level.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">The rooms on the bottom level supported those on the two upper levels, and so these rooms did not have columns like other buildings in the courtyard.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">These rooms were exactly like those on the north side, and they also had a walkway in front of them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">The door to these rooms was at the east end of the wall that stood in front of them. These rooms on the north and south sides of the temple are the sacred rooms where the Lord 's priests will eat the most holy offerings. These offerings include the grain sacrifices, the sacrifices for sin, and the sacrifices to make things right.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">The man then said to me:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">When the priests are ready to leave the temple, they must go through these rooms before they return to the outer courtyard. They must leave their sacred clothes in these rooms and put on regular clothes before going anywhere near other people.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">After the man had finished measuring the buildings inside the temple area, he took me back through the east gate and measured the wall around this area.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">He used his measuring stick to measure the east side of this wall; it was 250 meters long.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">and so the temple area was a perfect square. The wall around this area separated what was sacred from what was ordinary.</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="43">
			<VERS vnumber="1">The man took me back to the east gate of the temple,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">where I saw the brightness of the glory of Israel's God coming from the east. The sound I heard was as loud as ocean waves, and everything around was shining with the dazzling brightness of his glory.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">This vision was like the one I had seen when God came to destroy Jerusalem and like the one I had seen near the Chebar River. I immediately bowed with my face to the ground, Ezekiel, son of man, after the altar is built, it must be dedicated by offering sacrifices on it and by splattering it with blood. Here is what you must do:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">and the Lord 's glory came through the east gate and into the temple.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">The Lord 's Spirit lifted me to my feet and carried me to the inner courtyard, where I saw that the Lord 's glory had filled the temple.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">The man was standing beside me, and I heard the Lord say from inside the temple:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Ezekiel, son of man, this temple is my throne on earth. I will live here among the people of Israel forever. They and their kings will never again disgrace me by worshiping idols at local shrines or by setting up memorials to their dead kings.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Israel's kings built their palaces so close to my holy temple that only a wall separated them from me. Then these kings disgraced me with their evil ways, and in my fierce anger I destroyed them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">But if the people and their kings stop worshiping other gods and tear down those memorials, I will live among them forever.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">The people of Israel must suffer shame for sinning against me, so tell them about my holy temple. Let them think about it,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">then if they are truly sorry, describe for them the design and shape of the temple, the gates, the measurements, and how the buildings are arranged. Explain the regulations about worshiping there, then write down these things, so they can study and obey them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">The temple area on my holy mountain must be kept sacred! This is the most important law about the temple.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">According to the official standards, the altar in the temple had the following measurements: Around the bottom of the altar was a gutter 50 centimeters wide and 50 centimeters deep, with a 25-centimeter ledge on the outer rim.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">The Lord God said:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">The priests of the Levi tribe from the family of Zadok the priest are the only ones who may serve in my temple&amp;ndash;this is my law. So give them a young bull to slaughter as a sacrifice for sin.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Take some of the animal's blood and smear it on the four corners of the altar, some on the corners of the middle section, and some more on the rim around its edge. That will purify the altar and make it fit for offering sacrifices to me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Then take the body of the bull outside the temple area and burn it at the special place.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">The next day, a goat that has nothing wrong with it must be offered as a sacrifice for sin. Purify the altar with its blood, just as you did with the blood of the bull.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">Then choose a young bull and a young ram that have nothing wrong with them,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">and bring them to my temple. The priests will sprinkle salt on them and offer them as sacrifices to please me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">Each day for the next seven days, you must offer a goat and a bull and a ram as sacrifices for sin. These animals must have nothing wrong with them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">The priests will purify the altar during those days, so that it will be acceptable to me and ready to use.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">From then on, the priests will use this altar to offer sacrifices to please me and sacrifices to ask my blessing. Then I will be pleased with the people of Israel. I, the Lord God, have spoken.</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="44">
			<VERS vnumber="1">The man took me back to the outer courtyard, near the east gate of the temple area. I saw that the doors to this gate were closed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">The Lord said: I, the Lord God of Israel, came through this gate, so it must remain closed forever! No one must ever use it. Ezekiel, son of man, I am going to give you the laws for my temple. So pay attention and listen carefully to what kind of people are allowed to come in the temple, and what kind are not. I, the Lord God, command you to stop your evil ways!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">The ruler of Israel may come here to eat a sacrificial meal that has been offered to me, but he must use only the entrance room of this gate.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Then the man took me through the north gate to the front of the temple. I saw that the brightness of the Lord 's glory had filled the temple, and I immediately bowed with my face to the ground.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">The Lord said:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Tell those rebellious people of Israel:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">My temple has been disgraced, because you have let godless, stubborn foreigners come here when sacrifices are being offered to me. You have sinned and have broken our solemn agreement.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Instead of following the proper ways to worship me, you have put foreigners in charge of worship at my temple.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">And so I, the Lord God, say that no godless foreigner who disobeys me will be allowed in my temple. This includes any foreigner living in Israel.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Some of the Levites turned their backs on me and joined the other people of Israel in worshiping idols. So these Levites must be punished!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">They will still be allowed to serve me as temple workers by guarding the gates and by killing the animals to be sacrificed and by helping the worshipers.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">But because these Levites served the people of Israel when they worshiped idols, I, the Lord God, promise that the Levites will be punished. They did not stop the Israelites from sinning,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">and now I will no longer let the Levites serve as my priests or come near anything sacred to me. They must suffer shame and disgrace for their disgusting sins.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">They will be responsible for all the hard work that must be done in the temple.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">The priests of the Levi tribe who are descendants of Zadok the priest were faithful to me, even when the rest of the Israelites turned away. And so, these priests will continue to serve as my priests and to offer the fat and the blood of sacrifices.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">They will come into my temple, where they will offer sacrifices at my altar and lead others in worship.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">When they come to the inner courtyard, they must wear their linen priestly clothes. My priests must never wear anything made of wool when they are on duty in this courtyard or in the temple.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Even their turbans and underwear must be made of linen to keep my priests from sweating when they work.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">And before they leave to join the other people in the outer courtyard, they must take off their priestly clothes, then place them in the sacred rooms and put on their regular clothes. That way, no one will touch their sacred clothes and be harmed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Priests must never shave their heads when they are mourning. But they must keep their hair properly trimmed and not let it grow too long.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">They must not drink wine before going to the inner courtyard.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">A priest must not marry a divorced woman; he can marry only a virgin from Israel or the widow of another priest.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">Priests must teach my people the difference between what is sacred and what is ordinary, and between what is clean and what is unclean.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">They will make decisions in difficult legal cases, according to my own laws. They must also observe the religious festivals my Law requires and must always respect the Sabbath.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">Touching a dead body will make a person unclean. So a priest must not go near a dead body, unless it is one of his parents or children, or his brother or unmarried sister.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">If a priest touches a dead body, he is unclean and must go through a ceremony to make himself clean. Then seven days later,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">he must go to the inner courtyard of the temple and offer a sacrifice for sin. After that, he may once again serve as my priest. I, the Lord God, have spoken.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">I myself will provide for my priests, and so they won't receive any land of their own.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">Instead, they will receive part of the grain sacrifices, as well as part of the sacrifices for sin and sacrifices to make things right. They will also be given everything in Israel that has been completely dedicated to me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">The first part of every harvest will belong to the priests. They will also receive part of all special gifts and offerings the Israelites bring to me. And whenever any of my people bake bread, they will give their first loaf as an offering to the priests, and I will bless the homes of the people when they do this.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">Priests must not eat any bird or animal that dies a natural death or that has been killed by a wild animal.</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="45">
			<VERS vnumber="1">When the land of Israel is divided among the twelve tribes, you must set aside an area that will belong to me. This sacred area will be 12.5 kilometers long and 10 kilometers wide.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">The temple will be on a piece of land 255 meters square, and the temple will be completely surrounded by an open space 25 meters wide. This property will belong to every ruler of Israel, so they will always be fair to my people and will let them live peacefully in the land given to their tribes. You leaders of Israel have cheated and abused my people long enough! I want you to stop sinning and start doing what is right and fair. You must never again force my people off their own land. I, the Lord , have spoken.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">I will give the other half of my land to the Levites who work in my temple, and the towns where they will live will be there.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Next to my sacred land will be an area 12.5 kilometers long and 3 kilometers wide. This will belong to the people of Israel and will include the city of Jerusalem.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">The Lord God said:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">So from now on, you must use honest weights and measures.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">The ephah will be the standard dry measure, and the bath will be the standard liquid measure. Their size will be based on the homer , which will equal ten ephahs or ten baths .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">The standard unit of weight will be the shekel . One shekel will equal 20 gerahs , and 60 shekels will equal one mina .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Leaders of Israel, the people must bring you one sixtieth of their grain harvests as offerings to me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">They will also bring one percent of their olive oil. These things will be measured according to the bath , and ten baths is the same as one homer or one cor .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Finally, they must bring one sheep out of every 200 from their flocks. These offerings will be used as grain sacrifices, as well as sacrifices to please me and those to ask my blessing. I, the Lord , will be pleased with these sacrifices and will forgive the sins of my people. On the first day of the first month, a young bull that has nothing wrong with it must be offered as a sacrifice to purify the temple.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">The people of Israel will bring you these offerings.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">But during New Moon Festivals, Sabbath celebrations, and other religious feasts, you leaders will be responsible for providing animals for the sacrifices, as well as the grain and wine. All these will be used for the sacrifices for sin, the grain sacrifices, the sacrifices to please me, and those to ask my blessing. I will be pleased and will forgive the sins of my people.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">The Lord God said:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">The priest will take some blood from this sacrifice and smear it on the doorposts of the temple, as well as on the four corners of the altar and on the doorposts of the gates that lead into the inner courtyard.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">The same ceremony must also be done on the seventh day of the month, so that anyone who sins accidentally or without knowing it will be forgiven, and so that my temple will remain holy.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Beginning on the fourteenth day of the first month, and continuing for seven days, everyone will celebrate Passover and eat bread made without yeast.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">On the first day, the ruler will bring a bull to offer as a sacrifice for his sins and for the sins of the people.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">Each day of the festival he is to bring seven bulls and seven rams as sacrifices to please me, and he must bring a goat as a sacrifice for sin. These animals must have nothing wrong with them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">He will also provide nine kilograms of grain and three liters of olive oil to be offered with each bull and each ram.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">The Festival of Shelters will begin on the fifteenth day of the seventh month and will continue for seven days. On each day of this festival, the ruler will provide the same number of animals that he did each day during Passover, as well as the same amount of grain and olive oil for the sacrifices.</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="46">
			<VERS vnumber="1">The Lord said: The east gate of the inner courtyard must remain closed during the six working days of each week. But on the Sabbath and on the first day of the month, this gate will be opened. If the ruler of Israel gives some of his land to one of his children, it will belong to the ruler's child as part of the family property.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Israel's ruler will go from the outer courtyard into the entrance room of this gate and stand in the doorway while the priest offers sacrifices to ask my blessing and sacrifices to please me. The ruler will bow with his face to the ground to show that he has worshiped me. Then he will leave, and the gate will remain open until evening.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Each Sabbath and on the first day of each month, the people of Israel must also come to the east gate and worship me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">On the Sabbath, the ruler will bring six lambs and one ram to be offered as sacrifices to please me. There must be nothing wrong with any of these animals.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">With the ram, he is to offer nine kilograms of grain, and with each of the lambs, he can offer as much as he wants. He must also offer three liters of olive oil with every nine kilograms of grain.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">The ruler is to bring six lambs, a bull, and a ram to be offered as sacrifices at the New Moon Festival. There must be nothing wrong with any of these animals.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">With the bull and the ram, he is to offer nine kilograms of grain, and with each of the lambs, he can offer as much as he wants. He must also offer three liters of olive oil with every nine kilograms of grain.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">The ruler must come through the entrance room of the east gate and leave the same way.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">When my people come to worship me during any festival, they must always leave by the opposite gate from which they came: Those who come in the north gate must leave by the south gate, and those who come in the south gate must leave by the north gate.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Their ruler will come in at the same time they do and leave at the same time they leave.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">At all other festivals and celebrations, nine kilograms of grain will be offered with a bull, and nine kilograms will be offered with a ram. The worshipers can offer as much grain as they want with each lamb. Three liters of olive oil must be offered with every nine kilograms of grain.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">If the ruler voluntarily offers a sacrifice to please me or to ask my blessing, the east gate of the inner courtyard will be opened for him. He will offer his sacrifices just as he does on each Sabbath; then he will leave, and the gate will be closed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Each morning a year-old lamb that has nothing wrong with it must be offered as a sacrifice to please me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Along with it, two kilograms of fine flour mixed with a liter of olive oil must be offered as a grain sacrifice. This law will never change&amp;ndash;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">the lamb, the flour, and the olive oil will be offered to me every morning for all time.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">The Lord God said:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">But if the ruler gives some of his land to one of his servants, the land will belong to the servant until the Year of Celebration, when it will be returned to the ruler. Only the ruler's children can keep what is given to them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">The ruler must never abuse my people by taking land from them. Any land he gives his children must already belong to him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">The man who was showing me the temple then took me back to the inner courtyard. We walked to the south side of the courtyard and stopped at the door to the sacred rooms that belonged to the priests. He showed me more rooms at the western edge of the courtyard</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">and said, &amp;apos;These are the kitchens where the priests must boil the meat to be offered as sacrifices to make things right and as sacrifices for sin. They will also bake the grain for sacrifices in these kitchens. That way, these sacred offerings won't have to be carried through the outer courtyard, where someone could accidentally touch them and be harmed.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">We went back to the outer courtyard and walked past the four corners.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">At each corner I saw a smaller courtyard, 20 meters long and 15 meters wide.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">Around the inside of these smaller courtyards was a low wall of stones, and against the wall were places to build fires.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">The man said, &amp;apos;These are the kitchens where the temple workers will boil the meat that worshipers offer as sacrifices.&amp;apos;</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="47">
			<VERS vnumber="1">The man took me back to the temple, where I saw a stream flowing from under the entrance. It began in the south part of the temple, where it ran past the altar and continued east through the courtyard. We walked to the riverbank, This water flows eastward to the Jordan River valley and empties into the Dead Sea, where it turns the salt water into fresh water.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">We walked out of the temple area through the north gate and went around to the east gate. I saw the small stream of water flowing east from the south side of the gate.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">The man walked east, then took out his measuring stick and measured 500 meters downstream. He told me to wade through the stream there, and the water came up to my ankles.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Then he measured another 500 meters downstream, and told me to wade through it there. The water came up to my knees. Another 500 meters downstream the water came up to my waist.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Another 500 meters downstream, the stream had become a river that could be crossed only by swimming.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">The man said, &amp;apos;Ezekiel, son of man, pay attention to what you've seen.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">where I saw dozens of trees on each side.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">The man said:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Wherever this water flows, there will be all kinds of animals and fish, because it will bring life and fresh water to the Dead Sea.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">From En-Gedi to Eneglaim, people will fish in the sea and dry their nets along the coast. There will be as many kinds of fish in the Dead Sea as there are in the Mediterranean Sea.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">But the marshes along the shore will remain salty, so that people can use the salt from them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Fruit trees will grow all along this river and produce fresh fruit every month. The leaves will never dry out, because they will always have water from the stream that flows from the temple, and they will be used for healing people.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">The northern border will begin at the Mediterranean Sea, then continue eastward to Hethlon, to Lebo-Hamath, then across to Zedad,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Berothah, and Sibraim, which is on the border between the two kingdoms of Damascus and Hamath. The border will end at Hazer-Hatticon, which is on the border of Hauran.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">So the northern border will run between the Mediterranean Sea and Hazar-Enon, which is on the border between Damascus and Hamath.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">The eastern border will begin on the border between the two kingdoms of Hauran and Damascus. It will run south along the Jordan River, which separates the territories of Gilead and Israel, and it will end at the Dead Sea near the town of Tamar.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">The southern border will begin at Tamar, then run southwest to the springs near Meribath-Kadesh. It will continue along the Egyptian Gorge and will end at the Mediterranean Sea.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">The western border will run north along the Mediterranean Sea to a point just west of Lebo-Hamath.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">That is the land to be divided among the tribes of Israel.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">It will belong to the Israelites and to any foreigners living among them whose children were born in Israel. These foreigners must be treated like any other Israelite citizen, and they will receive</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="8">South of Judah's territory will be a special section of land. Its length will be twelve and a half kilometers, and its width will run from the eastern border of Israel west to the Mediterranean Sea. My temple will be located in this section of land.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">An area in the center of this land will belong to me. It will be twelve and a half kilometers long and ten kilometers wide.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">I, the Lord , will give half of my sacred land to the priests. Their share will be twelve and a half kilometers long and five kilometers wide, and my temple will be right in the middle.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Only priests who are descendants of Zadok will receive a share of this sacred land, because they remained faithful to me when the Levites and the rest of the Israelites started sinning.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">The land belonging to the priests will be the most sacred area and will lie south of the area that belongs to the Levites.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">I will give the other half of my sacred land to the Levites. Their share will also be twelve and a half kilometers long and five kilometers wide,</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="28">Gad's southern border is also the southern border of Israel. It will begin at the town of Tamar, then run southwest to the springs near Meribath-Kadesh. It will continue along the Egyptian Gorge and end at the Mediterranean Sea.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">That's how the land of Israel will be divided among the twelve tribes. I, the Lord God, have spoken.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1">In the third year that Jehoiakim was king of Judah, King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylonia attacked Jerusalem.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">The Lord let Nebuchadnezzar capture Jehoiakim and take away some of the things used in God's temple. And when the king returned to Babylonia, he put these things in the temple of his own god.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">One day the king ordered Ashpenaz, his highest palace official, to choose some young men from the royal family of Judah and from other leading Jewish families.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">The king said, &amp;apos;They must be healthy, handsome, smart, wise, educated, and fit to serve in the royal palace. Teach them how to speak and write our language</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">and give them the same food and wine that I am served. Train them for three years, and then they can become court officials.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Four of the young Jews chosen were Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, all from the tribe of Judah.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">But the king's chief official gave them Babylonian names: Daniel became Belteshazzar, Hananiah became Shadrach, Mishael became Meshach, and Azariah became Abednego.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Daniel made up his mind to eat and drink only what God had approved for his people to eat. And he asked the king's chief official for permission not to eat the food and wine served in the royal palace.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">God had made the official friendly and kind to Daniel.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">But the man still told him, &amp;apos;The king has decided what you must eat and drink. And I am afraid he will kill me, if you eat something else and end up looking worse than the other young men.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">The king's official had put a guard in charge of Daniel and his three friends. So Daniel said to the guard,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">&amp;apos;For the next ten days, let us have only vegetables and water at mealtime.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">When the ten days are up, compare how we look with the other young men, and decide what to do with us.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">The guard agreed to do what Daniel had asked.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Ten days later, Daniel and his friends looked healthier and better than the young men who had been served food from the royal palace.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">After this, the guard let them eat vegetables instead of the rich food and wine.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">God made the four young men smart and wise. They read a lot of books and became well educated. Daniel could also tell the meaning of dreams and visions.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">At the end of the three-year period set by King Nebuchadnezzar, his chief palace official brought all the young men to him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">The king interviewed them and discovered that none of the others were as outstanding as Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah. So they were given positions in the royal court.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">From then on, whenever the king asked for advice, he found their wisdom was ten times better than that of any of his other advisors and magicians.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1">During the second year that Nebuchadnezzar was king, he had such horrible nightmares that he could not sleep.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">So he called in his counselors, advisors, magicians, and wise men,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">and said, &amp;apos;I am disturbed by a dream that I don't understand, and I want you to explain it.&amp;apos; will be praised forever and forever. You are all-powerful, and you know everything. you give rulers their power and take it away, and you are the source of wisdom and knowledge. because even the dark is light to you. who was worshiped by my ancestors. Now I thank you and praise you for making me wise and telling me the king's dream, together with its meaning.&amp;apos; Your Majesty, not even the smartest person in all the world can do what you are demanding.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">They answered in Aramaic, &amp;apos;Your Majesty, we hope you live forever! We are your servants. Please tell us your dream, and we will explain what it means.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">But the king replied, &amp;apos;No! I have made up my mind. If you don't tell me both the dream and its meaning, you will be chopped to pieces and your houses will be torn down.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">However, if you do tell me both the dream and its meaning, you will be greatly rewarded and highly honored. Now tell me the dream and explain what it means.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">&amp;apos;Your Majesty,&amp;apos; they said, &amp;apos;if you will only tell us your dream, we will interpret it for you.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">The king replied, &amp;apos;You're just stalling for time,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">because you know what's going to happen if you don't come up with the answer. You've decided to make up a bunch of lies, hoping I might change my mind. Now tell me the dream, and that will prove that you can interpret it.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">His advisors explained, &amp;apos;Your Majesty, you are demanding the impossible! No king, not even the most famous and powerful, has ever ordered his advisors, magicians, or wise men to do such a thing.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">It can't be done, except by the gods, and they don't live here on earth.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Arioch was the king's official in charge of putting the wise men to death. He was on his way to have it done, when Daniel very wisely went to him</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">and asked, &amp;apos;Why did the king give such cruel orders?&amp;apos; After Arioch explained what had happened,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Daniel rushed off and said to the king, &amp;apos;If you will just give me some time, I'll explain your dream.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Daniel returned home and told his three friends.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Then he said, &amp;apos;Pray that the God who rules from heaven will be merciful and explain this mystery, so that we and the others won't be put to death.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">In a vision one night, Daniel was shown the dream and its meaning. Then he praised the God who rules from heaven:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">&amp;apos;Our God, your name</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">You control human events&amp;ndash;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">&amp;apos;You explain deep mysteries,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">You are the God</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">Daniel went back to Arioch, the official in charge of executing the wise men. Daniel said, &amp;apos;Don't kill those men! Take me to the king, and I will explain the meaning of his dream.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">Arioch rushed Daniel to the king and announced, &amp;apos;Your Majesty, I have found out that one of the men brought here from Judah can explain your dream.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">The king asked Daniel, &amp;apos;Can you tell me my dream and what it means?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">Daniel answered:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">However, you must realize that these mysteries weren't explained to me because I am smarter than everyone else. Instead, it was done so that you would understand what you have seen.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">Your Majesty, what you saw standing in front of you was a huge and terrifying statue, shining brightly.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">Its head was made of gold, its chest and arms were silver, and from its waist down to its knees, it was bronze.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">From there to its ankles it was iron, and its feet were a mixture of iron and clay.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">As you watched, a stone was cut from a mountain&amp;ndash;but not by human hands. The stone struck the feet, completely shattering the iron and clay.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">Then the iron, the clay, the bronze, the silver, and the gold were crushed and blown away without a trace, like husks of wheat at threshing time. But the stone became a tremendous mountain that covered the entire earth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">That was the dream, and now I'll tell you what it means.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">Your Majesty, you are the greatest of kings, and God has highly honored you with power</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">over all humans, animals, and birds. You are the head of gold.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">After you are gone, another kingdom will rule, but it won't be as strong. Then it will be followed by a kingdom of bronze that will rule the whole world.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">Next, a kingdom of iron will come to power, crushing and shattering everything.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43">This kingdom will be the result of a marriage between kingdoms, but it will crumble, just as iron and clay don't stick together.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46">King Nebuchadnezzar bowed low to the ground and worshiped Daniel. Then he gave orders for incense to be burned and a sacrifice of grain to be offered in honor of Daniel.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="47">The king said, &amp;apos;Now I know that your God is above all other gods and kings, because he gave you the power to explain this mystery.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="48">The king then presented Daniel with a lot of gifts; he promoted him to governor of Babylon Province and put him in charge of the other wise men.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="49">At Daniel's request, the king appointed Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego to high positions in Babylon Province, and he let Daniel stay on as a palace official.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="3">
			<VERS vnumber="1">King Nebuchadnezzar ordered a gold statue to be built 27 meters high and nearly 3 meters wide. He had it set up in Dura Valley near the city of Babylon,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">and he commanded his governors, advisors, treasurers, judges, and his other officials to come from everywhere in his kingdom to the dedication of the statue.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">So all of them came and stood in front of it. People of every nation and race, now listen to the king's command! &amp;apos;Yes, Your Majesty,&amp;apos; his officers answered. They came out, Praise their God for sending an angel to rescue his servants! They trusted their God and refused to obey my commands. Yes, they chose to die rather than to worship or serve any god except their own.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Then an official stood up and announced:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Trumpets, flutes, harps, and all other kinds of musical instruments will soon start playing. When you hear the music, you must bow down and worship the statue that King Nebuchadnezzar has set up.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Anyone who refuses will at once be thrown into a flaming furnace.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">As soon as the people heard the music, they bowed down and worshiped the gold statue that the king had set up.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Some Babylonians used this as a chance to accuse the Jews to King Nebuchadnezzar.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">They said, &amp;apos;Your Majesty, we hope you live forever!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">You commanded everyone to bow down and worship the gold statue when the music played.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">And you said that anyone who did not bow down and worship it would be thrown into a flaming furnace.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Sir, you appointed three men to high positions in Babylon Province, but they have disobeyed you. Those Jews, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, refuse to worship your gods and the statue you have set up.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">King Nebuchadnezzar was furious. So he sent for the three young men and said,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">&amp;apos;I hear that you refuse to worship my gods and the gold statue I have set up.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Now I am going to give you one more chance. If you bow down and worship the statue when you hear the music, everything will be all right. But if you don't, you will at once be thrown into a flaming furnace. No god can save you from me.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">The three men replied, &amp;apos;Your Majesty, we don't need to defend ourselves.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">The God we worship can save us from you and your flaming furnace.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">But even if he doesn't, we still won't worship your gods and the gold statue you have set up.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Nebuchadnezzar's face twisted with anger at the three men. And he ordered the furnace to be heated seven times hotter than usual.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Next, he commanded some of his strongest soldiers to tie up the men and throw them into the flaming furnace.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">Suddenly the king jumped up and shouted, &amp;apos;Weren't only three men tied up and thrown into the fire?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">&amp;apos;But I see four men walking around in the fire,&amp;apos; the king replied. &amp;apos;None of them is tied up or harmed, and the fourth one looks like a god.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">Nebuchadnezzar went closer to the flaming furnace and said to the three young men, &amp;apos;You servants of the Most High God, come out at once!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">and the king's high officials, governors, and advisors all crowded around them. The men were not burned, their hair wasn't scorched, and their clothes didn't even smell like smoke.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">King Nebuchadnezzar said:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">And I won't allow people of any nation or race to say anything against their God. Anyone who does will be chopped up and their houses will be torn down, because no other god has such great power to save.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">After this happened, the king appointed Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego to even higher positions in Babylon Province.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="4">
			<VERS vnumber="1">King Nebuchadnezzar sent the following letter to the people of all nations and races on the earth: Greetings to all of you! the wonderful miracles God Most High has done for me. and marvelous. He will rule forever, and his kingdom will never end. a very tall tree in the center of the world. until it reached to heaven and could be seen from anywhere on earth. and heavy with fruit&amp;ndash; enough for all nations. Wild animals enjoyed its shade, birds nested in its branches, and all creatures on earth lived on its fruit. &amp;quot;Chop down the tree and cut off its branches; strip off its leaves and scatter its fruit. Make the animals leave its shade and send the birds flying from its branches. in the ground, surrounded by grass and held by chains of iron and bronze. &amp;quot;Make sure that this ruler lives like the animals out in the open fields, unprotected from the dew. of a wild animal at the command It will show to all who live that God Most High controls all kingdoms and chooses for their rulers persons of humble birth.&amp;quot; Daniel replied: Your Majesty, I wish the dream had been against your enemies. King Nebuchadnezzar, this kingdom is no longer yours. &amp;apos;I praise and honor God Most High. God lives forever, and his kingdom will never end. are far less than nothing; God controls the stars in the sky and everyone on this earth. When God does something, we cannot change it or even ask why.&amp;apos; &amp;apos;Praise and honor the King who rules from heaven! Everything he does is honest and fair, and he can shatter the power of those who are proud.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">I am glad to tell about</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">His miracles are mighty</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">I was enjoying a time of peace and prosperity,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">when suddenly I had some horrifying dreams and visions.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Then I commanded every wise man in Babylonia to appear in my court, so they could explain the meaning of my dream.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">After they arrived, I told them my dream, but they were not able to say what it meant.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Finally, a young man named Daniel came in, and I told him the dream. The holy gods had given him special powers, and I had renamed him Belteshazzar after my own god.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">I said, &amp;apos;Belteshazzar, not only are you the wisest of all advisors and counselors, but the holy gods have given you special powers to solve the most difficult mysteries. So listen to what I dreamed and tell me what it means:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">In my sleep I saw</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">It grew stronger and higher,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">It was covered with leaves</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">&amp;apos;While I was in bed, having this vision, a holy angel came down from heaven</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">and shouted:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">But leave its stump and roots</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Give him the mind for seven long years. of the holy angels.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">This punishment is given</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">&amp;apos;Daniel, that was the dream that none of the wise men in my kingdom were able to understand. But I am sure that you will understand what it means, because the holy gods have given you some special powers.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">For a while, Daniel was terribly confused and worried by what he was thinking. But I said, &amp;apos;Don't be bothered either by the dream or by what it means.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">You saw a tree that grew so big and strong that it reached up to heaven and could be seen from anywhere on earth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Its leaves were beautiful, and it produced enough fruit for all living creatures; animals lived in its shade, and birds nested in its branches.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Your Majesty, that tree is you. Your glorious reputation has reached heaven, and your kingdom covers the earth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">Then you saw a holy angel come down from heaven and say, &amp;apos;Chop down the tree and destroy it! But leave its stump and roots in the ground, fastened there by a chain of iron and bronze. Let it stay for seven years out in the field with the wild animals, unprotected from the dew.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">Your Majesty, God Most High has sent you this message, and it means</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">that you will be forced to live with the wild animals, far away from humans. You will eat grass like a wild animal and live outdoors for seven years, until you learn that God Most High controls all earthly kingdoms and chooses their rulers.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">But he gave orders not to disturb the stump and roots. This is to show that you will be king once again, after you learn that the God who rules from heaven is in control.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">Your Majesty, please be willing to do what I say. Turn from your sins and start living right; have mercy on those who are mistreated. Then all will go well with you for a long time.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">But before I could finish speaking, a voice from heaven interrupted:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">You will be forced to live with the wild animals, away from people. For seven years you will eat grass, as though you were an ox, until you learn that God Most High is in control of all earthly kingdoms and that he is the one who chooses their rulers.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">This was no sooner said than done&amp;ndash;I was forced to live like a wild animal; I ate grass and was unprotected from the dew. As time went by, my hair grew longer than eagle feathers, and my fingernails looked like the claws of a bird.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">Finally, I prayed to God in heaven, and my mind was healed. Then I said:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">To him the nations</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">At that time my mind was healed, and once again I became the ruler of my glorious kingdom. My advisors and officials returned to me, and I had greater power than ever before.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">That's why I say:</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="5">
			<VERS vnumber="1">One evening, King Belshazzar gave a great banquet for a thousand of his highest officials, and he drank wine with them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">He got drunk and ordered his servants to bring in the gold and silver cups his father Nebuchadnezzar had taken from the temple in Jerusalem. Belshazzar wanted the cups, so that he and all his wives and officials could drink from them. Your Majesty, I hope you live forever! Don't be afraid or look so pale. So you are Daniel, one of the captives my father brought back from Judah! Your Majesty, I will read the writing and tell you what it means. But you may keep your gifts or give them to someone else. Your father had the power of life or death over everyone, and he could honor or ruin anyone he chose.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Suddenly a human hand was seen writing on the plaster wall of the palace. The hand was just behind the lampstand, and the king could see it writing.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">He was so frightened that his face turned pale, his knees started shaking, and his legs became weak.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">The king called in his advisors, who claimed they could talk with the spirits of the dead and understand the meanings found in the stars. He told them, &amp;apos;The man who can read this writing and tell me what it means will become the third most powerful man in my kingdom. He will wear robes of royal purple and a gold chain around his neck.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">All of King Belshazzar's highest officials came in, but not one of them could read the writing or tell what it meant,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">and they were completely puzzled. Now the king was more afraid than ever before, and his face turned white as a ghost.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">When the queen heard the king and his officials talking, she came in and said:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">In your kingdom there is a man who has been given special powers by the holy gods. When your father Nebuchadnezzar was king, this man was known to be as smart, intelligent, and wise as the gods themselves. Your father put him in charge of all who claimed they could talk with the spirits or understand the meanings in the stars or tell about the future.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">He also changed the man's name from Daniel to Belteshazzar. Not only is he wise and intelligent, but he can explain dreams and riddles and solve difficult problems. Send for Daniel, and he will tell you what the writing means.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">When Daniel was brought in, the king said:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">I was told that the gods have given you special powers and that you are intelligent and very wise.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Neither my advisors nor the men who talk with the spirits of the dead could read this writing or tell me what it means.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">But I have been told that you understand everything and that you can solve difficult problems. Now then, if you can read this writing and tell me what it means, you will become the third most powerful man in my kingdom. You will wear royal purple robes and have a gold chain around your neck.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Daniel answered:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Sir, the Most High God made your father a great and powerful man and brought him much honor and glory.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">God did such great things for him that people of all nations and races shook with fear.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">But when he became proud and stubborn, his glorious kingdom was taken from him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">His mind became like that of an animal, and he was forced to stay away from people and live with wild donkeys. Your father ate grass like an ox, and he slept outside where his body was soaked with dew. He was forced to do this until he learned that the Most High God rules all kingdoms on earth and chooses their kings.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">King Belshazzar, you knew all of this, but you still refused to honor the Lord who rules from heaven.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">Instead, you turned against him and ordered the cups from his temple to be brought here, so that you and your wives and officials could drink wine from them. You praised idols made of silver, gold, bronze, iron, wood, and stone, even though they cannot see or hear or think. You refused to worship the God who gives you breath and controls everything you do.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">That's why he sent the hand to write this message on the wall.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">Belshazzar gave a command for Daniel to be made the third most powerful man in his kingdom and to be given a purple robe and a gold chain.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">That same night, the king was killed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">Then Darius the Mede, who was 62 years old, took over his kingdom.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="6">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Darius divided his kingdom into 120 states and placed a governor in charge of each one.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">In order to make sure that his government was run properly, Darius put three other officials in charge of the governors. One of these officials was Daniel.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">And he did his work so much better than the other governors and officials that the king decided to let him govern the whole kingdom. &amp;apos;Your Majesty, we hope you live forever! &amp;apos;Yes, that's the law I made,&amp;apos; the king agreed. &amp;apos;And just like all written laws of the Medes and Persians, it cannot be changed.&amp;apos; &amp;apos;Greetings to all of you! in my kingdom to worship and honor the God of Daniel. He is the living God, the one who lives forever. His power and his kingdom will never end. and sets them free by working great miracles. Daniel's God has rescued him from the power of the lions.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">The other men tried to find something wrong with the way Daniel did his work for the king. But they could not accuse him of anything wrong, because he was honest and faithful and did everything he was supposed to do.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Finally, they said to one another, &amp;apos;We will never be able to bring any charge against Daniel, unless it has to do with his religion.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">They all went to the king and said:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">All of your officials, leaders, advisors, and governors agree that you should make a law forbidding anyone to pray to any god or human except you for the next 30 days. Everyone who disobeys this law must be thrown into a pit of lions.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Order this to be written and then sign it, so it cannot be changed, just as no written law of the Medes and Persians can be changed.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">So King Darius made the law and had it written down.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Daniel heard about the law, but when he returned home, he went upstairs and prayed in front of the window that faced Jerusalem. In the same way that he had always done, he knelt down in prayer three times a day, giving thanks to God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">The men who had spoken to the king watched Daniel and saw him praying to his God for help.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">They went back to the king and said, &amp;apos;Didn't you make a law that forbids anyone to pray to any god or human except you for the next 30 days? And doesn't the law say that everyone who disobeys it will be thrown into a pit of lions?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">The men then told the king, &amp;apos;That Jew named Daniel, who was brought here as a captive, refuses to obey you or the law that you ordered to be written. And he still prays to his god three times a day.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">The king was really upset to hear about this, and for the rest of the day he tried to think how he could save Daniel.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">At sunset the men returned and said, &amp;apos;Your Majesty, remember that no written law of the Medes and Persians can be changed, not even by the king.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">So Darius ordered Daniel to be brought out and thrown into a pit of lions. But he said to Daniel, &amp;apos;You have been faithful to your God, and I pray that he will rescue you.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">A stone was rolled over the pit, and it was sealed. Then Darius and his officials stamped the seal to show that no one should let Daniel out.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">All night long the king could not sleep. He did not eat anything, and he would not let anyone come in to entertain him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">At daybreak the king got up and ran to the pit.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">He was anxious and shouted, &amp;apos;Daniel, you were faithful and served your God. Was he able to save you from the lions?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Daniel answered, &amp;apos;Your Majesty, I hope you live forever!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">My God knew that I was innocent, and he sent an angel to keep the lions from eating me. Your Majesty, I have never done anything to hurt you.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">The king was relieved to hear Daniel's voice, and he gave orders for him to be taken out of the pit. Daniel's faith in his God had kept him from being harmed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">And the king ordered the men who had brought charges against Daniel to be thrown into the pit, together with their wives and children. But before they even reached the bottom, the lions ripped them to pieces.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">King Darius then sent this message to all people of every nation and race in the world:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">I command everyone</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">He rescues people</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">All went well for Daniel while Darius was king, and even when Cyrus the Persian ruled.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="7">
			<VERS vnumber="3">when suddenly four powerful beasts came out of the sea. Each beast was different.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">The first was like a lion with the wings of an eagle. As I watched, its wings were pulled off. Then it was lifted to an upright position and made to stand on two feet, just like a human, and it was given a human mind.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">The second beast looked like a bear standing on its hind legs. It held three ribs in its teeth, and it was told, &amp;apos;Attack! Eat all the flesh you want.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">The third beast was like a leopard&amp;ndash;except that it had four wings and four heads. It was given authority to rule.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">The fourth beast was stronger and more terrifying than the others. Its huge teeth were made of iron, and what it didn't grind with its teeth, it smashed with its feet. It was different from the others, and it had horns on its head&amp;ndash;ten of them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Just as I was thinking about these horns, a smaller horn appeared, and three of the other horns were pulled up by the roots to make room for it. This horn had the eyes of a human and a mouth that spoke with great arrogance.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Thrones were set up</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">and flames were dashing out</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">I watched closely to see what would happen to this smaller horn because of the arrogant things it was saying. Then before my very eyes, the fourth beast was killed and its body destroyed by fire.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">The other three beasts had their authority taken from them, but they were allowed to live a while longer.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">As I continued to watch the vision that night,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">He was crowned king</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Daniel wrote:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">So I asked one of those standing there, and he explained,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">&amp;apos;The four beasts are four earthly kingdoms.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">But God Most High will give his kingdom to his chosen ones, and it will be theirs forever and ever.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">I wanted to know more about the fourth beast, because it was so different and much more terrifying than the others. What was the meaning of its iron teeth and bronze claws and of its feet that smashed what the teeth and claws had not ground and crushed?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">I also wanted to know more about all ten of those horns on its head. I especially wanted to know more about the one that took the place of three of the others&amp;ndash;the horn that had eyes and spoke with arrogance and seemed greater than the others.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">While I was looking, this horn attacked God's chosen ones and was winning the battle.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Then God Most High, the Eternal God, came and judged in favor of his chosen ones, because the time had arrived for them to be given the kingdom.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">Then I was told</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1">Daniel wrote: In the third year of King Belshazzar of Babylonia, I had a second vision</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">in which I was in Susa, the chief city of Babylonia's Elam Province. I was beside the Ulai River,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">when I looked up and saw a ram standing there with two horns on its head&amp;ndash;both of them were long, but the second one was longer than the first.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">The ram went charging toward the west, the north, and the south. No other animals were strong enough to oppose him, and nothing could save them from his power. So he did as he pleased and became even more powerful. I was trying to figure out the meaning of the vision, when someone suddenly appeared there beside me. Listen, and I will tell you what will happen at the end of time, when God has chosen to show his anger.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">I kept on watching and saw a goat come from the west and charge across the entire earth, without even touching the ground. Between his eyes was a powerful horn,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">and with tremendous anger the goat started toward the ram that I had seen beside the river.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">The goat was so fierce that its attack broke both horns of the ram, leaving him powerless. Then the goat trampled on the ram, and no one could do anything to help.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">After this, the goat became even more powerful. But at the peak of his power, his mighty horn was broken, and four other mighty horns took its place&amp;ndash;one pointing to the north and one to the east, one to the south and one to the west.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">A little horn came from one of these, and its power reached to the south, the east, and even to the holy land.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">It became so strong that it attacked the stars in the sky, which were heaven's army. Then it threw some of them down to the earth and trampled on them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Then one of the holy angels asked another, &amp;apos;When will the daily sacrifices be offered again? What about this horrible rebellion? When will the temple and heaven's army no longer be trampled in the dust?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">The other answered, &amp;apos;It will be 2,300 evenings and mornings before the temple is dedicated and in use again.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Daniel wrote:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">And from beside the Ulai River, a voice like that of a human said, &amp;apos;Gabriel, help him understand the vision.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Gabriel came over, and I fell to the ground in fear. Then he said, &amp;apos;You are merely a human, but you need to understand that this vision is about the end of time.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">While he was speaking, I fell facedown in a deep sleep. But he lifted me to my feet</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">and said:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">The two horns of the ram are the kings of Media and Persia,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">the goat is the kingdom of Greece, and the powerful horn between his eyes is the first of its kings.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">After this horn is broken, four other kingdoms will appear, but they won't be as strong.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">When these rulers have become as evil as possible, their power will end, and then a king who is dangerous and cannot be trusted will appear.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">He will gain strength, but not on his own, and he will cause terrible destruction. He will wipe out powerful leaders and God's people as well.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">His deceitful lies will make him so successful, that he will think he is really great. Suddenly he will kill many people, and he will even attack God, the Supreme Ruler. But God will crush him!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">This vision about the evenings and mornings is true, but these things won't happen for a long time, so don't tell it to others.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">After this, I was so worn out and weak that it was several days before I could get out of bed and go about my duties for the king. I was disturbed by this vision that made no sense to me.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="3">Instead, Jonah ran from the Lord . He went to the seaport of Joppa and found a ship that was going to Spain. So he paid his fare, then got on the ship and sailed away to escape.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">But the Lord made a strong wind blow, and such a bad storm came up that the ship was about to be broken to pieces.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">The sailors were frightened, and they all started praying to their gods. They even threw the ship's cargo overboard to make the ship lighter.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">The ship's captain went to him and said, &amp;apos;How can you sleep at a time like this? Get up and pray to your God! Maybe he will have pity on us and keep us from drowning.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Finally, the sailors got together and said, &amp;apos;Let's ask our gods to show us who caused all this trouble.&amp;apos; It turned out to be Jonah.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">They started asking him, &amp;apos;Are you the one who brought all this trouble on us? What business are you in? Where do you come from? What is your country? Who are your people?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Jonah answered, &amp;apos;I'm a Hebrew, and I worship the Lord God of heaven, who made the sea and the dry land.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">When the sailors heard this, they were frightened, because Jonah had already told them he was running from the Lord . Then they said, &amp;apos;Do you know what you have done?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">The storm kept getting worse, until finally the sailors asked him, &amp;apos;What should we do with you to make the sea calm down?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Jonah told them, &amp;apos;Throw me into the sea, and it will calm down. I'm the cause of this terrible storm.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">The sailors tried their best to row to the shore. But they could not do it, and the storm kept getting worse every minute.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">So they prayed to the Lord , &amp;apos;Please don't let us drown for taking this man's life. Don't hold us guilty for killing an innocent man. All of this happened because you wanted it to.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Then they threw Jonah overboard, and the sea calmed down.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">The sailors were so terrified that they offered a sacrifice to the Lord and made all kinds of promises.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">The Lord sent a big fish to swallow Jonah, and Jonah was inside the fish for three days and three nights.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="2">
			<VERS vnumber="1">From inside the fish, Jonah prayed to the Lord his God: I prayed to you, and you listened to me. From deep in the world of the dead, I begged for your help, and you answered my prayer. to the bottom of the sea. The water was churning all around; I was completely covered by your mighty waves. from your sight, never again to see your holy temple. by the swirling waters that surrounded me. Seaweed had wrapped around my head. below the mountains beneath the sea. I knew that forever, I would be a prisoner there. But, you, Lord God, rescued me from that pit. I remembered you&amp;ndash; and in your holy temple you heard my prayer. turn from the God who offers them mercy. I will offer a sacrifice to you, my Lord .

			<VERS vnumber="1">Once again the Lord told Jonah</VERS>

Each of you must wear sackcloth, and you must even put sackcloth on your animals. You must also pray to the Lord God with all your heart and stop being sinful and cruel. Maybe God will change his mind and have mercy on us, so we won't be destroyed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Jonah obeyed the Lord and went to Nineveh. The city was so big that it took three days just to walk through it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">After walking for a day, Jonah warned the people, &amp;apos;Forty days from now, Nineveh will be destroyed!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">They believed God's message and set a time when they would go without eating to show their sorrow. Then everyone in the city, no matter who they were, dressed in sackcloth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">When the king of Nineveh heard what was happening, he also dressed in sackcloth; he left the royal palace and sat in dust.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">When God saw that the people had stopped doing evil things, he had pity and did not destroy them as he had planned.</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="4">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Jonah was really upset and angry.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">So he prayed: Our Lord , I knew from the very beginning that you wouldn't destroy Nineveh. That's why I left my own country and headed for Spain. You are a kind and merciful God, and you are very patient. You always show love, and you don't like to punish anyone. &amp;apos;Yes, I do,&amp;apos; he answered, &amp;apos;and I'm angry enough to die.&amp;apos; You are concerned about a vine that you did not plant or take care of, a vine that grew up in one night and died the next.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Now let me die! I'd be better off dead.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">The Lord replied, &amp;apos;What right do you have to be angry?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Jonah then left through the east gate of the city and made a shelter to protect himself from the sun. He sat under the shelter, waiting to see what would happen to Nineveh.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">The Lord made a vine grow up to shade Jonah's head and protect him from the sun. Jonah was very happy to have the vine,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">but early the next morning the Lord sent a worm to chew on the vine, and the vine dried up.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">During the day the Lord sent a scorching wind, and the sun beat down on Jonah's head, making him feel faint. Jonah was ready to die, and he shouted, &amp;apos;I wish I were dead!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">But the Lord asked, &amp;apos;Jonah, do you have the right to be angry about the vine?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">But the Lord said:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">In that city of Nineveh there are more than 120,000 people who cannot tell right from wrong, and many cattle are also there. Don't you think I should be concerned about that big city?</VERS>

But is it right for you to live in expensive houses, while my temple is a pile of ruins? Just look at what's happening.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">You harvest less than you plant, you never have enough to eat or drink, your clothes don't keep you warm, and your wages are stored in bags full of holes.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="9">You expected much, but received only a little. And when you brought it home, I made that little disappear. Why have I done this? It's because you hurry off to build your own houses, while my temple is still in ruins.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="15">But from now on, things will get better. Before you started laying the foundation for the temple,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">you recalled what life was like in the past. When you wanted 200 kilograms of wheat, there were only 10, and when you wanted 50 jars of wine, there were only 20.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1">I, the Lord All-Powerful, have something else to say to you priests.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">You had better take seriously the need to honor my name. Otherwise, when you give a blessing, I will turn it into a curse. In fact, I have already done this, because you haven't taken to heart your duties as priests.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">I will punish your descendants and rub your faces in the manure from your animal sacrifices, and then be done with you. You did it by saying, &amp;apos;The Lord is pleased with evil and doesn't care about justice.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">I am telling you this, so I can continue to keep my agreement with your ancestor Levi.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">I blessed him with a full life, as I had promised, and he kept his part of the agreement by honoring me and respecting my name.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">He taught the truth and never told lies, and he led a lot of people to turn from sin, because he obeyed me and lived right.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">You priests should be eager to spread knowledge, and everyone should come to you for instruction, because you speak for me, the Lord All-Powerful.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">But you have turned your backs on me. Your teachings have led others to do sinful things, and you have broken the agreement I made with your ancestor Levi.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">So I caused everyone to hate and despise you, because you disobeyed me and failed to treat all people alike.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Don't you know that we all have God as our Father? Didn't the one God create each of us? Then why do you cheat each other by breaking the agreement God made with your ancestors?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">You people in Judah and Jerusalem have been unfaithful to the Lord . You have disgraced the temple that he loves, and you have committed the disgusting sin of marrying the worshipers of other gods.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">I pray that the Lord will no longer let those who are guilty belong to his people, even if they eagerly decide to offer the Lord a gift.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">And what else are you doing? You cry noisily and flood the Lord 's altar with your tears, because he isn't pleased with your offerings and refuses to accept them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">And why isn't God pleased? It's because he knows that each of you men has been unfaithful to the wife you married when you were young. You promised that she would be your partner, but now you have broken that promise.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Didn't God create you and your wife to become like one person? And why did he do this? It was so you would have children, and then lead them to become God's people. Don't ever be unfaithful to your wife.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">The Lord God All-Powerful of Israel hates anyone who is cruel enough to divorce his wife. So take care never to be unfaithful!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">You have worn out the Lord with your words. And yet, you ask, &amp;apos;How did we do that?&amp;apos;</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="3">
			<VERS vnumber="1">I, the Lord All-Powerful, will send my messenger to prepare the way for me. Then suddenly the Lord you are looking for will appear in his temple. The messenger you desire is coming with my promise, and he is on his way. I'm now on my way to judge you. And I will quickly condemn all who practice witchcraft or cheat in marriage or tell lies in court or rob workers of their pay or mistreat widows and orphans or steal the property of foreigners or refuse to respect me. And yet you ask, &amp;apos;How can we return?&amp;apos; You people are precious to me, and when I come to bring justice, I will protect you, just as parents protect an obedient child.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">On the day the Lord comes, he will be like a furnace that purifies silver or like strong soap in a washbasin. No one will be able to stand up to him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">The Lord will purify the descendants of Levi, as though they were gold or silver. Then they will bring the proper offerings to the Lord ,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">and the offerings of the people of Judah and Jerusalem will please him, just as they did in the past.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">The Lord All-Powerful said:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Descendants of Jacob, I am the Lord All-Powerful, and I never change. That's why you haven't been wiped out,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">even though you have ignored and disobeyed my laws ever since the time of your ancestors. But if you return to me, I will return to you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">You people are robbing me, your God. And, here you are, asking, &amp;apos;How are we robbing you?&amp;apos; You are robbing me of the offerings and of the ten percent that belongs to me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">That's why your whole nation is under a curse.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">I am the Lord All-Powerful, and I challenge you to put me to the test. Bring the entire ten percent into the storehouse, so there will be food in my house. Then I will open the windows of heaven and flood you with blessing after blessing.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">I will also stop locusts from destroying your crops and keeping your vineyards from producing.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Everyone of every nation will talk about how I have blessed you and about your wonderful land. I, the Lord All-Powerful, have spoken!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">You have said horrible things about me, and yet you ask, &amp;apos;What have we said?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Here is what you have said: &amp;apos;It's foolish to serve the Lord God All-Powerful. What do we get for obeying God and from going around looking sad?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">See how happy those arrogant people are. Everyone who does wrong is successful, and when they put God to the test, they always get away with it.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">All those who truly respected the Lord and honored his name started discussing these things, and when God saw what was happening, he had their names written as a reminder in his book.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Then the Lord All-Powerful said:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Then everyone will once again see the difference between those who obey me by doing right and those who reject me by doing wrong.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="4">
			<VERS vnumber="1">The day of judgment is certain to come. And it will be like a red-hot furnace with flames that burn up proud and sinful people, as though they were straw. Not a branch or a root will be left. I, the Lord All-Powerful, have spoken!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">But for you that honor my name, victory will shine like the sun with healing in its rays, and you will jump around like calves at play.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">When I come to bring justice, you will trample those who are evil, as though they were ashes under your feet. I, the Lord All-Powerful, have spoken!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Don't ever forget the laws and teachings I gave my servant Moses on Mount Sinai.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">I, the Lord , promise to send the prophet Elijah before that great and terrible day comes.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">He will lead children and parents to love each other more, so that when I come, I won't bring destruction to the land.</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="1">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Jesus Christ came from the family of King David and also from the family of Abraham. And this is a list of his ancestors.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">There were 14 generations from Abraham to David. There were also 14 from David to the exile in Babylonia and 14 more to the birth of the Messiah.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">This is how Jesus Christ was born. A young woman named Mary was engaged to Joseph from King David's family. But before they were married, she learned that she was going to have a baby by God's Holy Spirit.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Joseph was a good man and did not want to embarrass Mary in front of everyone. So he decided to quietly call off the wedding.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">While Joseph was thinking about this, an angel from the Lord appeared to him in a dream. The angel said, &amp;apos;Joseph, the baby that Mary will have is from the Holy Spirit. Go ahead and marry her.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Then after her baby is born, name him Jesus, because he will save his people from their sins.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">So the Lord's promise came true, just as the prophet had said,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">&amp;apos;A virgin will have a baby boy, and he will be called Immanuel,&amp;apos; which means &amp;apos;God is with us.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">After Joseph woke up, he and Mary were soon married, just as the Lord's angel had told him to do.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">But they did not sleep together before her baby was born. Then Joseph named him Jesus.</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="2">
			<VERS vnumber="1">When Jesus was born in the village of Bethlehem in Judea, Herod was king. During this time some wise men from the east came to Jerusalem</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">and said, &amp;apos;Where is the child born to be king of the Jews? We saw his star in the east and have come to worship him.&amp;apos; of Judea, you are very important among the towns of Judea. From your town will come a leader, who will be like a shepherd for my people Israel.&amp;quot; &amp;apos; crying and weeping loudly. Rachel was mourning for her children, and she refused to be comforted, because they were dead.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">When King Herod heard about this, he was worried, and so was everyone else in Jerusalem.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Herod brought together the chief priests and the teachers of the Law of Moses and asked them, &amp;apos;Where will the Messiah be born?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">They told him, &amp;apos;He will be born in Bethlehem, just as the prophet wrote,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">&amp;quot;Bethlehem in the land</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Herod secretly called in the wise men and asked them when they had first seen the star.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">He told them, &amp;apos;Go to Bethlehem and search carefully for the child. As soon as you find him, let me know. I also want to go and worship him.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">The wise men listened to what the king said and then left. And the star they had seen in the east went on ahead of them until it stopped over the place where the child was.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">They were thrilled and excited to see the star.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">When the men went into the house and saw the child with Mary, his mother, they knelt down and worshiped him. They took out their gifts of gold, frankincense, and myrrh and gave them to him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Later they were warned in a dream not to return to Herod, and they went back home by another road.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">After the wise men had gone, an angel from the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream and said, &amp;apos;Get up! Hurry and take the child and his mother to Egypt! Stay there until I tell you to return, because Herod is looking for the child and wants to kill him.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">That night, Joseph got up and took his wife and the child to Egypt,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">where they stayed until Herod died. So the Lord's promise came true, just as the prophet had said, &amp;apos;I called my son out of Egypt.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">When Herod found out that the wise men from the east had tricked him, he was very angry. He gave orders for his men to kill all the boys who lived in or near Bethlehem and were two years old and younger. This was based on what he had learned from the wise men.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">So the Lord's promise came true, just as the prophet Jeremiah had said,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">&amp;apos;In Ramah a voice was heard</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">After King Herod died, an angel from the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph while he was still in Egypt.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">The angel said, &amp;apos;Get up and take the child and his mother back to Israel. The people who wanted to kill him are now dead.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Joseph got up and left with them for Israel.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">But when he heard that Herod's son Archelaus was now ruler of Judea, he was afraid to go there. Then in a dream he was told to go to Galilee,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">and they went to live there in the town of Nazareth. So the Lord's promise came true, just as the prophet had said, &amp;apos;He will be called a Nazarene.&amp;apos;</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="3">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Years later, John the Baptist started preaching in the desert of Judea.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">He said, &amp;apos;Turn back to God! The kingdom of heaven will soon be here.&amp;apos; &amp;apos;In the desert someone is shouting, &amp;quot;Get the road ready for the Lord! Make a straight path for him.&amp;quot; &amp;apos; You bunch of snakes! Who warned you to run from the coming judgment?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">John was the one the prophet Isaiah was talking about, when he said,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">John wore clothes made of camel's hair. He had a leather strap around his waist and ate grasshoppers and wild honey.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">From Jerusalem and all Judea and from the Jordan River Valley crowds of people went to John.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">They told how sorry they were for their sins, and he baptized them in the river.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Many Pharisees and Sadducees also came to be baptized. But John said to them:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Do something to show you have really given up your sins.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">And don't start telling yourselves that you belong to Abraham's family. I tell you that God can turn these stones into children for Abraham.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">An ax is ready to cut the trees down at their roots. Any tree that doesn't produce good fruit will be chopped down and thrown into a fire.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">I baptize you with water so you will give up your sins. But someone more powerful is going to come, and I am not good enough even to carry his sandals. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">His threshing fork is in his hand, and he is ready to separate the wheat from the husks. He will store the wheat in a barn and burn the husks in a fire that never goes out.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Jesus left Galilee and went to the Jordan River to be baptized by John.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">But John kept objecting and said, &amp;apos;I ought to be baptized by you. Why have you come to me?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Jesus answered, &amp;apos;For now this is how it should be, because we must do all God wants us to do.&amp;apos; Then John agreed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">So Jesus was baptized. And as soon as he came out of the water, the sky opened, and he saw the Spirit of God coming down on him like a dove.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Then a voice from heaven said, &amp;apos;This is my own dear Son, and I am pleased with him.&amp;apos;</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="4">
			<VERS vnumber="1">The Holy Spirit led Jesus into the desert, so that the devil could test him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">After Jesus had gone without eating for 40 days and nights, he was very hungry.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Then the devil came to him and said, &amp;apos;If you are God's Son, tell these stones to turn into bread.&amp;apos; &amp;quot;No one can live only on food. People need every word that God has spoken.&amp;quot; &amp;apos; &amp;quot;God will give his angels orders about you. They will catch you in their arms, and you won't hurt your feet on the stones.&amp;quot; &amp;apos; &amp;quot;Worship the Lord your God and serve only him.&amp;quot; &amp;apos; and Naphtali, lands along the road to the sea and across the Jordan. Listen Galilee, land of the Gentiles! live in darkness, they will see a bright light. Although they live in the shadow of death, a light will shine on them.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Jesus answered, &amp;apos;The Scriptures say:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Next, the devil took Jesus into the holy city to the highest part of the temple.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">The devil said, &amp;apos;If you are God's Son, jump off. The Scriptures say:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Jesus answered, &amp;apos;The Scriptures also say, &amp;quot;Don't try to test the Lord your God!&amp;quot; &amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Finally, the devil took Jesus up on a very high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms on earth and their power.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">The devil said to him, &amp;apos;I will give all this to you, if you will bow down and worship me.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Jesus answered, &amp;apos;Go away Satan! The Scriptures say:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Then the devil left Jesus, and angels came to help him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">When Jesus heard that John had been put in prison, he went to Galilee.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">But instead of staying in Nazareth, Jesus moved to Capernaum. This town was beside Lake Galilee in the territory of Zebulun and Naphtali.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">So God's promise came true, just as the prophet Isaiah had said,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">&amp;apos;Listen, lands of Zebulun</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Although your people</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Then Jesus started preaching, &amp;apos;Turn back to God! The kingdom of heaven will soon be here.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">While Jesus was walking along the shore of Lake Galilee, he saw two brothers. One was Simon, also known as Peter, and the other was Andrew. They were fishermen, and they were casting their net into the lake.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Jesus said to them, &amp;apos;Follow me! I will teach you how to bring in people instead of fish.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Right then the two brothers dropped their nets and went with him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Jesus walked on until he saw James and John, the sons of Zebedee. They were in a boat with their father, mending their nets. Jesus asked them to come with him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">At once they left the boat and their father and went with Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">Jesus went all over Galilee, teaching in their synagogues and preaching the good news about God's kingdom. He also healed every kind of disease and sickness.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">News about him spread all over Syria, and people with every kind of sickness or disease were brought to him. Some of them had a lot of demons in them, others were thought to be crazy, and still others could not walk. But Jesus healed them all.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">Large crowds followed Jesus from Galilee and the region around the ten cities known as Decapolis. They also came from Jerusalem, Judea, and from across the Jordan River.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="5">
			<VERS vnumber="1">When Jesus saw the crowds, he went up on the side of a mountain and sat down. Jesus' disciples gathered around him, who depend only on him. They belong to the kingdom who grieve. They will find comfort! who are humble. The earth will belong to them! more than to eat or drink. They will be given what they want! who are merciful. They will be treated with mercy! whose hearts are pure. They will see him! who make peace. They will be called his children! who are treated badly for doing right. They belong to the kingdom</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">and he taught them:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">God blesses those people of heaven! who want to obey him of heaven.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">God blesses those people</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">God blesses those people</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">God blesses those people</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">God blesses those people</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">God blesses those people</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">God blesses those people</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">God blesses those people</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">God will bless you when people insult you, mistreat you, and tell all kinds of evil lies about you because of me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Be happy and excited! You will have a great reward in heaven. People did these same things to the prophets who lived long ago.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">You are the salt for everyone on earth. But if salt no longer tastes like salt, how can it make food salty? All it is good for is to be thrown out and walked on.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">You are the light for the whole world. A city built on top of a hill cannot be hidden,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">and no one lights a lamp and puts it under a clay pot. Instead, it is placed on a lampstand, where it can give light to everyone in the house.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Make your light shine, so others will see the good you do and will praise your Father in heaven.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Don't suppose I came to do away with the Law and the Prophets. I did not come to do away with them, but to give them their full meaning.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Heaven and earth may disappear. But I promise you not even a period or comma will ever disappear from the Law. Everything written in it must happen.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">If you reject even the least important command in the Law and teach others to do the same, you will be the least important person in the kingdom of heaven. But if you obey and teach others its commands, you will have an important place in the kingdom.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">You must obey God's commands better than the Pharisees and the teachers of the Law obey them. If you don't, I promise you will never get into the kingdom of heaven.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">You know our ancestors were told, &amp;apos;Do not murder&amp;apos; and &amp;apos;A murderer must be brought to trial.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">But I promise you if you are angry with someone, you will have to stand trial. If you call someone a fool, you will be taken to court. And if you say that someone is worthless, you will be in danger of the fires of hell.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">So if you are about to place your gift on the altar and remember that someone is angry with you,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">leave your gift there in front of the altar. Make peace with that person, then come back and offer your gift to God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">Before you are dragged into court, make friends with the person who has accused you of doing wrong. If you don't, you will be handed over to the judge and then to the officer who will put you in jail.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">I promise you will not get out until you have paid the last cent you owe.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">You know the commandment which says, &amp;apos;Be faithful in marriage.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">But I tell you if you look at another woman and want her, you are already unfaithful in your thoughts.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">If your right eye causes you to sin, poke it out and throw it away. It is better to lose one part of your body, than for your whole body to end up in hell.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">If your right hand causes you to sin, chop it off and throw it away! It is better to lose one part of your body, than for your whole body to be thrown into hell.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">You have been taught that a man who divorces his wife must write out divorce papers for her.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">But I tell you not to divorce your wife unless she has committed some terrible sexual sin. If you divorce her, you will cause her to be unfaithful, just as any man who marries her is guilty of taking another man's wife.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">You know our ancestors were told, &amp;apos;Don't use the Lord's name to make a promise unless you are going to keep it.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">But I tell you not to swear by anything when you make a promise! Heaven is God's throne, so don't swear by heaven.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">The earth is God's footstool, so don't swear by the earth. Jerusalem is the city of the great king, so don't swear by it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">Don't swear by your own head. You cannot make one hair white or black.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">When you make a promise, say only &amp;apos;Yes&amp;apos; or &amp;apos;No.&amp;apos; Anything else comes from the devil.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">You know you have been taught, &amp;apos;An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">But I tell you not to try to get even with a person who has done something to you. When someone slaps your right cheek, turn and let that person slap your other cheek.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">If someone sues you for your shirt, give up your coat as well.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">If a soldier forces you to carry his pack one kilometer, carry it two kilometers.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">When people ask you for something, give it to them. When they want to borrow money, lend it to them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43">You have heard people say, &amp;apos;Love your neighbors and hate your enemies.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44">But I tell you to love your enemies and pray for anyone who mistreats you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45">Then you will be acting like your Father in heaven. He makes the sun rise on both good and bad people. And he sends rain for the ones who do right and for the ones who do wrong.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46">If you love only those people who love you, will God reward you for this? Even tax collectors love their friends.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="47">If you greet only your friends, what's so great about this? Don't even unbelievers do that?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="48">But you must always act like your Father in heaven.</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="6">
			<VERS vnumber="1">When you do good deeds, don't try to show off. If you do, you won't get a reward from your Father in heaven. Our Father in heaven, help us to honor your name. your kingdom, so that everyone on earth will obey you, as you are obeyed in heaven. as we forgive others.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">When you give to the poor, don't blow a loud horn. That's what show-offs do in the synagogues and on the street corners, because they are always looking for praise. I can assure you that they already have their reward.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="7">When you pray, don't talk on and on as people do who don't know God. They think God likes to hear long prayers.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1">As Jesus came down the mountain, he was followed by large crowds.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Suddenly a man with leprosy came and knelt in front of Jesus. He said, &amp;apos;Lord, you have the power to make me well, if only you wanted to.&amp;apos; Right then his servant was healed. &amp;apos;He healed our diseases and made us well.&amp;apos; Jesus was sound asleep,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Jesus put his hand on the man and said, &amp;apos;I want to! Now you are well.&amp;apos; At once the man's leprosy disappeared.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Jesus told him, &amp;apos;Don't tell anyone about this, but go and show the priest that you are well. Then take a gift to the temple just as Moses commanded, and everyone will know that you have been healed.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">When Jesus was going into the town of Capernaum, an army officer came up to him and said,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">&amp;apos;Lord, my servant is at home in such terrible pain that he can't even move.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">&amp;apos;I will go and heal him,&amp;apos; Jesus replied.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">But the officer said, &amp;apos;Lord, I'm not good enough for you to come into my house. Just give the order, and my servant will get well.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">I have officers who give orders to me, and I have soldiers who take orders from me. I can say to one of them, &amp;quot;Go!&amp;quot; and he goes. I can say to another, &amp;quot;Come!&amp;quot; and he comes. I can say to my servant, &amp;quot;Do this!&amp;quot; and he will do it.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">When Jesus heard this, he was so surprised that he turned and said to the crowd following him, &amp;apos;I tell you in all of Israel I've never found anyone with this much faith!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Many people will come from everywhere to enjoy the feast in the kingdom of heaven with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">But the ones who should have been in the kingdom will be thrown out into the dark. They will cry and grit their teeth in pain.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Then Jesus said to the officer, &amp;apos;You may go home now. Your faith has made it happen.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Jesus went to the home of Peter, where he found that Peter's mother-in-law was sick in bed with fever.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">He took her by the hand, and the fever left her. Then she got up and served Jesus a meal.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">That evening many people with demons in them were brought to Jesus. And with only a word he forced out the evil spirits and healed everyone who was sick.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">So God's promise came true, just as the prophet Isaiah had said,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">When Jesus saw the crowd, he went across Lake Galilee.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">A teacher of the Law of Moses came up to him and said, &amp;apos;Teacher, I'll go anywhere with you!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Jesus replied, &amp;apos;Foxes have dens, and birds have nests. But the Son of Man doesn't have a place to call his own.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Another disciple said to Jesus, &amp;apos;Lord, let me wait till I bury my father.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Jesus answered, &amp;apos;Follow me, and let the dead bury their dead.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">After Jesus left in a boat with his disciples,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">a terrible storm suddenly struck the lake, and waves started splashing into their boat.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">so the disciples went over to him and woke him up. They said, &amp;apos;Lord, wake up! Save us before we drown!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">But Jesus replied, &amp;apos;Why are you so afraid? You surely don't have much faith.&amp;apos; Then he got up and ordered the wind and the waves to calm down. And everything was calm.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">The men in the boat were amazed and said, &amp;apos;Who is this? Even the wind and the waves obey him.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">After Jesus had crossed the lake, he came to shore near the town of Gadara and started down the road. Two men with demons in them came to him from the tombs. They were so fierce that no one could travel that way.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">Suddenly they shouted, &amp;apos;Jesus, Son of God, what do you want with us? Have you come to punish us before our time?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">Not far from there a large herd of pigs was feeding.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">So the demons begged Jesus, &amp;apos;If you force us out, please send us into those pigs!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">Jesus told them to go, and they went out of the men and into the pigs. All at once the pigs rushed down the steep bank into the lake and drowned.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">The people taking care of the pigs ran to the town and told everything, especially what had happened to the two men.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">Everyone in town came out to meet Jesus. When they saw him, they begged him to leave their part of the country.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="9">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Jesus got into a boat and crossed back over to the town where he lived.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Some people soon brought to him a man lying on a mat because he could not walk. When Jesus saw how much faith they had, he said to the man, &amp;apos;My friend, don't worry! Your sins are forgiven.&amp;apos; The friends of a bridegroom aren't sad while he is still with them. But the time will come when he will be taken from them. Then they will go without eating. &amp;apos;Yes, Lord,&amp;apos; they answered.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Some teachers of the Law of Moses said to themselves, &amp;apos;Jesus must think he is God!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">But Jesus knew what was in their minds, and he said, &amp;apos;Why are you thinking such evil things?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Is it easier for me to tell this man his sins are forgiven or to tell him to get up and walk?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">But I will show you that the Son of Man has the right to forgive sins here on earth.&amp;apos; So Jesus said to the man, &amp;apos;Get up! Pick up your mat and go on home.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">The man got up and went home.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">When the crowds saw this, they were afraid and praised God for giving such authority to people.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">As Jesus was leaving, he saw a tax collector named Matthew sitting at the place for paying taxes. Jesus said to him, &amp;apos;Follow me.&amp;apos; Matthew got up and went with him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Later, Jesus and his disciples were having dinner at Matthew's house. Many tax collectors and other sinners were also there.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Some Pharisees asked Jesus' disciples, &amp;apos;Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and other sinners?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Jesus heard them and answered, &amp;apos;Healthy people don't need a doctor, but sick people do.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Go and learn what the Scriptures mean when they say, &amp;quot;Instead of offering sacrifices to me, I want you to be merciful to others.&amp;quot; I didn't come to invite good people to be my followers. I came to invite sinners.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Some followers of John the Baptist came and asked Jesus, &amp;apos;Why do we and the Pharisees often go without eating, while your disciples never do?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Jesus answered:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">No one uses a new piece of cloth to patch old clothes. The patch would shrink and tear a bigger hole.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">No one pours new wine into old wineskins. The wine would swell and burst the old skins. Then the wine would be lost, and the skins would be ruined. New wine must be put into new wineskins. Both the skins and the wine will then be safe.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">While Jesus was still speaking, an official came and knelt in front of him. The man said, &amp;apos;My daughter has just now died! Please come and place your hand on her. Then she will live again.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Jesus and his disciples got up and went with the man.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">A woman who had been bleeding for twelve years came up behind Jesus and barely touched his clothes.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">She had said to herself, &amp;apos;If I can just touch his clothes, I will be healed.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Jesus turned. He saw the woman and said, &amp;apos;Don't worry! You are now healed because of your faith.&amp;apos; At that moment she was healed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">When Jesus went into the home of the official and saw the musicians and the crowd of mourners,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">he said, &amp;apos;Get out of here! The little girl isn't dead. She is just asleep.&amp;apos; Everyone started laughing at Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">But after the crowd had been sent out of the house, Jesus went to the girl's bedside. He took her by the hand and helped her up.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">News about this spread all over that part of the country.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">As Jesus was leaving that place, two blind men began following him and shouting, &amp;apos;Son of David, have pity on us!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">After Jesus had gone indoors, the two blind men came up to him. He asked them, &amp;apos;Do you believe I can make you well?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">Jesus touched their eyes and said, &amp;apos;Because of your faith, you will be healed.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">They were able to see, and Jesus strictly warned them not to tell anyone about him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">But they left and talked about him to everyone in that part of the country.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">As Jesus and his disciples were on their way, some people brought to him a man who could not talk because a demon was in him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">After Jesus had forced the demon out, the man started talking. The crowds were so amazed they began saying, &amp;apos;Nothing like this has ever happened in Israel!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">But the Pharisees said, &amp;apos;The leader of the demons gives him the power to force out demons.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">Jesus went to every town and village. He taught in their synagogues and preached the good news about God's kingdom. Jesus also healed every kind of disease and sickness.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">When he saw the crowds, he felt sorry for them. They were confused and helpless, like sheep without a shepherd.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">He said to his disciples, &amp;apos;A large crop is in the fields, but there are only a few workers.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">Ask the Lord in charge of the harvest to send out workers to bring it in.&amp;apos;</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="10">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Jesus called together his twelve disciples. He gave them the power to force out evil spirits and to heal every kind of disease and sickness.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">The first of the twelve apostles was Simon, better known as Peter. His brother Andrew was an apostle, and so were James and John, the two sons of Zebedee.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Philip, Bartholomew, Thomas, Matthew the tax collector, James the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus were also apostles.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">The others were Simon, known as the Eager One, and Judas Iscariot, who later betrayed Jesus. Stay away from the Gentiles and don't go to any Samaritan town. Workers deserve their food.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Jesus sent out the twelve apostles with these instructions:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Go only to the people of Israel, because they are like a flock of lost sheep.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">As you go, announce that the kingdom of heaven will soon be here.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Heal the sick, raise the dead to life, heal people who have leprosy, and force out demons. You received without paying, now give without being paid.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Don't take along any gold, silver, or copper coins.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">And don't carry a traveling bag or an extra shirt or sandals or a walking stick.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">So when you go to a town or a village, find someone able and willing to have you as their guest and stay with them until you leave.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">When you go to a home, give it your blessing of peace.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">If the home is deserving, let your blessing remain with them. But if the home doesn't accept you, take back your blessing of peace.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">If someone won't welcome you or listen to your message, leave their home or town. And shake the dust from your feet at them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">I promise you the day of judgment will be easier for the towns of Sodom and Gomorrah than for that town.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">I am sending you like lambs into a pack of wolves. So be as wise as snakes and as innocent as doves.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Watch out for people who will take you to court and have you beaten in their synagogues.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Because of me, you will be dragged before rulers and kings to tell them and the Gentiles about your faith.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">But when someone arrests you, don't worry about what you will say or how you will say it. At that time you will be given the words to say.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">But you will not really be the one speaking. The Spirit from your Father will tell you what to say.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Brothers and sisters will betray one another and have each other put to death. Parents will betray their own children, and children will turn against their parents and have them killed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Everyone will hate you because of me. But if you remain faithful until the end, you will be saved.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">When people mistreat you in one town, hurry to another one. I promise you before you have gone to all the towns of Israel, the Son of Man will come.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">Students are not better than their teacher, and slaves are not better than their master.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">It is enough for students to be like their teacher and for slaves to be like their master. If people call the head of the family Satan, what will they say about the rest of the family?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">Don't be afraid of anyone! Everything that is hidden will be found out, and every secret will be known.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">Whatever I say to you in the dark, you must tell in the light. And you must announce from the housetops whatever I have whispered to you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">Don't be afraid of people. They can kill you, but they cannot harm your soul. Instead, you should fear God who can destroy both your body and your soul in hell.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">Aren't two sparrows sold for only a penny? But your Father knows when any one of them falls to the ground.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">Even the hairs on your head are counted.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">So don't be afraid! You are worth much more than many sparrows.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">If you tell others you belong to me, I will tell my Father in heaven you are my followers.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">But if you reject me, I will tell my Father in heaven you don't belong to me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">Don't think I came to bring peace to the earth! I came to bring trouble, not peace.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">I came to turn sons against their fathers, daughters against their mothers, and daughters-in-law against their mothers-in-law.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">Your worst enemies will be in your own family.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">If you love your father or mother or even your sons and daughters more than me, you are not fit to be my disciples.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">And unless you are willing to take up your cross and follow me, you are not fit to be my disciples.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">If you try to save your life, you will lose it. But if you give it up for me, you will surely find it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">Anyone who welcomes you welcomes me. And anyone who welcomes me also welcomes the one who sent me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">Anyone who welcomes a prophet, just because that person is a prophet, will be given the same reward as a prophet. Anyone who welcomes a good person, just because that person is good, will be given the same reward as a good person.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">And anyone who gives one of my most humble followers a cup of cool water, just because that person is my follower, will be rewarded.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1">After Jesus had finished instructing his twelve disciples, he left and began teaching and preaching in the towns. What sort of person did you go out into the desert to see? Was he like tall grass blown about by the wind? but you would not dance! We sang a funeral song, but you would not mourn!&amp;apos; My Father, Lord of heaven and earth, I am grateful that you hid all this from wise and educated people and showed it to ordinary people.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">John was in prison when he heard what Christ was doing. So John sent some of his followers</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">to ask Jesus, &amp;apos;Are you the one we should be looking for? Or must we wait for someone else?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Jesus answered, &amp;apos;Go and tell John what you have heard and seen.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">The blind are now able to see, and the lame can walk. People with leprosy are being healed, and the deaf can hear. The dead are raised to life, and the poor are hearing the good news.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="7">As John's followers were going away, Jesus spoke to the crowds about John:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">What kind of man did you go out to see? Was he someone dressed in fine clothes? People who dress like that live in the king's palace.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">What did you really go out to see? Was he a prophet? He certainly was. I tell you that he was more than a prophet.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">In the Scriptures God says about him, &amp;apos;I am sending my messenger ahead to get things ready for you.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">I tell you no one ever born on this earth is greater than John the Baptist. But whoever is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than John.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">From the time of John the Baptist until now, violent people have been trying to take over the kingdom of heaven by force.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">All the Books of the Prophets and the Law of Moses told what was going to happen up to the time of John.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">And if you believe them, John is Elijah, the prophet you are waiting for.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">If you have ears, pay attention!</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="19">But the Son of Man goes around eating and drinking, and you say, &amp;apos;That man eats and drinks too much! He is even a friend of tax collectors and sinners.&amp;apos; Yet Wisdom is shown to be right by what it does.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">In the towns where Jesus had worked most of his miracles, the people refused to turn to God. So Jesus was upset with them and said:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">You people of Chorazin are in for trouble! You people of Bethsaida are in for trouble too! If the miracles that took place here had happened in Tyre and Sidon, the people there would have turned to God long ago. They would have dressed in sackcloth and put ashes on their heads.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="23">People of Capernaum, do you think you will be honored in heaven? You will go down to hell! If the miracles that took place in your town had happened in Sodom, it would still be standing.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">So I tell you on the day of judgment the people of Sodom will get off easier than you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">At that moment Jesus said:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">Yes, Father, this is what pleased you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">My Father has given me everything, and he is the only one who knows the Son. The only one who truly knows the Father is the Son. But the Son wants to tell others about the Father, so they can know him too.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1">One Sabbath, Jesus and his disciples were walking through some wheat fields. His disciples were hungry and began picking and eating grains of wheat.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Some Pharisees noticed this and said to Jesus, &amp;apos;Why are your disciples picking grain on the Sabbath? They are not supposed to do this!&amp;apos; You surely must have read what David did when he and his followers were hungry. I love him, and he pleases me. I will give him my Spirit, and he will bring justice to the nations. or call out in the streets. or put out a dying flame, but he will make sure that justice is done. their hope in him.&amp;apos; Any kingdom where people fight each other will end up ruined. And a town or family that fights will soon destroy itself. You want a sign because you are evil and won't believe! But the only sign you will get is the sign of the prophet Jonah.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Jesus answered:</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="10">where there was a man whose hand was paralyzed. Some Pharisees wanted to accuse Jesus of doing something wrong, so they asked him, &amp;apos;Is it right to heal someone on the Sabbath?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Jesus answered, &amp;apos;If one of your sheep fell into a ditch on the Sabbath, wouldn't you lift it out?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">People are worth much more than sheep, and so it is right to do good on the Sabbath.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Then Jesus told the man, &amp;apos;Hold out your hand.&amp;apos; The man did, and it became as healthy as the other one.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">The Pharisees left and started making plans to kill Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">When Jesus found out what was happening, he left there and large crowds followed him. He healed all of their sick,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">but warned them not to tell anyone about him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">So God's promise came true, just as Isaiah the prophet had said,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">&amp;apos;Here is my chosen servant!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">He won't shout or yell</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">He won't break off a bent reed</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">All nations will place</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Some people brought to Jesus a man who was blind and could not talk because he had a demon in him. Jesus healed the man, and then he was able to talk and see.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">The crowds were so amazed they asked, &amp;apos;Could Jesus be the Son of David?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">When the Pharisees heard this, they said, &amp;apos;He forces out demons by the power of Beelzebul, the ruler of the demons!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">Jesus knew what they were thinking, so he said to them:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">So if Satan fights against himself, how can his kingdom last?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">If I use the power of Beelzebul to force out demons, whose power do your own followers use to force them out? Your followers are the ones who will judge you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">But when I force out demons by the power of God's Spirit, it proves that God's kingdom has already come to you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">How can anyone break into a strong man's house and steal his things, unless he first ties up the strong man? Then he can take everything.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">If you are not on my side, you are against me. If you don't gather in the harvest with me, you scatter it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">A good tree produces good fruit, and a bad tree produces bad fruit. You can tell what a tree is like by the fruit it produces.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">You are a bunch of evil snakes, so how can you say anything good? Your words show what is in your hearts.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">Good people bring good things out of their hearts, but evil people bring evil things out of their hearts.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">I promise you on the day of judgment, everyone will have to account for every careless word they have spoken.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">On that day they will be told they are either innocent or guilty because of the things they have said.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">Some Pharisees and teachers of the Law of Moses said, &amp;apos;Teacher, we want you to show us a sign from heaven.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">But Jesus replied:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">He was in the stomach of a big fish for three days and nights, just as the Son of Man will be deep in the earth for three days and nights.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">On the day of judgment the people of Nineveh will stand there with you and condemn you. They turned to God when Jonah preached, and yet here is something far greater than Jonah.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">The Queen of the South will also stand there with you and condemn you. She traveled a long way to hear Solomon's wisdom, and yet here is something much greater than Solomon.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43">When an evil spirit leaves a person, it travels through the desert, looking for a place to rest. But when the demon doesn't find a place,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44">it says, &amp;apos;I will go back to the home I left.&amp;apos; When it gets there and finds the place empty, clean, and neat,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45">it goes off and finds seven other evil spirits even worse than itself. They all come and make their home there, and the person ends up in worse shape than before. That's how it will be with you evil people of today.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46">While Jesus was still speaking to the crowds, his mother and brothers came and stood outside because they wanted to talk with him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="47">Someone told Jesus, &amp;apos;Your mother and brothers are standing outside and want to talk with you.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="48">Jesus answered, &amp;apos;Who is my mother and who are my brothers?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="49">Then he pointed to his disciples and said, &amp;apos;These are my mother and my brothers!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="50">Anyone who obeys my Father in heaven is my brother or sister or mother.&amp;apos;</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="13">
			<VERS vnumber="1">That same day Jesus left the house and went out beside Lake Galilee, where he sat down to teach.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Such large crowds gathered around him that he had to sit in a boat, while the people stood on the shore.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Then he taught them many things by using stories. He said: A farmer went out to scatter seed in a field. I have explained the secrets about the kingdom of heaven to you, but not to others. &amp;apos;These people will listen and listen, but never understand. They will look and look, but never see. stubborn minds! They refuse to listen; they cover their eyes. They cannot see or hear or understand. If they could, they would turn to me, and I would heal them.&amp;apos; The kingdom of heaven is like what happened when a farmer scattered good seed in a field. His servants then asked, &amp;apos;Do you want us to go out and pull up the weeds?&amp;apos; The kingdom of heaven is like what happens when a farmer plants a mustard seed in a field. The kingdom of heaven is like what happens when a woman mixes a little yeast into three big batches of flour. Finally, all the dough rises. &amp;apos;I will use stories to speak my message and to explain things hidden since the creation of the world.&amp;apos; The one who scattered the good seed is the Son of Man. But Jesus said, &amp;apos;Prophets are honored by everyone, except the people of their hometown and their own family.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">While the farmer was scattering the seed, some of it fell along the road and was eaten by birds.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Other seeds fell on thin, rocky ground and quickly started growing because the soil wasn't very deep.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">But when the sun came up, the plants were scorched and dried up, because they did not have deep roots.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Some other seeds fell where thornbushes grew up and choked the plants.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">But a few seeds did fall on good ground where the plants produced 100 or 60 or 30 times as much as was scattered.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">If you have ears, pay attention!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Jesus' disciples came to him and asked, &amp;apos;Why do you use stories to speak to the people?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Jesus answered:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Everyone who has something will be given more. But people who don't have anything will lose even what little they have.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">I use stories when I speak to them because when they look, they cannot see, and when they listen, they cannot hear or understand.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">So God's promise came true, just as the prophet Isaiah had said,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">All of them have</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">But God has blessed you, because your eyes can see and your ears can hear!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Many prophets and good people were eager to see what you see and to hear what you hear. But I tell you they did not see or hear.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Now listen to the meaning of the story about the farmer:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">The seeds that fell along the road are the people who hear the message about the kingdom, but don't understand it. Then the evil one comes and snatches the message from their hearts.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">The seeds that fell on rocky ground are the people who gladly hear the message and accept it at once.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">But they don't have deep roots, and they don't last very long. As soon as life gets hard or the message gets them in trouble, they give up.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">The seeds that fell among the thornbushes are also people who hear the message. But they start worrying about the needs of this life and are fooled by the desire to get rich. So the message gets choked out, and they never produce anything.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">The seeds that fell on good ground are the people who hear and understand the message. They produce as much as 100 or 60 or 30 times what was planted.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">Jesus then told them this story:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">But while everyone was sleeping, an enemy came and scattered weed seeds in the field and then left.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">When the plants came up and began to mature, the farmer's servants could see the weeds.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">The servants came and asked, &amp;apos;Sir, didn't you scatter good seed in your field? Where did these weeds come from?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">&amp;apos;An enemy did this,&amp;apos; he replied.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">&amp;apos;No!&amp;apos; he answered. &amp;apos;You might also pull up the wheat.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">Leave the weeds alone until harvest time. Then I'll tell my workers to gather the weeds and tie them up and burn them. But I'll order them to store the wheat in my barn.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">Jesus told them another story:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">Although it is the smallest of all seeds, it grows larger than any garden plant and becomes a tree. Birds even come and nest on its branches.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">Jesus also said:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">Jesus used stories when he spoke to the people. In fact, he did not tell them anything without using stories.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">So God's promise came true, just as the prophet had said,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">After Jesus left the crowd and went inside, his disciples came to him and said, &amp;apos;Explain to us the story about the weeds in the wheat field.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">Jesus answered:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">The field is the world, and the good seeds are the people who belong to the kingdom. The weeds are those who belong to the evil one,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">and the one who scattered them is the devil. The harvest is the end of time, and angels are the ones who bring in the harvest.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">Weeds are gathered and burned. That's how it will be at the end of time.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">The Son of Man will send out his angels, and they will gather from his kingdom everyone who does wrong or causes others to sin.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">Then he will throw them into a flaming furnace, where people will cry and grit their teeth in pain.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43">But everyone who has done right will shine like the sun in their Father's kingdom. If you have ears, pay attention!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44">The kingdom of heaven is like what happens when someone finds a treasure hidden in a field and buries it again. Such a person is happy and goes and sells everything in order to buy that field.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45">The kingdom of heaven is like what happens when a shop owner is looking for fine pearls.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46">After finding a very valuable one, the owner goes and sells everything in order to buy that pearl.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="47">The kingdom of heaven is like what happens when a net is thrown into a lake and catches all kinds of fish.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="48">When the net is full, it is dragged to the shore, and the fishermen sit down to separate the fish. They keep the good ones, but throw the bad ones away.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="49">That's how it will be at the end of time. Angels will come and separate the evil people from the ones who have done right.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="50">Then those evil people will be thrown into a flaming furnace, where they will cry and grit their teeth in pain.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="51">Jesus asked his disciples if they understood all these things. They said, &amp;apos;Yes, we do.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="52">So he told them, &amp;apos;Every student of the Scriptures who becomes a disciple in the kingdom of heaven is like someone who brings out new and old treasures from the storeroom.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="53">When Jesus had finished telling these stories, he left</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="54">and went to his hometown. He taught in their synagogue, and the people were so amazed that they asked, &amp;apos;Where does he get all this wisdom and the power to work these miracles?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="55">Isn't he the son of the carpenter? Isn't Mary his mother, and aren't James, Joseph, Simon, and Judas his brothers?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="56">Don't his sisters still live here in our town? How can he do all this?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="57">So the people were upset because of what he was doing.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="58">And because the people did not have any faith, Jesus did not work many miracles there.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="14">
			<VERS vnumber="1">About this time Herod the ruler heard the news about Jesus</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">and told his officials, &amp;apos;This is John the Baptist! He has come back from death, and that's why he has the power to work these miracles.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Herod wanted to kill John. But the people thought John was a prophet, and Herod was afraid of what they might do.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">When Herod's birthday came, the daughter of Herodias danced for the guests. She pleased Herod</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">so much he swore to give her whatever she wanted.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">But the girl's mother told her to say, &amp;apos;Here on a serving plate I want the head of John the Baptist!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Herod was sorry for what he had said. But he did not want to break the promise he had made in front of his guests. So he ordered a guard</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">to go to the prison and cut off John's head.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">It was taken on a serving plate to the girl, and she gave it to her mother.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">John's followers took his body and buried it. Then they told Jesus what had happened.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">After Jesus heard about John, he crossed Lake Galilee to go to some place where he could be alone. But the crowds found out and followed him on foot from the towns.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">When Jesus got out of the boat, he saw the large crowd. He felt sorry for them and healed everyone who was sick.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">That evening the disciples came to Jesus and said, &amp;apos;This place is like a desert, and it's already late. Let the crowds leave, so they can go to the villages and buy some food.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Jesus replied, &amp;apos;They don't have to leave. Why don't you give them something to eat?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">But they said, &amp;apos;We have only five small loaves of bread and two fish.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Jesus asked his disciples to bring the food to him,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">and he told the crowd to sit down on the grass. Jesus took the five loaves and the two fish. He looked up toward heaven and blessed the food. Then he broke the bread and handed it to his disciples, and they gave it to the people.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">After everyone had eaten all they wanted, Jesus' disciples picked up twelve large baskets of leftovers.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">There were about 5,000 men who ate, not counting the women and children.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">At once, Jesus made his disciples get into a boat and start back across the lake. But he stayed until he had sent the crowds away.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">Then he went up on a mountain where he could be alone and pray. Later in the evening, he was still there.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">By this time the boat was a long way from the shore. It was going against the wind and was being tossed around by the waves.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">A little while before morning, Jesus came walking on the water toward his disciples.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">When they saw him, they thought he was a ghost. They were terrified and started screaming.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">At once, Jesus said to them, &amp;apos;Don't worry! I am Jesus. Don't be afraid.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">Peter replied, &amp;apos;Lord, if it really is you, tell me to come to you on the water.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">&amp;apos;Come on!&amp;apos; Jesus said. Peter then got out of the boat and started walking on the water toward him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">But when Peter saw how strong the wind was, he was afraid and started sinking. &amp;apos;Save me, Lord!&amp;apos; he shouted.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">At once, Jesus reached out his hand. He helped Peter up and said, &amp;apos;You surely don't have much faith. Why do you doubt?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">When Jesus and Peter got into the boat, the wind died down.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">The men in the boat worshiped Jesus and said, &amp;apos;You really are the Son of God!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">Jesus and his disciples crossed the lake and came to shore near the town of Gennesaret.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">The people found out he was there, and they sent word to everyone who lived in this part of the country. So they brought all the sick people to Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">They begged him just to let them touch his clothes, and everyone who did was healed.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="15">
			<VERS vnumber="1">About this time some Pharisees and teachers of the Law of Moses came from Jerusalem. They asked Jesus,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">&amp;apos;Why don't your disciples obey what our ancestors taught us to do? They don't even wash their hands before they eat.&amp;apos; Why do you disobey God and follow your own teaching? with your words, but you never really think about me. to worship me, when you teach rules made up by humans.&amp;apos; Don't any of you know by now what I am talking about?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Jesus answered:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Didn't God command you to respect your father and mother? Didn't he tell you to put to death all who curse their parents?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">But you let people get by without helping their parents when they should. You let them say that what they have has been offered to God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Is this any way to show respect to your parents? You ignore God's commands in order to follow your own teaching.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">And you are nothing but show-offs! Isaiah the prophet was right when he wrote that God had said,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">&amp;apos;All of you praise me</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">It is useless for you</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Jesus called the crowd together and said, &amp;apos;Pay attention and try to understand what I mean.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">The food you put into your mouth doesn't make you unclean and unfit to worship God. The bad words that come out of your mouth are what make you unclean.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Then his disciples came over to him and asked, &amp;apos;Do you know you insulted the Pharisees by what you said?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Jesus answered, &amp;apos;Every plant that my Father in heaven did not plant will be pulled up by the roots.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Stay away from those Pharisees! They are like blind people leading other blind people, and all of them will fall into a ditch.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Peter replied, &amp;apos;What did you mean when you talked about the things that make people unclean?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Jesus then said:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Don't you know that the food you put into your mouth goes into your stomach and then out of your body?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">But the words that come out of your mouth come from your heart. And they are what make you unfit to worship God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Out of your heart come evil thoughts, murder, unfaithfulness in marriage, vulgar deeds, stealing, telling lies, and insulting others.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">These are what make you unclean. Eating without washing your hands will not make you unfit to worship God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Jesus left and went to the territory near the towns of Tyre and Sidon.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Suddenly a Canaanite woman from there came out shouting, &amp;apos;Lord and Son of David, have pity on me! My daughter is full of demons.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">Jesus did not say a word. But the woman kept following along and shouting, so his disciples came up and asked him to send her away.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">Jesus said, &amp;apos;I was sent only to the people of Israel! They are like a flock of lost sheep.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">The woman came closer. Then she knelt down and begged, &amp;apos;Please help me, Lord!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">Jesus replied, &amp;apos;It isn't right to take food away from children and feed it to dogs.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">&amp;apos;Lord, this is true,&amp;apos; the woman said, &amp;apos;but even puppies get the crumbs that fall from their owner's table.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">Jesus answered, &amp;apos;Dear woman, you really do have a lot of faith, and you will be given what you want.&amp;apos; At that moment her daughter was healed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">From there, Jesus went along Lake Galilee. Then he climbed a hill and sat down.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">Large crowds came and brought many people who were paralyzed or blind or lame or unable to talk. They placed them, and many others, in front of Jesus, and he healed them all.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">Everyone was amazed at what they saw and heard. People who had never spoken could now speak. The lame were healed, the paralyzed could walk, and the blind were able to see. Everyone was praising the God of Israel.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">Jesus called his disciples together and told them, &amp;apos;I feel sorry for these people. They have been with me for three days, and they don't have anything to eat. I don't want to send them away hungry. They might faint on their way home.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">His disciples said, &amp;apos;This place is like a desert. Where can we find enough food to feed such a crowd?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">Jesus asked them how much food they had. They replied, &amp;apos;Seven small loaves of bread and a few little fish.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">After Jesus had told the people to sit down,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">he took the seven loaves of bread and the fish and gave thanks. He then broke them and handed them to his disciples, who passed them around to the crowds.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">Everyone ate all they wanted, and the leftovers filled seven large baskets.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">There were 4,000 men who ate, not counting the women and children.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">After Jesus had sent the crowds away, he got into a boat and sailed across the lake. He came to shore near the town of Magadan.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="16">
			<VERS vnumber="1">The Pharisees and Sadducees came to Jesus and tried to test him by asking for a sign from heaven.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">He told them: If the sky is red in the evening, you say the weather will be good. Then Jesus left. You surely don't have much faith! Why are you talking about not having any bread? Simon, son of Jonah, you are blessed! You didn't discover this on your own. It was shown to you by my Father in heaven. If any of you want to be my followers, you must forget about yourself. You must take up your cross and follow me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">But if the sky is red and gloomy in the morning, you say it is going to rain. You can tell what the weather will be like by looking at the sky. But you don't understand what is happening now.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">You want a sign because you are evil and won't believe! But the only sign you will be given is what happened to Jonah.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">The disciples had forgotten to bring any bread when they crossed the lake.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Jesus then warned them, &amp;apos;Watch out! Guard against the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">The disciples talked this over and said to each other, &amp;apos;He must be saying this because we didn't bring along any bread.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Jesus knew what they were thinking and said:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Don't you understand? Have you forgotten about the 5,000 people and all those baskets of leftovers from just five loaves of bread?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">And what about the 4,000 people and all those baskets of leftovers from only seven loaves of bread?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Don't you know by now that I am not talking to you about bread? Watch out for the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Finally, the disciples understood that Jesus wasn't talking about the yeast used to make bread, but about the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">When Jesus and his disciples were near the town of Caesarea Philippi, he asked them, &amp;apos;What do people say about the Son of Man?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">The disciples answered, &amp;apos;Some people say you are John the Baptist or maybe Elijah or Jeremiah or some other prophet.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Then Jesus asked, &amp;apos;But who do you say I am?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Simon Peter spoke up, &amp;apos;You are the Messiah, the Son of the living God.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Jesus told him:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">So I will call you Peter, which means &amp;apos;a rock.&amp;apos; On this rock I will build my church, and death itself will not have any power over it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">I will give you the keys to the kingdom of heaven, and God in heaven will allow whatever you allow on earth. But he will not allow anything you don't allow.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Jesus told his disciples not to tell anyone he was the Messiah.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">From then on, Jesus began telling his disciples what would happen to him. He said, &amp;apos;I must go to Jerusalem. There the nation's leaders, the chief priests, and the teachers of the Law of Moses will make me suffer terribly. I will be killed, but three days later I will rise to life.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Peter took Jesus aside and told him to stop talking like that. He said, &amp;apos;God would never let this happen to you, Lord!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">Jesus turned to Peter and said, &amp;apos;Satan, get away from me! You're in my way because you think like everyone else and not like God.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">Then Jesus said to his disciples:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">If you want to save your life, you will destroy it. But if you give up your life for me, you will find it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">What will you gain, if you own the whole world but destroy yourself? What would you give to get back your soul?</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1">Six days later Jesus took Peter and the brothers James and John with him. They went up on a very high mountain where they could be alone.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">There in front of the disciples, Jesus was completely changed. His face was shining like the sun, and his clothes became white as light.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">All at once Moses and Elijah were there talking with Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">So Peter said to him, &amp;apos;Lord, it is good for us to be here! Let us make three shelters, one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">While Peter was still speaking, the shadow of a bright cloud passed over them. From the cloud a voice said, &amp;apos;This is my own dear Son, and I am pleased with him. Listen to what he says!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">When the disciples heard the voice, they were so afraid they fell flat on the ground.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">But Jesus came over and touched them. He said, &amp;apos;Get up and don't be afraid!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">When they opened their eyes, they saw only Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">On their way down from the mountain, Jesus warned his disciples not to tell anyone what they had seen until after the Son of Man had been raised from death.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">The disciples asked Jesus, &amp;apos;Don't the teachers of the Law of Moses say Elijah must come before the Messiah does?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Jesus told them, &amp;apos;Elijah certainly will come and get everything ready.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">In fact, he has already come. But the people did not recognize him and treated him just as they wanted to. They will soon make the Son of Man suffer in the same way.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Then the disciples understood Jesus was talking to them about John the Baptist.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Jesus and his disciples returned to the crowd. A man knelt in front of him</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">and said, &amp;apos;Lord, have pity on my son! He has a bad case of epilepsy and often falls into a fire or into water.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">I brought him to your disciples, but none of them could heal him.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Jesus said, &amp;apos;You people are too stubborn to have any faith! How much longer must I be with you? Why do I have to put up with you? Bring the boy here.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Then Jesus spoke sternly to the demon. It went out of the boy, and right then he was healed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Later the disciples went to Jesus in private and asked him, &amp;apos;Why couldn't we force out the demon?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">While Jesus and his disciples were going from place to place in Galilee, he told them, &amp;apos;The Son of Man will be handed over to people</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">who will kill him. But three days later he will rise to life.&amp;apos; All of this made the disciples very sad.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">When Jesus and the others arrived in Capernaum, the collectors for the temple tax came to Peter and asked, &amp;apos;Does your teacher pay the temple tax?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">&amp;apos;Yes, he does,&amp;apos; Peter answered.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">Peter answered, &amp;apos;From foreigners.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">But we don't want to cause trouble. So go cast a line into the lake and pull out the first fish you hook. Open its mouth, and you will find a coin. Use it to pay your taxes and mine.&amp;apos;</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="18">
			<VERS vnumber="1">About this time the disciples came to Jesus and asked him who would be the greatest in the kingdom of heaven.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Jesus called for a child to come over and stand near him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Then he said: I promise you this. If you don't change and become like a child, you will never get into the kingdom of heaven. One day a king decided to call in his officials and ask them to give an account of what they owed him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">But if you are as humble as this child, you are the greatest in the kingdom of heaven.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">And when you welcome one of these children because of me, you welcome me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">It will be terrible for people who cause even one of my little followers to sin. Those people would be better off thrown into the deepest part of the ocean with a heavy stone tied around their necks!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">The world is in for trouble because of the way it causes people to sin. There will always be something to cause people to sin, but anyone who does this will be in for trouble.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">If your hand or foot causes you to sin, chop it off and throw it away! You would be better off to go into life paralyzed or lame than to have two hands or two feet and be thrown into the fire that never goes out.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">If your eye causes you to sin, poke it out and get rid of it. You would be better off to go into life with only one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into the fires of hell.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Let me ask you this. What would you do if you had 100 sheep and one of them wandered off? Wouldn't you leave the 99 on the hillside and go look for the one that had wandered away?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">I am sure that finding it would make you happier than having the 99 that never wandered off.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">That's how it is with your Father in heaven. He doesn't want any of these little ones to be lost.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">If one of my followers sins against you, go and point out what was wrong. But do it in private, just between the two of you. If that person listens, you have won back a follower.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">But if that one refuses to listen, take along one or two others. The Scriptures teach that every complaint must be proven true by two or more witnesses.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">If the follower refuses to listen to them, report the matter to the church. Anyone who refuses to listen to the church must be treated like an unbeliever or a tax collector.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">I promise you God in heaven will allow whatever you allow on earth, but God will not allow anything you don't allow.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">I promise that when any two of you on earth agree about something you are praying for, my Father in heaven will do it for you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Whenever two or three of you come together in my name, I am there with you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Peter came up to the Lord and asked, &amp;apos;How many times should I forgive someone who does something wrong to me? Is seven times enough?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Jesus answered: Not just 7 times, but 77 times!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">This story will show you what the kingdom of heaven is like:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">As he was doing this, one official was brought in who owed him 50,000,000 silver coins.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">But he didn't have any money to pay what he owed. The king ordered him to be sold, along with his wife and children and all he owned, in order to pay the debt.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">The official got down on his knees and began begging, &amp;apos;Have pity on me, and I will pay you every cent I owe!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">The king felt sorry for him and let him go free. He even told the official that he did not have to pay back the money.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">But as this official was leaving, he happened to meet another official, who owed him 100 silver coins. So he grabbed the man by the throat. He started choking him and said, &amp;apos;Pay me what you owe!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">The man got down on his knees and began begging, &amp;apos;Have pity on me, and I will pay you back.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">But the first official refused to have pity. Instead, he went and had the other official put in jail until he could pay what he owed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">When some other officials found out what had happened, they felt sorry for the man who had been put in jail. Then they told the king what had happened.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">The king called the first official back in and said, &amp;apos;You're an evil man! When you begged for mercy, I said you did not have to pay back a cent.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">Don't you think you should show pity to someone else, as I did to you?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">The king was so angry that he ordered the official to be tortured until he could pay back everything he owed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">That is how my Father in heaven will treat you, if you don't forgive each of my followers with all your heart.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="19">
			<VERS vnumber="1">When Jesus finished teaching, he left Galilee and went to the part of Judea east of the Jordan River.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Large crowds followed him, and he healed their sick. Jesus answered, &amp;apos;Do not murder. Be faithful in marriage. Do not steal. Do not tell lies about others. Yes, all of you have become my followers. And so in the future world, when the Son of Man sits on his glorious throne, I promise you will sit on twelve thrones to judge the twelve tribes of Israel.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Some Pharisees wanted to test Jesus. They came up to him and asked, &amp;apos;Is it right for a man to divorce his wife for just any reason?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Jesus answered, &amp;apos;Don't you know in the beginning the Creator made a man and a woman?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">That's why a man leaves his father and mother and gets married. He becomes like one person with his wife.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Then they are no longer two people, but one. And no one should separate a couple God has joined together.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">The Pharisees asked Jesus, &amp;apos;Why did Moses say a man could write out divorce papers and send his wife away?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Jesus replied, &amp;apos;You are so heartless! That's why Moses allowed you to divorce your wife. But from the beginning God did not intend it to be that way.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">I say if your wife has not committed some terrible sexual sin, you must not divorce her to marry someone else. If you do, you are unfaithful.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">The disciples said, &amp;apos;If that's how it is between a man and a woman, it's better not to get married.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Jesus told them, &amp;apos;Only those people who have been given the gift of staying single can accept this teaching.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Some people are unable to marry because of birth defects or because of what someone has done to their bodies. Others stay single in order to serve God better. Anyone who can accept this teaching should do so.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Some people brought their children to Jesus, so he could place his hands on them and pray for them. His disciples told the people to stop bothering him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">But Jesus said, &amp;apos;Let the children come to me, and don't try to stop them! People who are like these children belong to God's kingdom.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">After Jesus had placed his hands on the children, he left.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">A man came to Jesus and asked, &amp;apos;Teacher, what good thing must I do to have eternal life?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Jesus said to him, &amp;apos;Why do you ask me about what is good? Only God is good. If you want to have eternal life, you must obey his commandments.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">&amp;apos;Which ones?&amp;apos; the man asked.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Respect your father and mother. And love others as much as you love yourself.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">The young man said, &amp;apos;I have obeyed all of these. What else must I do?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Jesus replied, &amp;apos;If you want to be perfect, go sell everything you own! Give the money to the poor, and you will have riches in heaven. Then come and be my follower.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">When the young man heard this, he went away sad, because he was very rich.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">Jesus said to his disciples, &amp;apos;I tell you, it's terribly hard for rich people to get into the kingdom of heaven!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">In fact, it's easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to get into God's kingdom.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">When the disciples heard this, they were greatly surprised and asked, &amp;apos;How can anyone ever be saved?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">Jesus looked straight at them and said, &amp;apos;There are some things people cannot do, but God can do anything.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">Peter replied, &amp;apos;Remember, we have left everything to be your followers! What will we get?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">Jesus answered:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">All who have given up home or brothers and sisters or father and mother or children or land for me will be given 100 times as much. They will also have eternal life.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">But many who are now first will be last, and many who are last will be first.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="20">
			<VERS vnumber="1">As Jesus was telling what the kingdom of heaven would be like, he said: Early one morning a man went out to hire some workers for his vineyard. At noon and again about three in the afternoon he returned to the market. And each time he made the same agreement with others who were loafing around with nothing to do. James and John said, &amp;apos;Yes, we are!&amp;apos; You know foreign rulers like to order their people around. And their great leaders have full power over everyone they rule.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">After he had agreed to pay them the usual amount for a day's work, he sent them off to his vineyard.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">About nine that morning, the man saw some other people standing in the market with nothing to do.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">He promised to pay them what was fair, if they would work in his vineyard.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">So they went.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Finally, about five in the afternoon the man went back and found some others standing there. He asked them, &amp;apos;Why have you been standing here all day long doing nothing?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">&amp;apos;Because no one has hired us,&amp;apos; they answered. Then he told them to go work in his vineyard.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">That evening the owner of the vineyard told the man in charge of the workers to call them in and give them their money. He also told the man to begin with the ones who were hired last.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">When the workers arrived, the ones who had been hired at five in the afternoon were given a full day's pay.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">The workers who had been hired first thought they would be given more than the others. But when they were given the same,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">they began complaining to the owner of the vineyard.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">They said, &amp;apos;The ones who were hired last worked for only one hour. But you paid them the same that you did us. And we worked in the hot sun all day long!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">The owner answered one of them, &amp;apos;Friend, I didn't cheat you. I paid you exactly what we agreed on.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Take your money now and go! What business is it of yours if I want to pay them the same that I paid you?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Don't I have the right to do what I want with my own money? Why should you be jealous, if I want to be generous?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Jesus then said, &amp;apos;So it is. Everyone who is now last will be first, and everyone who is first will be last.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">As Jesus was on his way to Jerusalem, he took his twelve disciples aside and told them in private:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">We are now on our way to Jerusalem, where the Son of Man will be handed over to the chief priests and the teachers of the Law of Moses. They will sentence him to death,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">and then they will hand him over to foreigners who will make fun of him. They will beat him and nail him to a cross. But on the third day he will rise from death.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">The mother of James and John came to Jesus with her two sons. She knelt down and started begging him to do something for her.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Jesus asked her what she wanted, and she said, &amp;apos;When you come into your kingdom, please let one of my sons sit at your right side and the other at your left.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Jesus answered, &amp;apos;Not one of you knows what you are asking. Are you able to drink from the cup that I must soon drink from?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">Jesus replied, &amp;apos;You certainly will drink from my cup! But it isn't for me to say who will sit at my right side and at my left. This is for my Father to say.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">When the ten other disciples heard this, they were angry with the two brothers.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">But Jesus called the disciples together and said:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">But don't act like them. If you want to be great, you must be the servant of all the others.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">And if you want to be first, you must be the slave of the rest.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">The Son of Man did not come to be a slave master, but a slave who will give his life to rescue many people.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">Jesus was followed by a large crowd as he and his disciples were leaving Jericho.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">Two blind men were sitting beside the road. And when they heard that Jesus was coming their way, they shouted, &amp;apos;Lord and Son of David, have pity on us!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">The crowd told them to be quiet, but they shouted even louder, &amp;apos;Lord and Son of David, have pity on us!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">When Jesus heard them, he stopped and asked, &amp;apos;What do you want me to do for you?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">They answered, &amp;apos;Lord, we want to see!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">Jesus felt sorry for them and touched their eyes. At once they could see, and they became his followers.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="21">
			<VERS vnumber="1">When Jesus and his disciples came near Jerusalem, he went to Bethphage on the Mount of Olives and sent two of them on ahead.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">He told them, &amp;apos;Go into the next village, where you will at once find a donkey and her colt. Untie the two donkeys and bring them to me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">If anyone asks why you are doing this, just say, &amp;quot;The Lord needs them.&amp;quot; He will at once let you have the donkeys.&amp;apos; of Jerusalem: &amp;quot;Your king is coming to you! He is humble and rides on a donkey. He comes on the colt of a donkey.&amp;quot; &amp;apos; God bless the one who comes in the name of the Lord. Hooray for God in heaven above!&amp;apos; &amp;apos;Yes, I do!&amp;apos; Jesus answered. &amp;apos;Don't you know that the Scriptures say, &amp;quot;Children and infants will sing praises&amp;quot;?&amp;apos; They thought it over and said to each other, &amp;apos;We can't say God gave John this right. Jesus will ask us why we didn't believe John. Jesus said, &amp;apos;Then I won't tell you who gave me the right to do what I do.&amp;apos; I will tell you a story about a man who had two sons. Then you can tell me what you think. The father went to the older son and said, &amp;apos;Go work in the vineyard today!&amp;apos; &amp;apos;The older one,&amp;apos; the chief priests and leaders answered. Then Jesus told them: A land owner once planted a vineyard. He built a wall around it and dug a pit to crush the grapes in. He also built a lookout tower. Then he rented out his vineyard and left the country. &amp;quot;The stone the builders tossed aside is now the most important stone of all. This is something the Lord has done, and it is amazing to us.&amp;quot;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">So God's promise came true, just as the prophet had said,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">&amp;apos;Announce to the people</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">The disciples left and did what Jesus had told them to do.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">They brought the donkey and its colt and laid some clothes on their backs. Then Jesus got on.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Many people spread clothes in the road, while others put down branches which they had cut from trees.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Some people walked ahead of Jesus and others followed behind. They were all shouting, &amp;apos;Hooray for the Son of David! You can be sure tax collectors and prostitutes will get into the kingdom of God before you ever will!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">When Jesus came to Jerusalem, everyone in the city was excited and asked, &amp;apos;Who can this be?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">The crowds answered, &amp;apos;This is Jesus, the prophet from Nazareth in Galilee.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Jesus went into the temple and chased out everyone who was selling or buying. He turned over the tables of the moneychangers and the benches of the ones who were selling doves.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">He told them, &amp;apos;The Scriptures say, &amp;quot;My house should be called a place of worship.&amp;quot; But you have turned it into a place where robbers hide.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Blind and lame people came to Jesus in the temple, and he healed them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">But the chief priests and the teachers of the Law of Moses were angry when they saw his miracles and heard the children shouting praises to the Son of David.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">The men said to Jesus, &amp;apos;Don't you hear what those children are saying?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Then Jesus left the city and went out to the village of Bethany, where he spent the night.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">When Jesus got up the next morning, he was hungry. He started out for the city,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">and along the way he saw a fig tree. But when he came to it, he found only leaves and no figs. So he told the tree, &amp;apos;You will never again grow any fruit!&amp;apos; Right then the fig tree dried up.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">The disciples were shocked when they saw how quickly the tree had dried up.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">But Jesus said to them, &amp;apos;If you have faith and don't doubt, I promise you can do what I did to this tree. And you will be able to do even more. You can tell this mountain to get up and jump into the sea, and it will.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">If you have faith when you pray, you will be given whatever you ask for.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">Jesus had gone into the temple and was teaching when the chief priests and the leaders of the people came up to him. They asked, &amp;apos;What right do you have to do these things? Who gave you this authority?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">Jesus answered, &amp;apos;I have just one question to ask you. If you answer it, I will tell you where I got the right to do these things.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">Who gave John the right to baptize? Was it God in heaven or merely some human being?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">On the other hand, these people think John was a prophet, and we are afraid of what they might do to us. That's why we can't say it was merely some human who gave John the right to baptize.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">So they told Jesus, &amp;apos;We don't know.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">Jesus said:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">His son told him he would not do it, but later he changed his mind and went.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">The man then told his younger son to go work in the vineyard. The boy said he would, but he didn't go.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">Which one of the sons obeyed his father?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">When John the Baptist showed you how to do right, you would not believe him. But these evil people did believe. And even when you saw what they did, you still would not change your minds and believe.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">Jesus told the chief priests and leaders to listen to this story:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">When it was harvest time, the owner sent some servants to get his share of the grapes.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">But the renters grabbed those servants. They beat up one, killed one, and stoned one of them to death.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">He then sent more servants than he did the first time. But the renters treated them in the same way.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">Finally, the owner sent his own son to the renters, because he thought they would respect him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">But when they saw the man's son, they said, &amp;apos;Someday he will own the vineyard. Let's kill him! Then we can have it all for ourselves.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">So they grabbed him, threw him out of the vineyard, and killed him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">Jesus asked, &amp;apos;When the owner of that vineyard comes, what do you suppose he will do to those renters?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">The chief priests and leaders answered, &amp;apos;He will kill them in some horrible way. Then he will rent out his vineyard to people who will give him his share of grapes at harvest time.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">Jesus replied, &amp;apos;You surely know that the Scriptures say,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43">I tell you God's kingdom will be taken from you and given to people who will do what he demands.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44">Anyone who stumbles over this stone will be crushed, and anyone it falls on will be smashed to pieces.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45">When the chief priests and the Pharisees heard these stories, they knew Jesus was talking about them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46">So they looked for a way to arrest Jesus. But they were afraid to, because the people thought he was a prophet.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="22">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Once again Jesus used stories to teach the people: Then Jesus told them, &amp;apos;Give the Emperor what belongs to him and give God what belongs to God.&amp;apos; You are completely wrong! You don't know what the Scriptures teach. And you don't know anything about the power of God. Love the Lord your God with all your heart, soul, and mind. until I make your enemies into a footstool for you.&amp;quot;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">The kingdom of heaven is like what happened when a king gave a wedding banquet for his son.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">The king sent some servants to tell the invited guests to come to the banquet, but the guests refused.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">He sent other servants to say to the guests, &amp;apos;The banquet is ready! My cattle and prize calves have all been prepared. Everything is ready. Come to the banquet!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">But the guests did not pay any attention. Some of them left for their farms, and some went to their places of business.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Others grabbed the servants, then beat them up and killed them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">This made the king so furious that he sent an army to kill those murderers and burn down their city.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Then he said to the servants, &amp;apos;It is time for the wedding banquet, and the invited guests don't deserve to come.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Go out to the street corners and tell everyone you meet to come to the banquet.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">They went out on the streets and brought in everyone they could find, good and bad alike. And the banquet room was filled with guests.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">When the king went in to meet the guests, he found that one of them wasn't wearing the right kind of clothes for the wedding.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">The king asked, &amp;apos;Friend, why didn't you wear proper clothes for the wedding?&amp;apos; But the guest had no excuse.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">So the king gave orders for this person to be tied hand and foot and to be thrown outside into the dark. That's where people will cry and grit their teeth in pain.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Many are invited, but only a few are chosen.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">The Pharisees got together and planned how they could trick Jesus into saying something wrong.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">They sent some of their followers and some of Herod's followers to say to him, &amp;apos;Teacher, we know that you are honest. You teach the truth about what God wants people to do. And you treat everyone with the same respect, no matter who they are.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Tell us what you think! Should we pay taxes to the Emperor or not?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Jesus knew their evil thoughts and said, &amp;apos;Why are you trying to test me? You show-offs!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Let me see one of the coins used for paying taxes.&amp;apos; They brought him a silver coin,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">and he asked, &amp;apos;Whose picture and name are on it?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">&amp;apos;The Emperor's,&amp;apos; they answered.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">His answer surprised them so much that they walked away.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">The Sadducees did not believe people would rise to life after death. So that same day some of the Sadducees came to Jesus and said:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">Teacher, Moses wrote that if a married man dies and has no children, his brother should marry the widow. Their first son would then be thought of as the son of the dead brother.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">Once there were seven brothers who lived here. The first one married, but died without having any children. So his wife was left to his brother.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">The same thing happened to the second and third brothers and finally to all seven of them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">At last the woman died.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">When God raises people from death, whose wife will this woman be? She had been married to all seven brothers.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">Jesus answered:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">When God raises people to life, they won't marry. They will be like the angels in heaven.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">And as for people being raised to life, God was speaking to you when he said,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">&amp;apos;I am the God worshiped by Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.&amp;apos; He isn't the God of the dead, but of the living.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">The crowds were surprised to hear what Jesus was teaching.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">After Jesus had made the Sadducees look foolish, the Pharisees heard about it and got together.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">One of them was an expert in the Jewish Law. So he tried to test Jesus by asking,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">&amp;apos;Teacher, what is the most important commandment in the Law?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">Jesus answered:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">This is the first and most important commandment.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">The second most important commandment is like this one. And it is, &amp;apos;Love others as much as you love yourself.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">All the Law of Moses and the Books of the Prophets are based on these two commandments.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">While the Pharisees were still there, Jesus asked them,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">&amp;apos;What do you think about the Messiah? Whose family will he come from?&amp;apos; They answered, &amp;apos;He will be a son of King David.&amp;apos; Sit at my right side</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43">Jesus replied, &amp;apos;How then could the Spirit lead David to call the Messiah his Lord? David said,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44">&amp;quot;The Lord said to my Lord:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45">If David called the Messiah his Lord, how can the Messiah be a son of King David?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46">No one was able to give Jesus an answer, and from that day on, no one dared ask him any more questions.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1">Jesus said to the crowds and to his disciples: &amp;apos;Blessed is the one who comes in the name of the Lord.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">The Pharisees and the teachers of the Law are experts in the Law of Moses.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">So obey everything they teach you, but don't do as they do. After all, they say one thing and do something else.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">They pile heavy burdens on people's shoulders and won't lift a finger to help.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Everything they do is just to show off in front of others. They even make a big show of wearing Scripture verses on their foreheads and arms, and they wear big tassels for everyone to see.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">They love the best seats at banquets and the front seats in the synagogues.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">And when they are in the market, they like to have people greet them as their teachers.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">But none of you should be called a teacher. You have only one teacher, and all of you are like brothers and sisters.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Don't call anyone on earth your father. All of you have the same Father in heaven.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">None of you should be called the leader. The Messiah is your only leader.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Whoever is the greatest should be the servant of the others.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">If you put yourself above others, you will be put down. But if you humble yourself, you will be honored.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">You Pharisees and teachers of the Law of Moses are in for trouble! You're nothing but show-offs. You travel over land and sea to win one follower. And when you have done so, you make that person twice as fit for hell as you are.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">You are in for trouble! You are supposed to lead others, but you are blind. You teach that it doesn't matter if a person swears by the temple. But you say it does matter if someone swears by the gold in the temple.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">You blind fools! Which is greater, the gold or the temple that makes the gold sacred?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">You also teach that it doesn't matter if a person swears by the altar. But you say it does matter if someone swears by the gift on the altar.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Are you blind? Which is more important, the gift or the altar that makes the gift sacred?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Anyone who swears by the altar also swears by everything on it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">And anyone who swears by the temple also swears by God, who lives there.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">To swear by heaven is the same as swearing by God's throne and by the one who sits on that throne.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">You Pharisees and teachers are show-offs, and you're in for trouble! You give God a tenth of the spices from your garden, such as mint, dill, and cumin. Yet you neglect the more important matters of the Law, such as justice, mercy, and faithfulness. These are the important things you should have done, though you should not have left the others undone either.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">You blind leaders! You strain out a small fly but swallow a camel.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">You Pharisees and teachers are show-offs, and you're in for trouble! You wash the outside of your cups and dishes, while inside there is nothing but greed and selfishness.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">You blind Pharisee! First clean the inside of a cup, and then the outside will also be clean.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">You Pharisees and teachers are in for trouble! You're nothing but show-offs. You're like tombs that have been whitewashed. On the outside they are beautiful, but inside they are full of bones and filth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">That's what you are like. Outside you look good, but inside you are evil and only pretend to be good.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">You Pharisees and teachers are nothing but show-offs, and you're in for trouble! You build monuments for the prophets and decorate the tombs of good people.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">And you claim you would not have taken part with your ancestors in killing the prophets.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">But you prove you really are the relatives of the ones who killed the prophets.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">So keep on doing everything they did.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">You are nothing but snakes and the children of snakes! How can you escape going to hell?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">I will send to you prophets and wise people and experts in the Law of Moses. You will kill them or nail them to a cross or beat them in your synagogues or chase them from town to town.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">That's why you will be held guilty for the murder of every good person, beginning with the good man Abel. This also includes Barachiah's son Zechariah, the man you murdered between the temple and the altar.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">I can promise that you people living today will be punished for all these things!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">Jerusalem, Jerusalem! Your people have killed the prophets and have stoned the messengers who were sent to you. I have often wanted to gather your people, as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings. But you wouldn't let me.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1">After Jesus left the temple, his disciples came over and said, &amp;apos;Look at all these buildings!&amp;apos; Don't let anyone fool you. &amp;apos;The sun will become dark, and the moon will no longer shine. The stars will fall, will be shaken.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Jesus replied, &amp;apos;Do you see these buildings? They will certainly be torn down! Not one stone will be left in place.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Later, as Jesus was sitting on the Mount of Olives, his disciples came to him in private and asked, &amp;apos;When will this happen? What will be the sign of your coming and of the end of the world?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Jesus answered:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Many will come and claim to be me. They will say they are the Messiah, and they will fool many people.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">You will soon hear about wars and threats of wars, but don't be afraid. These things will have to happen first, but that isn't the end.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1">The kingdom of heaven is like what happened one night when ten young women took their oil lamps and went to a wedding to meet the groom.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Five of them were foolish and five were wise.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">The foolish ones took their lamps, but no extra oil.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">The ones who were wise took along extra oil for their lamps.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">The groom was late arriving, and the young women became drowsy and fell asleep.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Then in the middle of the night someone shouted, &amp;apos;Here's the groom! Come to meet him!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">When the women got up and started getting their lamps ready,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">the foolish ones said to the others, &amp;apos;Let us have some of your oil! Our lamps are going out.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Those who were wise answered, &amp;apos;There's not enough oil for all of us! Go and buy some for yourselves.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">While the foolish ones were on their way to get some oil, the groom arrived. The five who were ready went into the wedding, and the doors were closed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Later the others returned and shouted, &amp;apos;Sir, sir! Open the door for us!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">But the groom replied, &amp;apos;I don't even know you!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">So, my disciples, always be ready! You don't know the day or the time when all this will happen.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">The kingdom is also like what happened when a man went away and put his three servants in charge of all he owned.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">The man knew what each servant could do. So he handed 5,000 coins to the first servant, 2,000 to the second, and 1,000 to the third. Then he left the country.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">As soon as the man had gone, the servant with the 5,000 coins used them to earn 5,000 more.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">The servant who had 2,000 coins did the same with his money and earned 2,000 more.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">But the servant with 1,000 coins dug a hole and hid his master's money in the ground.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Some time later the master of those servants returned. He called them in and asked what they had done with his money.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">The servant who had been given 5,000 coins brought them in with the 5,000 that he had earned. He said, &amp;apos;Sir, you gave me 5,000 coins, and I have earned 5,000 more.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">&amp;apos;Wonderful!&amp;apos; his master replied. &amp;apos;You are a good and faithful servant. I left you in charge of only a little, but now I will put you in charge of much more. Come and share in my happiness!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Next, the servant who had been given 2,000 coins came in and said, &amp;apos;Sir, you gave me 2,000 coins, and I have earned 2,000 more.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">&amp;apos;Wonderful!&amp;apos; his master replied. &amp;apos;You are a good and faithful servant. I left you in charge of only a little, but now I will put you in charge of much more. Come and share in my happiness!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">The servant who had been given 1,000 coins then came in and said, &amp;apos;Sir, I know that you are hard to work for. You harvest what you don't plant and gather crops where you haven't scattered seed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">I was frightened and went out and hid your money in the ground. Here is every single coin!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">The master of the servant told him, &amp;apos;You are lazy and good-for-nothing! You know I harvest what I don't plant and gather crops where I haven't scattered seed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">You could have at least put my money in the bank, so I could have earned interest on it.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">Then the master said, &amp;apos;Now your money will be taken away and given to the servant with 10,000 coins!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">Everyone who has something will be given more, and they will have more than enough. But everything will be taken from those who don't have anything.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">You are a worthless servant, and you will be thrown out into the dark where people will cry and grit their teeth in pain.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">When the Son of Man comes in his glory with all his angels, he will sit on his royal throne.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">The people of all nations will be brought before him, and he will separate them, as shepherds separate their sheep from their goats.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">He will place the sheep on his right and the goats on his left.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="35">When I was hungry, you gave me something to eat, and when I was thirsty, you gave me something to drink. When I was a stranger, you welcomed me,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">and when I was naked, you gave me clothes to wear. When I was sick, you took care of me, and when I was in jail, you visited me.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">Then the ones who pleased the Lord will ask, &amp;apos;When did we give you something to eat or drink?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">When did we welcome you as a stranger or give you clothes to wear</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">or visit you while you were sick or in jail?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">The king will answer, &amp;apos;Whenever you did it for any of my people, no matter how unimportant they seemed, you did it for me.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">Then the king will say to those on his left, &amp;apos;Get away from me! You are under God's curse. Go into the everlasting fire prepared for the devil and his angels!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">I was hungry, but you did not give me anything to eat, and I was thirsty, but you did not give me anything to drink.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43">I was a stranger, but you did not welcome me, and I was naked, but you did not give me any clothes to wear. I was sick and in jail, but you did not take care of me.&amp;apos;</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="45">The king will say to them, &amp;apos;Whenever you failed to help any of my people, no matter how unimportant they seemed, you failed to do it for me.&amp;apos;</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1">When Jesus had finished teaching, he told his disciples,</VERS>

This is when the Son of Man will be handed over to his enemies and nailed to a cross.&amp;apos; Why are you bothering this woman? She has done a beautiful thing for me. &amp;apos;That's what you say!&amp;apos; Jesus replied. But later, Judas did betray him. &amp;quot;I will strike down the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered.&amp;quot; All the others said the same thing. The men grabbed Jesus and arrested him. All Jesus' disciples left him and ran away. &amp;quot;Soon you will see the Son of Man of God All-Powerful and coming on the clouds of heaven.&amp;quot; &amp;apos; They answered, &amp;apos;He is guilty and deserves to die!&amp;apos; Right then a rooster crowed,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">At that time the chief priests and the nation's leaders were meeting at the home of Caiaphas the high priest.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">They planned how they could sneak around and have Jesus arrested and put to death.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">But they said, &amp;apos;We must not do it during Passover, because the people will riot.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Jesus was in the town of Bethany, eating at the home of Simon, who had leprosy.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">A woman came in with a bottle of expensive perfume and poured it on Jesus' head.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">But when his disciples saw this, they became angry and complained, &amp;apos;Why such a waste?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">We could have sold this perfume for a lot of money and given it to the poor.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Jesus knew what they were thinking, and he said:</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="12">She has poured perfume on my body to prepare it for burial.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">You may be sure that wherever the good news is told all over the world, people will remember what she has done. And they will tell others.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Judas Iscariot was one of the twelve disciples. He went to the chief priests</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">and asked, &amp;apos;How much will you give me if I help you arrest Jesus?&amp;apos; They paid Judas 30 silver coins,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">and from then on he started looking for a good chance to betray Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">On the first day of the Festival of Thin Bread, Jesus' disciples came to him and asked, &amp;apos;Where do you want us to prepare the Passover meal?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Jesus told them to go to a certain man in the city and tell him, &amp;apos;Our teacher says, &amp;quot;My time has come! I want to eat the Passover meal with my disciples in your home.&amp;quot; &amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">They did as Jesus told them and prepared the meal.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="25">Judas said, &amp;apos;Teacher, you surely don't mean me!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">During the meal Jesus took some bread in his hands. He blessed the bread and broke it. Then he gave it to his disciples and said, &amp;apos;Take this and eat it. This is my body.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">Jesus picked up a cup of wine and gave thanks to God. He then gave it to his disciples and said, &amp;apos;Take this and drink it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">This is my blood, and with it God makes his agreement with you. It will be poured out, so that many people will have their sins forgiven.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">From now on I am not going to drink any wine, until I drink new wine with you in my Father's kingdom.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">Then they sang a hymn and went out to the Mount of Olives.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">Jesus said to his disciples, &amp;apos;During this very night, all of you will reject me, as the Scriptures say,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">But after I am raised to life, I will go ahead of you to Galilee.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">Peter spoke up, &amp;apos;Even if all the others reject you, I never will!&amp;apos;</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="36">Jesus went with his disciples to a place called Gethsemane. When they got there, he told them, &amp;apos;Sit here while I go over there and pray.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">Jesus took along Peter and the two brothers, James and John. He was very sad and troubled,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">and he said to them, &amp;apos;I am so sad that I feel as if I am dying. Stay here and keep awake with me.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">Jesus walked on a little way. Then he knelt with his face to the ground and prayed, &amp;apos;My Father, if it is possible, don't make me suffer by drinking from this cup. But do what you want, and not what I want.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">He came back and found his disciples sleeping. So he said to Peter, &amp;apos;Can't any of you stay awake with me for just one hour?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">Stay awake and pray that you won't be tested. You want to do what is right, but you are weak.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">Again Jesus went to pray and said, &amp;apos;My Father, if there is no other way, and I must suffer, I will still do what you want.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43">Jesus came back and found them sleeping again. They simply could not keep their eyes open.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44">He left them and prayed the same prayer once more.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45">Finally, Jesus returned to his disciples and said, &amp;apos;Are you still sleeping and resting? The time has come for the Son of Man to be handed over to sinners.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46">Get up! Let's go. The one who will betray me is already here.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="47">Jesus was still speaking, when Judas the betrayer came up. He was one of the twelve disciples, and a large mob armed with swords and clubs was with him. They had been sent by the chief priests and the nation's leaders.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="48">Judas had told them ahead of time, &amp;apos;Arrest the man I greet with a kiss.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="49">Judas walked right up to Jesus and said, &amp;apos;Hello, teacher.&amp;apos; Then Judas kissed him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="50">Jesus replied, &amp;apos;My friend, do what you came for.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="51">One of Jesus' followers pulled out a sword. He struck the servant of the high priest and cut off his ear.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="52">But Jesus told him, &amp;apos;Put your sword away. Anyone who lives by fighting will die by fighting.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="53">Don't you know that I could ask my Father, and he would at once send me more than twelve armies of angels?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="54">But then, how could the words of the Scriptures come true, which say this must happen?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="55">Jesus said to the mob, &amp;apos;Why do you come with swords and clubs to arrest me like a criminal? Day after day I sat and taught in the temple, and you didn't arrest me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="56">But all this happened, so that what the prophets wrote would come true.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="57">After Jesus had been arrested, he was led off to the house of Caiaphas the high priest. The nation's leaders and the teachers of the Law of Moses were meeting there.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="58">But Peter followed along at a distance and came to the courtyard of the high priest's palace. He went in and sat down with the guards to see what was going to happen.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="59">The chief priests and the whole council wanted to put Jesus to death. So they tried to find some people who would tell lies about him in court.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="60">But they could not find any, even though many did come and tell lies. At last, two men came forward</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="61">and said, &amp;apos;This man claimed he could tear down God's temple and build it again in three days.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="62">The high priest stood up and asked Jesus, &amp;apos;Why don't you say something in your own defense? Don't you hear the charges they are making against you?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="63">But Jesus did not answer. So the high priest said, &amp;apos;With the living God looking on, you must tell the truth. Are you the Messiah, the Son of God?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="64">&amp;apos;That is what you say!&amp;apos; Jesus answered. &amp;apos;But I tell all of you, sitting at the right side</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="65">The high priest then tore his robe and said, &amp;apos;This man claims to be God! We don't need any more witnesses! You have heard what he said.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="66">What do you think?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="67">Then they spit in his face and hit him with their fists. Others slapped him</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="68">and said, &amp;apos;You think you are the Messiah! So tell us who hit you!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="69">While Peter was sitting out in the courtyard, a servant girl came up to him and said, &amp;apos;You were with Jesus from Galilee.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="70">But in front of everyone Peter said, &amp;apos;That isn't so! I don't know what you are talking about!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="71">When Peter had gone out to the gate, another servant girl saw him and said to some people there, &amp;apos;This man was with Jesus from Nazareth.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="72">Again Peter denied it, and this time he swore, &amp;apos;I don't even know that man!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="73">A little while later some people standing there walked over to Peter and said, &amp;apos;We know you are one of them. We can tell it because you talk like someone from Galilee.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="74">Peter began to curse and swear, &amp;apos;I don't know that man!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="75">and Peter remembered that Jesus had said, &amp;apos;Before a rooster crows, you will say three times you don't know me.&amp;apos; Then Peter went out and cried bitterly.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="27">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Early the next morning all the chief priests and the nation's leaders met and decided that Jesus should be put to death.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">They tied him up and led him away to Pilate the governor. &amp;apos;So what? That's your problem,&amp;apos; they replied. &amp;apos;They took the thirty silver coins, the price of a person among the people of Israel. as the Lord had commanded me.&amp;apos; &amp;apos;Those are your words!&amp;apos; Jesus answered. &amp;apos;Barabbas!&amp;apos; they shouted. They all yelled, &amp;apos;Nail him to a cross!&amp;apos; &amp;apos;Nail him to a cross!&amp;apos; they yelled even louder.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Judas had betrayed Jesus, but when he learned that Jesus had been sentenced to death, he was sorry for what he had done. He returned the 30 silver coins to the chief priests and leaders</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">and said, &amp;apos;I have sinned by betraying a man who has never done anything wrong.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Judas threw the money into the temple and then went out and hanged himself.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">The chief priests picked up the money and said, &amp;apos;This money was paid to have a man killed. We can't put it in the temple treasury.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Then they had a meeting and decided to buy a field that belonged to someone who made clay pots. They wanted to use it as a graveyard for foreigners.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">This is why people still call that place &amp;apos;Field of Blood.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">So the words of the prophet Jeremiah came true,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">They paid it for a potter's field,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Jesus was brought before Pilate the governor, who asked him, &amp;apos;Are you the king of the Jews?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">And when the chief priests and leaders brought their charges against him, he did not say a thing.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Pilate asked him, &amp;apos;Don't you hear what crimes they say you have done?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">But Jesus did not say anything, and the governor was greatly amazed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">During Passover the governor always freed a prisoner chosen by the people.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">At that time a well-known terrorist named Jesus Barabbas was in jail.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">So when the crowd came together, Pilate asked them, &amp;apos;Which prisoner do you want me to set free? Do you want Jesus Barabbas or Jesus who is called the Messiah?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Pilate knew the leaders had brought Jesus to him because they were jealous.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">While Pilate was judging the case, his wife sent him a message. It said, &amp;apos;Don't have anything to do with that innocent man. I have had nightmares because of him.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">But the chief priests and the leaders convinced the crowds to ask for Barabbas to be set free and for Jesus to be killed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Pilate asked the crowd again, &amp;apos;Which of these two men do you want me to set free?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Pilate asked them, &amp;apos;What am I to do with Jesus, who is called the Messiah?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">Pilate answered, &amp;apos;But what crime has he done?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">Pilate saw that there was nothing he could do and that the people were starting to riot. So he took some water and washed his hands in front of them and said, &amp;apos;I won't have anything to do with killing this man. You are the ones doing it!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">Everyone answered, &amp;apos;We and our own families will take the blame for his death!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">Pilate set Barabbas free. Then he ordered his soldiers to beat Jesus with a whip and nail him to a cross.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">The governor's soldiers led Jesus into the fortress and brought together the rest of the troops.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">They stripped off Jesus' clothes and put a scarlet robe on him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">They made a crown out of thorn branches and placed it on his head, and they put a stick in his right hand. The soldiers knelt down and pretended to worship him. They made fun of him and shouted, &amp;apos;Hey, you king of the Jews!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">Then they spit on him. They took the stick from him and beat him on the head with it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">When the soldiers had finished making fun of Jesus, they took off the robe. They put his own clothes back on him and led him off to be nailed to a cross.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">On the way they met a man named Simon who was from Cyrene, and they forced him to carry Jesus' cross.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">They came to a place named Golgotha, which means &amp;apos;Place of a Skull.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">There they gave Jesus some wine mixed with a drug to ease the pain. But when Jesus tasted what it was, he refused to drink it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">The soldiers nailed Jesus to a cross and gambled to see who would get his clothes.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">Then they sat down to guard him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">Above his head they put a sign that told why he was nailed there. It read, &amp;apos;This is Jesus, the King of the Jews.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">The soldiers also nailed two criminals on crosses, one to the right of Jesus and the other to his left.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">People who passed by said terrible things about Jesus. They shook their heads and</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">shouted, &amp;apos;So you're the one who claimed you could tear down the temple and build it again in three days! If you are God's Son, save yourself and come down from the cross!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">The chief priests, the leaders, and the teachers of the Law of Moses also made fun of Jesus. They said,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">&amp;apos;He saved others, but he can't save himself. If he is the king of Israel, he should come down from the cross! Then we will believe him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43">He trusted God, so let God save him, if he wants to. He even said he was God's Son.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44">The two criminals also said cruel things to Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45">At noon the sky turned dark and stayed that way until three o'clock.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46">Then about that time Jesus shouted, &amp;apos;Eli, Eli, lema sabachthani?&amp;apos; which means, &amp;apos;My God, my God, why have you deserted me?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="47">Some of the people standing there heard Jesus and said, &amp;apos;He's calling for Elijah.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="48">One of them at once ran and grabbed a sponge. He soaked it in wine, then put it on a stick and held it up to Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="49">Others said, &amp;apos;Wait! Let's see if Elijah will come and save him.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="50">Once again Jesus shouted, and then he died.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="51">At once the curtain in the temple was torn in two from top to bottom. The earth shook, and rocks split apart.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="52">Graves opened, and many of God's people were raised to life.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="53">They left their graves, and after Jesus had risen to life, they went into the holy city, where they were seen by many people.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="54">The officer and the soldiers guarding Jesus felt the earthquake and saw everything else that happened. They were frightened and said, &amp;apos;This man really was God's Son!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="55">Many women had come with Jesus from Galilee to be of help to him, and they were there, looking on at a distance.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="56">Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James and Joseph, and the mother of James and John were some of these women.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="57">That evening a rich disciple named Joseph from the town of Arimathea</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="58">went and asked for Jesus' body. Pilate gave orders for it to be given to Joseph,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="59">who took the body and wrapped it in a clean linen cloth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="60">Then Joseph put the body in his own tomb that had been cut into solid rock and had never been used. He rolled a big stone against the entrance to the tomb and went away.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="61">All this time Mary Magdalene and the other Mary were sitting across from the tomb.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="62">On the next day, which was a Sabbath, the chief priests and the Pharisees went together to Pilate.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="63">They said, &amp;apos;Sir, we remember what this liar said while he was still alive. He claimed in three days he would come back from death.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="64">So please order the tomb to be carefully guarded for three days. If you don't, his disciples may come and steal his body. They will tell the people he has been raised to life, and this last lie will be worse than the first one.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="65">Pilate said to them, &amp;apos;All right, take some of your soldiers and guard the tomb as well as you know how.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="66">So they sealed it tight and placed soldiers there to guard it.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="28">
			<VERS vnumber="1">The Sabbath was over, and it was almost daybreak on Sunday when Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to see the tomb.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Suddenly a strong earthquake struck, and the Lord's angel came down from heaven. He rolled away the stone and sat on it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">The angel looked as bright as lightning, and his clothes were white as snow.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">The guards shook from fear and fell down, as though they were dead. I have been given all authority in heaven and on earth!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">The angel said to the women, &amp;apos;Don't be afraid! I know you are looking for Jesus, who was nailed to a cross.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">He isn't here! God has raised him to life, just as Jesus said he would. Come, see the place where his body was lying.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Now hurry! Tell his disciples he has been raised to life and is on his way to Galilee. Go there, and you will see him. This is what I came to tell you.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">The women were frightened and yet very happy, as they hurried from the tomb and ran to tell his disciples.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Suddenly Jesus met them and greeted them. They went near him, held on to his feet, and worshiped him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Then Jesus said, &amp;apos;Don't be afraid! Tell my followers to go to Galilee. They will see me there.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">While the women were on their way, some soldiers who had been guarding the tomb went into the city. They told the chief priests everything that had happened.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">So the chief priests met with the leaders and decided to bribe the soldiers with a lot of money.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">They said to the soldiers, &amp;apos;Tell everyone that Jesus' disciples came during the night and stole his body while you were asleep.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">If the governor hears about this, we will talk to him. You won't have anything to worry about.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">The soldiers took the money and did what they were told. The people of Judea still tell each other this story.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Jesus' eleven disciples went to a mountain in Galilee, where Jesus had told them to meet him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">They saw him and worshiped him, but some of them doubted.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Jesus came to them and said:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Go to the people of all nations and make them my disciples. Baptize them in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">and teach them to do everything I have told you. I will be with you always, even until the end of the world.</VERS>

	<BIBLEBOOK bnumber="41" bname="Mark">
		<CHAPTER cnumber="1">
			<VERS vnumber="1">This is the good news about Jesus Christ, the Son of God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">It began just as God had said in the book written by Isaiah the prophet, &amp;apos;I am sending my messenger to get the way ready for you. someone is shouting, &amp;quot;Get the road ready for the Lord! Make a straight path for him.&amp;quot; &amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">In the desert</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">So John the Baptist showed up in the desert and told everyone, &amp;apos;Turn back to God and be baptized! Then your sins will be forgiven.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">From all Judea and Jerusalem crowds of people went to John. They told how sorry they were for their sins, and he baptized them in the Jordan River.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">John wore clothes made of camel's hair. He had a leather strap around his waist and ate grasshoppers and wild honey.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">John also told the people, &amp;apos;Someone more powerful is going to come. And I am not good enough even to stoop down and untie his sandals.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">I baptize you with water, but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">About that time Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee, and John baptized him in the Jordan River.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">As soon as Jesus came out of the water, he saw the sky open and the Holy Spirit coming down to him like a dove.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">A voice from heaven said, &amp;apos;You are my own dear Son, and I am pleased with you.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">At once God's Spirit made Jesus go into the desert.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">He stayed there for 40 days while Satan tested him. Jesus was with the wild animals, but angels took care of him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">After John was arrested, Jesus went to Galilee and told the good news that comes from God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">He said, &amp;apos;The time has come! God's kingdom will soon be here. Turn back to God and believe the good news!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">As Jesus was walking along the shore of Lake Galilee, he saw Simon and his brother Andrew. They were fishermen and were casting their nets into the lake.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Jesus said to them, &amp;apos;Follow me! I will teach you how to bring in people instead of fish.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Right then the two brothers dropped their nets and went with him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Jesus walked on and soon saw James and John, the sons of Zebedee. They were in a boat, mending their nets.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">At once Jesus asked them to come with him. They left their father in the boat with the hired workers and went with him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Jesus and his disciples went to the town of Capernaum. Then on the next Sabbath he went into the synagogue and started teaching.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Everyone was amazed at his teaching. He taught with authority, and not like the teachers of the Law of Moses.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">Suddenly a man with an evil spirit in him entered the synagogue and yelled,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">&amp;apos;Jesus from Nazareth, what do you want with us? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are! You are God's Holy One.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">Jesus told the evil spirit, &amp;apos;Be quiet and come out of the man!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">The spirit shook him. Then it gave a loud shout and left.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">Everyone was completely surprised and kept saying to each other, &amp;apos;What is this? It must be some new kind of powerful teaching! Even the evil spirits obey him.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">News about Jesus quickly spread all over Galilee.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">As soon as Jesus left the synagogue with James and John, they went home with Simon and Andrew.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">When they got there, Jesus was told that Simon's mother-in-law was sick in bed with fever.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">Jesus went to her. He took hold of her hand and helped her up. The fever left her, and she served them a meal.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">That evening after sunset, all who were sick or had demons in them were brought to Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">In fact, the whole town gathered around the door of the house.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">Jesus healed all kinds of terrible diseases and forced out a lot of demons. But the demons knew who he was, and he did not let them speak.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">Very early the next morning before daylight, Jesus got up and went to a place where he could be alone and pray.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">Simon and the others started looking for him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">And when they found him, they said, &amp;apos;Everyone is looking for you!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">Jesus replied, &amp;apos;We must go to the nearby towns, so that I can tell the good news to those people. This is why I have come.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">Then Jesus went to their synagogues everywhere in Galilee, where he preached and forced out demons.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">A man with leprosy came to Jesus and knelt down. He begged, &amp;apos;You have the power to make me well, if only you wanted to.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">Jesus felt sorry for the man. So he put his hand on him and said, &amp;apos;I want to! Now you are well.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">At once the man's leprosy disappeared, and he was well.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43">After Jesus strictly warned the man, he sent him on his way.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44">He said, &amp;apos;Don't tell anyone about this. Just go and show the priest that you are well. Then take a gift to the temple as Moses commanded, and everyone will know that you have been healed.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45">The man talked about it so much and told so many people, that Jesus could no longer go openly into a town. He had to stay away from the towns, but people still came to him from everywhere.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="2">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Jesus went back to Capernaum, and a few days later people heard that he was at home.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Then so many of them came to the house that there wasn't even standing room left in front of the door. Jesus was still teaching The friends of a bridegroom don't go without eating while he is still with them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">when four people came up, carrying a man on a mat because he could not walk.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">But because of the crowd, they could not get him to Jesus. So they made a hole in the roof above him and let the man down in front of everyone.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">When Jesus saw how much faith they had, he said to the man, &amp;apos;My friend, your sins are forgiven.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Some of the teachers of the Law of Moses were sitting there. They started wondering,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">&amp;apos;Why would he say such a thing? He must think he is God! Only God can forgive sins.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">At once, Jesus knew what they were thinking, and he said, &amp;apos;Why are you thinking such things?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Is it easier for me to tell this man his sins are forgiven or to tell him to get up and pick up his mat and go on home?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">I will show you that the Son of Man has the right to forgive sins here on earth.&amp;apos; So Jesus said to the man,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">&amp;apos;Get up! Pick up your mat and go on home.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">The man got right up. He picked up his mat and went out while everyone watched in amazement. They praised God and said, &amp;apos;We have never seen anything like this!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Once again, Jesus went to the shore of Lake Galilee. A large crowd gathered around him, and he taught them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">As he walked along, he saw Levi, the son of Alphaeus. Levi was sitting at the place for paying taxes, and Jesus said to him, &amp;apos;Follow me!&amp;apos; So he got up and went with Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Later, Jesus and his disciples were having dinner at Levi's house. Many tax collectors and other sinners had become followers of Jesus, and they were also guests at the dinner.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Some of the teachers of the Law of Moses were Pharisees, and they saw Jesus eating with sinners and tax collectors. So they asked his disciples, &amp;apos;Why does he eat with tax collectors and sinners?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Jesus heard them and answered, &amp;apos;Healthy people don't need a doctor, but sick people do. I didn't come to invite good people to be my followers. I came to invite sinners.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">The followers of John the Baptist and the Pharisees often went without eating. Some people came and asked Jesus, &amp;apos;Why do the followers of John and those of the Pharisees often go without eating, while your disciples never do?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Jesus answered:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">But the time will come when he will be taken from them. Then they will go without eating.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">No one patches old clothes by sewing on a piece of new cloth. The new piece would shrink and tear a bigger hole.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">No one pours new wine into old wineskins. The wine would swell and burst the old skins. Then the wine would be lost, and the skins would be ruined. New wine must be put into new wineskins.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">One Sabbath Jesus and his disciples were walking through some wheat fields. His disciples were picking grains of wheat as they went along.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">Some Pharisees asked Jesus, &amp;apos;Why are your disciples picking grain on the Sabbath? They are not supposed to do that!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">Jesus answered, &amp;apos;Haven't you read what David did when he and his followers were hungry and in need?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">It was during the time of Abiathar the high priest. David went into the house of God and ate the sacred loaves of bread that only priests are allowed to eat. He also gave some to his followers.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">Jesus finished by saying, &amp;apos;People were not made for the good of the Sabbath. The Sabbath was made for the good of people.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">So the Son of Man is Lord over the Sabbath.&amp;apos;</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1">The next time Jesus went into the synagogue, a man with a paralyzed hand was there.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">The Pharisees wanted to accuse Jesus of doing something wrong, and they kept watching to see if Jesus would heal him on the Sabbath. How can Satan force himself out?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Jesus told the man to stand up where everyone could see him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Then he asked, &amp;apos;On the Sabbath should we do good deeds or evil deeds? Should we save someone's life or destroy it?&amp;apos; But no one said a word.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Jesus was angry as he looked around at the people. Yet he felt sorry for them because they were so stubborn. Then he told the man, &amp;apos;Stretch out your hand.&amp;apos; He did, and his bad hand was healed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">The Pharisees left. And at once they started making plans with Herod's followers to kill Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Jesus led his disciples down to the shore of the lake. Large crowds followed him from Galilee, Judea,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">and Jerusalem. People came from Idumea, as well as other places east of the Jordan River. They also came from the region around the towns of Tyre and Sidon. All of these crowds came because they had heard what Jesus was doing.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">He even had to tell his disciples to get a boat ready to keep him from being crushed by the crowds.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">After Jesus had healed many people, the other sick people begged him to let them touch him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">And whenever any evil spirits saw Jesus, they would fall to the ground and shout, &amp;apos;You are the Son of God!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">But Jesus warned the spirits not to tell who he was.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Jesus decided to ask some of his disciples to go up on a mountain with him, and they went.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Then he chose twelve of them to be his apostles, so they could be with him. He also wanted to send them out to preach</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">and to force out demons.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Simon was one of the twelve, and Jesus named him Peter.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">There were also James and John, the two sons of Zebedee. Jesus called them Boanerges, which means &amp;apos;Thunderbolts.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Andrew, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, James son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus were also apostles. The others were Simon, known as the Eager One,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">and Judas Iscariot, who later betrayed Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Jesus went back home, and once again such a large crowd gathered that there was no chance even to eat.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">When Jesus' family heard what he was doing, they thought he was crazy and went to get him under control.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Some teachers of the Law of Moses came from Jerusalem and said, &amp;apos;This man is under the power of Beelzebul, the ruler of demons! He is even forcing out demons with the help of Beelzebul.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">Jesus told the people to gather around him. Then he spoke to them in riddles and said:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">A nation whose people fight each other won't last very long.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">And a family that fights won't last long either.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">So if Satan fights against himself, that will be the end of him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">How can anyone break into the house of a strong man and steal his things, unless he first ties up the strong man? Then he can take everything.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">I promise you that any of the sinful things you say or do can be forgiven, no matter how terrible those things are.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">But if you speak against the Holy Spirit, you can never be forgiven. That sin will be held against you forever.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">Jesus said this because the people were saying that he had an evil spirit in him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">Jesus' mother and brothers came and stood outside. Then they sent someone with a message for him to come out to them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">The crowd sitting around Jesus told him, &amp;apos;Your mother and your brothers and sisters are outside and want to see you.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">Jesus asked, &amp;apos;Who is my mother and who are my brothers?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">Then he looked at the people sitting around him and said, &amp;apos;Here are my mother and my brothers.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">Anyone who obeys God is my brother or sister or mother.&amp;apos;</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="4">
			<VERS vnumber="1">The next time Jesus taught beside Lake Galilee, a big crowd gathered. It was so large that he had to sit in a boat out on the lake, while the people stood on the shore.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">He used stories to teach them many things, and this is part of what he taught: I have explained the secret about God's kingdom to you, but for others I can use only stories. &amp;apos;These people will look and look, but never see. They will listen and listen, but never understand. If they did, they would turn to God and be forgiven.&amp;apos; If you don't understand this story, you won't understand any others. You don't light a lamp and put it under a clay pot or under a bed. Don't you put a lamp on a lampstand? God's kingdom is like what happens when a farmer scatters seed in a field. What is God's kingdom like? What story can I use to explain it?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Now listen! A farmer went out to scatter seed in a field.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">While the farmer was scattering the seed, some of it fell along the road and was eaten by birds.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Other seeds fell on thin, rocky ground and quickly started growing because the soil wasn't very deep.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">But when the sun came up, the plants were scorched and dried up, because they did not have deep roots.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Some other seeds fell where thornbushes grew up and choked out the plants. So they did not produce any grain.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">But a few seeds did fall on good ground where the plants grew and produced 30 or 60 or even 100 times as much as was scattered.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Then Jesus said, &amp;apos;If you have ears, pay attention.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">When Jesus was alone with the twelve apostles and some others, they asked him about these stories.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">He answered:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">The reason is,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Jesus then told them:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">What the farmer is spreading is really the message about the kingdom.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">The seeds that fell along the road are the people who hear the message. But Satan soon comes and snatches it away from them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">The seeds that fell on rocky ground are the people who gladly hear the message and accept it at once.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">But they don't have roots, and they don't last very long. As soon as life gets hard or the message gets them in trouble, they give up.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">The seeds that fell among the thornbushes are also people who hear the message.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">But they start worrying about the needs of this life. They are fooled by the desire to get rich and to have all kinds of other things. So the message gets choked out, and they never produce anything.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">The seeds that fell on good ground are the people who hear and welcome the message. They produce 30 or 60 or even 100 times as much as was planted.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Jesus also said:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">There is nothing hidden that will not be made public. There is no secret that will not be well known.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">If you have ears, pay attention!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">Listen carefully to what you hear! The way you treat others will be the way you will be treated&amp;ndash;and even worse.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">Everyone who has something will be given more. But people who don't have anything will lose what little they have.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">Again Jesus said:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">The farmer sleeps at night and is up and around during the day. Yet the seeds keep sprouting and growing, and he doesn't understand how.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">It is the ground that makes the seeds sprout and grow into plants that produce grain.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">Then when harvest season comes and the grain is ripe, the farmer cuts it with a sickle.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">Finally, Jesus said:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">It is like what happens when a mustard seed is planted in the ground. It is the smallest seed in all the world.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">But once it is planted, it grows larger than any garden plant. It even puts out branches that are big enough for birds to nest in its shade.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">Jesus used many other stories when he spoke to the people, and he taught them as much as they could understand.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">He did not tell them anything without using stories. But when he was alone with his disciples, he explained everything to them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">That evening, Jesus said to his disciples, &amp;apos;Let's cross to the east side.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">So they left the crowd, and his disciples started across the lake with him in the boat. Some other boats followed along.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">Suddenly a storm struck the lake. Waves started splashing into the boat, and it was about to sink.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">Jesus was in the back of the boat with his head on a pillow, and he was asleep. His disciples woke him and said, &amp;apos;Teacher, don't you care that we're about to drown?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">Jesus got up and ordered the wind and the waves to be quiet. The wind stopped, and everything was calm.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">Jesus asked his disciples, &amp;apos;Why were you afraid? Don't you have any faith?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">Now they were more afraid than ever and said to each other, &amp;apos;Who is this? Even the wind and the waves obey him!&amp;apos;</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="5">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Jesus and his disciples crossed Lake Galilee and came to shore near the town of Gerasa.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">When he was getting out of the boat, a man with an evil spirit quickly ran to him</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">from the graveyard where he had been living. No one was able to tie the man up anymore, not even with a chain.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">He had often been put in chains and leg irons, but he broke the chains and smashed the leg irons. No one could control him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Night and day he was in the graveyard or on the hills, yelling and cutting himself with stones. The man answered, &amp;apos;My name is Lots, because I have &amp;quot;lots&amp;quot; of evil spirits.&amp;apos; After Jesus had sent them all out of the house, he took the girl's father and mother and his three disciples and went to where she was. Everyone was greatly surprised.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">When the man saw Jesus in the distance, he ran up to him and knelt down.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">He shouted, &amp;apos;Jesus, Son of God in heaven, what do you want with me? Promise me in God's name that you won't torture me!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">The man said this because Jesus had already told the evil spirit to come out of him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Jesus asked, &amp;apos;What is your name?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">He then begged Jesus not to send them away.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Over on the hillside a large herd of pigs was feeding.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">So the evil spirits begged Jesus, &amp;apos;Send us into those pigs! Let us go into them.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Jesus let them go, and they went out of the man and into the pigs. The whole herd of about 2,000 pigs rushed down the steep bank into the lake and drowned.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">The men taking care of the pigs ran to the town and the farms to spread the news. Then the people came out to see what had happened.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">When they came to Jesus, they saw the man who had once been full of demons. He was sitting there with his clothes on and in his right mind, and they were terrified.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Everyone who had seen what had happened told about the man and the pigs.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Then the people started begging Jesus to leave their part of the country.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">When Jesus was getting into the boat, the man begged to go with him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">But Jesus would not let him. Instead, he said, &amp;apos;Go home to your family and tell them how much the Lord has done for you and how good he has been to you.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">The man went away into the region near the ten cities known as Decapolis and began telling everyone how much Jesus had done for him. Everyone who heard what had happened was amazed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Once again Jesus got into the boat and crossed Lake Galilee. Then as he stood on the shore, a large crowd gathered around him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">The person in charge of the synagogue was also there. His name was Jairus, and when he saw Jesus, he went over to him. He knelt at Jesus' feet</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">and started begging him for help. He said, &amp;apos;My little daughter is about to die! Please come and touch her, so she will get well and live.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">Jesus went with Jairus. Many people followed along and kept crowding around.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">In the crowd was a woman who had been bleeding for twelve years.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">She had gone to many doctors, and they had not done anything except cause her a lot of pain. She had paid them all the money she had. But instead of getting better, she only got worse.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">The woman had heard about Jesus, so she came up behind him in the crowd and barely touched his clothes.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">She had said to herself, &amp;apos;If I can just touch his clothes, I will be healed.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">As soon as she touched them, her bleeding stopped, and she knew she was healed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">At that moment Jesus felt power go out from him. He turned to the crowd and asked, &amp;apos;Who touched my clothes?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">His disciples said to him, &amp;apos;Look at all these people crowding around you! How can you ask who touched you?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">But Jesus turned to see who had touched him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">The woman knew what had happened to her. So she came trembling with fear and knelt down in front of Jesus. Then she told him the whole story.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">Jesus said to the woman, &amp;apos;You are now well because of your faith. May God give you peace! You are healed, and you will no longer be in pain.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">While Jesus was still speaking, some people came from Jairus' home and said, &amp;apos;Your daughter has died! Why bother the teacher anymore?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">Jesus heard what they said, and he said to Jairus, &amp;apos;Don't worry. Just have faith!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">Jesus did not let anyone go with him except Peter and the two brothers, James and John.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">They went home with Jairus and saw the people crying and making a lot of noise.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">Then Jesus went inside and said to them, &amp;apos;Why are you crying and carrying on like this? The child isn't dead. She is just asleep.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">But the people laughed at him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43">But Jesus ordered them not to tell anyone what had happened. Then he said, &amp;apos;Give her something to eat.&amp;apos;</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="6">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Jesus left and returned to his hometown with his disciples.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">The next Sabbath he taught in the synagogue. Many of the people who heard him were amazed and asked, &amp;apos;How can he do all this? Where did he get such wisdom and the power to work these miracles?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Isn't he the carpenter, the son of Mary? Aren't James, Joseph, Judas, and Simon his brothers? Don't his sisters still live here in our town?&amp;apos; The people were upset because of what he was doing. Jesus taught in all the neighboring villages. Her mother answered, &amp;apos;The head of John the Baptist!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">But Jesus said, &amp;apos;Prophets are honored by everyone, except the people of their hometown and their relatives and their own family.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Jesus could not work any miracles there, except to heal a few sick people by placing his hands on them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">He was surprised that the people did not have any faith.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Then he called together his twelve apostles and sent them out two by two with power over evil spirits.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">He told them, &amp;apos;You may take along a walking stick. But don't carry food or a traveling bag or any money.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">It's all right to wear sandals, but don't take along a change of clothes.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">When you are welcomed into a home, stay there until you leave that town.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">If any place won't welcome you or listen to your message, leave and shake the dust from your feet as a warning to them.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">The apostles left and started telling everyone to turn to God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">They forced out many demons and healed a lot of sick people by putting olive oil on them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Jesus became so well-known that Herod the ruler heard about him. Some people thought he was John the Baptist, who had come back to life with the power to work miracles.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Others thought he was Elijah or some other prophet who had lived long ago.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">But when Herod heard about Jesus, he said, &amp;apos;This must be John! I had his head cut off, and now he has come back to life.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Herodias had a grudge against John and wanted to kill him. But she could not do it</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">because Herod was afraid of John and protected him. He knew that John was a good and holy man. Even though Herod was confused by what John said, he was glad to listen to him. And he often did.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Finally, Herodias got her chance when Herod gave a great birthday celebration for himself and invited his officials, his army officers, and the leaders of Galilee.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">The daughter of Herodias came in and danced for Herod and his guests. She pleased them so much that Herod said, &amp;apos;Ask for anything, and it's yours!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">I swear that I will give you as much as half of my kingdom, if you want it.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">The girl left and asked her mother, &amp;apos;What do you think I should ask for?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">The girl hurried back and told Herod, &amp;apos;Here and now on a serving plate I want the head of John the Baptist!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">Herod was very sorry for what he had said. But he did not want to break the promise he had made in front of his guests.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">At once he ordered a guard to cut off John's head there in prison.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">The guard put the head on a serving plate and took it to the girl. Then she gave it to her mother.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">When John's followers learned that he had been killed, they took his body and put it in a tomb.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">After the apostles returned to Jesus, they told him everything they had done and taught.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">But so many people were coming and going that Jesus and the apostles did not even have a chance to eat. Then Jesus said, &amp;apos;Let's go to a place where we can be alone and get some rest.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">They left in a boat for a place where they could be alone.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">But many people saw them leave and figured out where they were going. So people from every town ran on ahead and got there first.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">When Jesus got out of the boat, he saw the large crowd that was like sheep without a shepherd. He felt sorry for the people and started teaching them many things.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">That evening the disciples came to Jesus and said, &amp;apos;This place is like a desert, and it's already late.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">Let the crowds leave, so they can go to the farms and villages near here and buy something to eat.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">Jesus replied, &amp;apos;You give them something to eat.&amp;apos; But they asked him, &amp;apos;Don't you know it would take almost a year's wages to buy all of these people something to eat?&amp;apos; They found out and answered, &amp;apos;We have five small loaves of bread and two fish.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">Then Jesus said, &amp;apos;How much bread do you have? Go and see!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">Jesus told his disciples to tell the people to sit down on the green grass.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">They sat down in groups of 100 and groups of 50.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">Jesus took the five loaves and the two fish. He looked up toward heaven and blessed the food. Then he broke the bread and handed it to his disciples to give to the people. He also divided the two fish, so everyone could have some.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">After everyone had eaten all they wanted,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43">Jesus' disciples picked up twelve large baskets of leftover bread and fish.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44">There were 5,000 men who ate the food.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45">At once, Jesus made his disciples get into the boat and start back across to Bethsaida. But he stayed until he had sent the crowds away.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46">Then he told them goodbye and went up on the side of a mountain to pray.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="47">Later in the evening he was still there by himself, and the boat was somewhere in the middle of the lake.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="48">He could see that the disciples were struggling hard, because they were rowing against the wind. Not long before morning, Jesus came toward them. He was walking on the water and was about to pass the boat.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="49">When the disciples saw Jesus walking on the water, they thought he was a ghost, and they started screaming.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="50">All of them saw him and were terrified. But at this same time he said, &amp;apos;Don't worry! I am Jesus. Don't be afraid.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="51">He then got into the boat with them, and the wind died down. The disciples were completely confused.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="52">Their minds were closed, and they could not understand the true meaning of the loaves of bread.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="53">Jesus and his disciples crossed the lake and brought the boat to shore near the town of Gennesaret.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="54">As soon as they got out of the boat, the people recognized Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="55">So they ran all over that part of the country to bring their sick people to him on mats. They brought them each time they heard where he was.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="56">In every village or farm or marketplace where Jesus went, the people brought their sick to him. They begged him to let them just touch his clothes, and everyone who did was healed.</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="7">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Some Pharisees and several teachers of the Law of Moses from Jerusalem came and gathered around Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">They noticed that some of his disciples ate without first washing their hands. You are nothing but show-offs! The prophet Isaiah was right when he wrote that God had said, &amp;apos;All of you praise me with your words, but you never really think about me. to worship me, when you teach rules made up by humans.&amp;apos; What comes from your heart is what makes you unclean.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">The Pharisees and many others obey the teachings of their ancestors. They always wash their hands in the proper way before eating.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">None of them will eat anything they buy in the market until it is washed. They also follow a lot of other teachings, such as washing cups, pitchers, and bowls.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">The Pharisees and teachers asked Jesus, &amp;apos;Why don't your disciples obey what our ancestors taught us to do? Why do they eat without washing their hands?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Jesus replied:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">It is useless for you</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">You disobey God's commands in order to obey what humans have taught.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">You are good at rejecting God's commands so that you can follow your own teachings!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Didn't Moses command you to respect your father and mother? Didn't he tell you to put to death all who curse their parents?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">But you let people get by without helping their parents when they should. You let them say that what they own has been offered to God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">You won't let those people help their parents.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">And you ignore God's commands in order to follow your own teaching. You do a lot of other things just as bad.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Jesus called the crowd together again and said, &amp;apos;Pay attention and try to understand what I mean.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">After Jesus and his disciples had left the crowd and gone into the house, they asked him what these sayings meant.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">He answered, &amp;apos;Don't you know what I am talking about by now? You surely know that the food you put into your mouth cannot make you unclean.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">It doesn't go into your heart, but into your stomach, and then out of your body.&amp;apos; By saying this, Jesus meant that all foods were fit to eat.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Then Jesus said:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Out of your heart come evil thoughts, vulgar deeds, stealing, murder,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">unfaithfulness in marriage, greed, meanness, deceit, indecency, envy, insults, pride, and foolishness.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">All of these come from your heart, and they are what make you unfit to worship God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">Jesus left and went to the region near the town of Tyre, where he stayed in someone's home. He did not want people to know he was there, but they found out anyway.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">A woman whose daughter had an evil spirit in her heard where Jesus was. And at once she came and knelt down at his feet.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">The woman was Greek and had been born in the part of Syria known as Phoenicia. She begged Jesus to force the demon out of her daughter.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">But Jesus said, &amp;apos;The children must first be fed! It isn't right to take away their food and feed it to dogs.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">The woman replied, &amp;apos;Lord, even puppies eat the crumbs that children drop from the table.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">Jesus answered, &amp;apos;That's true! You may go now. The demon has left your daughter.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">When the woman got back home, she found her child lying on the bed. The demon had gone.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">Jesus left the region around Tyre and went by way of Sidon toward Lake Galilee. He went through the land near the ten cities known as Decapolis.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">Some people brought to him a man who was deaf and could hardly talk. They begged Jesus just to touch him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">After Jesus had taken him aside from the crowd, he stuck his fingers in the man's ears. Then he spit and put it on the man's tongue.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">Jesus looked up toward heaven, and with a groan he said, &amp;apos;Effatha!&amp;apos; which means &amp;apos;Open up!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">At once the man could hear, and he had no more trouble talking clearly.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">Jesus told the people not to say anything about what he had done. But the more he told them, the more they talked about it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">They were completely amazed and said, &amp;apos;Everything he does is good! He even heals people who cannot hear or talk.&amp;apos;</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="8">
			<VERS vnumber="1">One day another large crowd gathered around Jesus. They had not brought along anything to eat. So Jesus called his disciples together and said,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">&amp;apos;I feel sorry for these people. They have been with me for three days, and they don't have anything to eat.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Some of them live a long way from here. If I send them away hungry, they might faint on their way home.&amp;apos; As soon as Jesus had sent the people away, &amp;apos;Yes,&amp;apos; the disciples answered. &amp;apos;There were twelve baskets.&amp;apos; &amp;apos;Seven,&amp;apos; they answered. &amp;apos;You are the Messiah!&amp;apos; Peter replied. Peter took Jesus aside and told him to stop talking like that. If any of you want to be my followers, you must forget about yourself. You must take up your cross and follow me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">The disciples said, &amp;apos;This place is like a desert. Where can we find enough food to feed such a crowd?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Jesus asked them how much food they had. They replied, &amp;apos;Seven small loaves of bread.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">After Jesus told the crowd to sit down, he took the seven loaves and gave thanks. He then broke the loaves and handed them to his disciples, who passed them out to the crowd.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">They also had a few little fish, and after Jesus had blessed these, he told the disciples to pass them around.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">he got into the boat with the disciples and crossed to the territory near Dalmanutha.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">The Pharisees came out and started an argument with Jesus. They wanted to test him by asking for a sign from heaven.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Jesus groaned and said, &amp;apos;Why are you always looking for a sign? I can promise you that you will not be given one!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Then he left them. He again got into a boat and crossed over to the other side of the lake.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">The disciples had forgotten to bring any bread, and they had only one loaf with them in the boat.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Jesus warned them, &amp;apos;Watch out! Guard against the yeast of the Pharisees and of Herod.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">The disciples talked this over and said to each other, &amp;apos;He must be saying this because we don't have any bread.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Jesus knew what they were thinking and asked, &amp;apos;Why are you talking about not having any bread? Don't you understand? Are your minds still closed?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Are your eyes blind and your ears deaf? Don't you remember</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">how many baskets of leftovers you picked up when I fed those 5,000 people with only five small loaves of bread?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Jesus then asked, &amp;apos;And how many baskets of leftovers did you pick up when I broke seven small loaves of bread for those 4,000 people?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">&amp;apos;Don't you know what I am talking about by now?&amp;apos; Jesus asked.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">As Jesus and his disciples were going into Bethsaida, some people brought a blind man to him and begged him to touch the man.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">Jesus took him by the hand and led him out of the village, where he spit into the man's eyes. He placed his hands on the blind man and asked him if he could see anything.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">The man looked up and said, &amp;apos;I see people, but they look like trees walking around.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">Once again Jesus placed his hands on the man's eyes, and this time the man stared. His eyes were healed, and he saw everything clearly.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">Jesus said to him, &amp;apos;You may return home now, but don't go into the village.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">Jesus and his disciples went to the villages near the town of Caesarea Philippi. As they were walking along, he asked them, &amp;apos;What do people say about me?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">The disciples answered, &amp;apos;Some say you are John the Baptist or maybe Elijah. Others say you are one of the prophets.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">Then Jesus asked, &amp;apos;But who do you say I am?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">Jesus warned the disciples not to tell anyone about him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">Jesus began telling his disciples what would happen to him. He said, &amp;apos;The nation's leaders, the chief priests, and the teachers of the Law of Moses will make the Son of Man suffer terribly. He will be rejected and killed, but three days later he will rise to life.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">Then Jesus explained clearly what he meant.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">But when Jesus turned and saw the disciples, he corrected Peter. He said to him, &amp;apos;Satan, get away from me! You are thinking like everyone else and not like God.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">Jesus then told the crowd and the disciples to come closer, and he said:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">If you want to save your life, you will destroy it. But if you give up your life for me and for the good news, you will save it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">What will you gain, if you own the whole world but destroy yourself?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">What could you give to get back your soul?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">Don't be ashamed of me and my message among these unfaithful and sinful people! If you are, the Son of Man will be ashamed of you when he comes in the glory of his Father with the holy angels.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="9">
			<VERS vnumber="1">I can assure you that some of the people standing here will not die before they see God's kingdom come with power. The man answered, &amp;apos;Ever since he was a child. Don't stop him! No one who works miracles in my name will soon turn and say something bad about me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Six days later Jesus took Peter, James, and John with him. They went up on a high mountain, where they could be alone. There in front of the disciples, Jesus was completely changed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">And his clothes became much whiter than any bleach on earth could make them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Then Elijah and Moses appeared and were talking with Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Peter said to Jesus, &amp;apos;Teacher, it is good for us to be here! Let us make three shelters, one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">But Peter and the others were terribly frightened, and he did not know what he was talking about.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">The shadow of a cloud passed over and covered them. From the cloud a voice said, &amp;apos;This is my Son, and I love him. Listen to what he says!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">At once the disciples looked around, but they saw only Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">As Jesus and his disciples were coming down the mountain, he told them not to say a word about what they had seen, until the Son of Man had been raised from death.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">So they kept it to themselves. But they wondered what he meant by the words &amp;apos;raised from death.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">The disciples asked Jesus, &amp;apos;Don't the teachers of the Law of Moses say that Elijah must come before the Messiah does?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Jesus answered: Elijah certainly will come to get everything ready. But don't the Scriptures also say that the Son of Man must suffer terribly and be rejected?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">I can assure you that Elijah has already come. And people treated him just as they wanted to, as the Scriptures say they would.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">When Jesus and his three disciples came back down, they saw a large crowd around the other disciples. The teachers of the Law of Moses were arguing with them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">The crowd was really surprised to see Jesus, and everyone hurried over to greet him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Jesus asked, &amp;apos;What are you arguing about?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Someone from the crowd answered, &amp;apos;Teacher, I brought my son to you. A demon keeps him from talking.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Whenever the demon attacks my son, it throws him to the ground and makes him foam at the mouth and grit his teeth in pain. Then he becomes stiff. I asked your disciples to force out the demon, but they couldn't do it.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Jesus said, &amp;apos;You people don't have any faith! How much longer must I be with you? Why do I have to put up with you? Bring the boy to me.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">They brought the boy, and as soon as the demon saw Jesus, it made the boy shake all over. He fell down and began rolling on the ground and foaming at the mouth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Jesus asked the boy's father, &amp;apos;How long has he been like this?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">The demon has often tried to kill him by throwing him into a fire or into water. Please have pity and help us if you can!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">Jesus replied, &amp;apos;Why do you say &amp;quot;if you can&amp;quot;? Anything is possible for someone who has faith!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">At once the boy's father shouted, &amp;apos;I do have faith! Please help me to have even more.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">When Jesus saw that a crowd was gathering fast, he spoke sternly to the evil spirit that had kept the boy from speaking or hearing. He said, &amp;apos;I order you to come out of the boy! Don't ever bother him again.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">The spirit screamed and made the boy shake all over. Then it went out of him. The boy looked dead, and almost everyone said he was.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">But Jesus took hold of his hand and helped him stand up.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">After Jesus and the disciples had gone back home and were alone, they asked him, &amp;apos;Why couldn't we force out that demon?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">Jesus answered, &amp;apos;Only prayer can force out this kind of demon.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">Jesus left with his disciples and started through Galilee. He did not want anyone to know about it,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">because he was teaching the disciples that the Son of Man would be handed over to people who would kill him. But three days later he would rise to life.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">The disciples did not understand what Jesus meant, and they were afraid to ask.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">Jesus and his disciples went to his home in Capernaum. After they were inside the house, Jesus asked them, &amp;apos;What were you arguing about along the way?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">They had been arguing about which one of them was the greatest, and so they did not answer.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">After Jesus sat down and told the twelve disciples to gather around him, he said, &amp;apos;If you want the place of honor, you must become a slave and serve others!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">Then Jesus asked a child to stand near him. He put his arm around the child and said,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">&amp;apos;When you welcome even a child because of me, you welcome me. And when you welcome me, you welcome the one who sent me.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">John said, &amp;apos;Teacher, we saw a man using your name to force demons out of people. But he wasn't one of us, and we told him to stop.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">Jesus said to his disciples:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">Anyone who isn't against us is for us.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">And anyone who gives you a cup of water in my name, just because you belong to me, will surely be rewarded.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">It will be terrible for people who cause even one of my little followers to sin. Those people would be better off thrown into the ocean with a heavy stone tied around their necks.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="47">If your eye causes you to sin, get rid of it. You would be better off to go into God's kingdom with only one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into hell.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="48">The worms there never die, and the fire never stops burning.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="49">Everyone must be salted with fire.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="50">Salt is good. But if it no longer tastes like salt, how can it be made salty again? Have salt among you and live at peace with each other.</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="10">
			<VERS vnumber="1">After Jesus left, he went to Judea and then on to the other side of the Jordan River. Once again large crowds came to him, and as usual, he taught them. You can be sure that anyone who gives up home or brothers or sisters or mother or father or children or land for me and for the good news Then Jesus replied, &amp;apos;You certainly will drink from the cup from which I must drink. And you will be baptized just as I must! You know that those foreigners who call themselves kings like to order their people around. And their great leaders have full power over the people they rule. They called out to the blind man and said, &amp;apos;Don't be afraid! Come on! He is calling for you.&amp;apos; At once the man could see, and he went down the road with Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Some Pharisees wanted to test Jesus. So they came up to him and asked if it was right for a man to divorce his wife.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Jesus asked them, &amp;apos;What does the Law of Moses say about this?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">They answered, &amp;apos;Moses allows a man to write out divorce papers and send his wife away.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Jesus replied, &amp;apos;Moses gave you this law because you are so heartless.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">But in the beginning God made a man and a woman.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">That's why a man leaves his father and mother and gets married.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">He becomes like one person with his wife. Then they are no longer two people, but one.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">And no one should separate a couple that God has joined together.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">When Jesus and his disciples were back in the house, they asked him about what he had said.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">He told them, &amp;apos;A man who divorces his wife and marries someone else is unfaithful to his wife.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">A woman who divorces her husband and marries again is also unfaithful.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Some people brought their children to Jesus so he could bless them by placing his hands on them. But his disciples told the people to stop bothering him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">When Jesus saw this, he became angry and said, &amp;apos;Let the children come to me! Don't try to stop them. People who are like these little children belong to the kingdom of God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">I promise you that you cannot get into God's kingdom, unless you accept it the way a child does.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Then Jesus took the children in his arms and blessed them by placing his hands on them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">As Jesus was walking down a road, a man ran up to him. He knelt down, and asked, &amp;apos;Good teacher, what can I do to have eternal life?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Jesus replied, &amp;apos;Why do you call me good? Only God is good.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">You know the commandments. &amp;quot;Do not murder. Be faithful in marriage. Do not steal. Do not tell lies about others. Do not cheat. Respect your father and mother.&amp;quot; &amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">The man answered, &amp;apos;Teacher, I have obeyed all these commandments since I was a young man.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Jesus looked closely at the man. He liked him and said, &amp;apos;There's one thing you still need to do. Go sell everything you own. Give the money to the poor, and you will have riches in heaven. Then come with me.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">When the man heard Jesus say this, he went away gloomy and sad because he was very rich.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">Jesus looked around and said to his disciples, &amp;apos;It's hard for rich people to get into God's kingdom!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">The disciples were shocked to hear this. So Jesus told them again, &amp;apos;It's terribly hard to get into God's kingdom!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">In fact, it's easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to get into God's kingdom.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">Jesus' disciples were even more amazed. They asked each other, &amp;apos;How can anyone ever be saved?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">Jesus looked at them and said, &amp;apos;There are some things that people cannot do, but God can do anything.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">Peter replied, &amp;apos;Remember, we left everything to be your followers!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">Jesus told him:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">will be rewarded. In this world they will be given 100 times as many houses and brothers and sisters and mothers and children and pieces of land, though they will also be mistreated. And in the world to come, they will have eternal life.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">But many who are now first will be last, and many who are now last will be first.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">The disciples were confused as Jesus led them toward Jerusalem, and his other followers were afraid. Once again, Jesus took the twelve disciples aside and told them what was going to happen to him. He said:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">We are now on our way to Jerusalem where the Son of Man will be handed over to the chief priests and the teachers of the Law of Moses. They will sentence him to death and hand him over to foreigners,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">who will make fun of him and spit on him. They will beat him and kill him. But three days later he will rise to life.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">James and John, the sons of Zebedee, came up to Jesus and asked, &amp;apos;Teacher, will you do us a favor?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">Jesus asked them what they wanted,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">and they answered, &amp;apos;When you come into your glory, please let one of us sit at your right side and the other at your left.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">Jesus told them, &amp;apos;You don't really know what you're asking! Are you able to drink from the cup that I must soon drink from or be baptized as I must be baptized?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">&amp;apos;Yes, we are!&amp;apos; James and John answered.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">But it isn't for me to say who will sit at my right side and at my left. This is for God to decide.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">When the ten other disciples heard this, they were angry with James and John.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">But Jesus called the disciples together and said:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43">But don't act like them. If you want to be great, you must be the servant of all the others.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44">And if you want to be first, you must be everyone's slave.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45">The Son of Man did not come to be a slave master, but a slave who will give his life to rescue many people.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46">Jesus and his disciples went to Jericho. And as they were leaving, they were followed by a large crowd. A blind beggar by the name of Bartimaeus son of Timaeus was sitting beside the road.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="47">When he heard that it was Jesus from Nazareth, he shouted, &amp;apos;Jesus, Son of David, have pity on me!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="48">Many people told the man to stop, but he shouted even louder, &amp;apos;Son of David, have pity on me!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="49">Jesus stopped and said, &amp;apos;Call him over!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="50">The man threw off his coat as he jumped up and ran to Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="51">Jesus asked, &amp;apos;What do you want me to do for you?&amp;apos; The blind man answered, &amp;apos;Master, I want to see!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="52">Jesus told him, &amp;apos;You may go. Your eyes are healed because of your faith.&amp;apos;</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="11">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Jesus and his disciples reached Bethphage and Bethany near the Mount of Olives. When they were getting close to Jerusalem, Jesus sent two of them on ahead.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">He told them, &amp;apos;Go into the next village. As soon as you enter it, you will find a young donkey that has never been ridden. Untie the donkey and bring it here.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">If anyone asks why you are doing this, say, &amp;quot;The Lord needs it and will soon bring it back.&amp;quot; &amp;apos; God bless the one who comes in the name of the Lord! of our ancestor David. Hooray for God in heaven above!&amp;apos; Have faith in God! They were afraid of the crowd Jesus replied, &amp;apos;Then I won't tell you who gave me the right to do what I do.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">The disciples left and found the donkey tied near a door that faced the street. While they were untying it,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">some of the people standing there asked, &amp;apos;Why are you untying the donkey?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">They told them what Jesus had said, and the people let them take it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">The disciples led the donkey to Jesus. They put some of their clothes on its back, and Jesus got on.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Many people spread clothes on the road, while others spread branches they had cut from the fields.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">In front of Jesus and behind him, people went along shouting, &amp;apos;Hooray!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">God bless the coming kingdom</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">After Jesus had gone to Jerusalem, he went into the temple and looked around at everything. But since it was already late in the day, he went back to Bethany with the twelve disciples.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">When Jesus and his disciples left Bethany the next morning, he was hungry.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">From a distance Jesus saw a fig tree covered with leaves, and he went to see if there were any figs on the tree. But there were none, because it wasn't the season for figs.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">So Jesus said to the tree, &amp;apos;Never again will anyone eat fruit from this tree!&amp;apos; The disciples heard him say this.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">After Jesus and his disciples reached Jerusalem, he went into the temple and began chasing out everyone who was selling and buying. He turned over the tables of the moneychangers and the benches of those who were selling doves.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Jesus would not let anyone carry things through the temple.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Then he taught the people and said, &amp;apos;The Scriptures say, &amp;quot;My house should be called a place of worship for all nations.&amp;quot; But you have made it a place where robbers hide!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">The chief priests and the teachers of the Law of Moses heard what Jesus said, and they started looking for a way to kill him. They were afraid of him, because the crowds were completely amazed at his teaching.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">That evening, Jesus and the disciples went outside the city.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">As the disciples walked past the fig tree the next morning, they noticed that it was completely dried up, roots and all.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Peter remembered what Jesus had said to the tree. Then Peter said, &amp;apos;Teacher, look! The tree you put a curse on has dried up.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Jesus told his disciples:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">If you have faith in God and don't doubt, you can tell this mountain to get up and jump into the sea, and it will.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">Everything you ask for in prayer will be yours, if you only have faith.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">Jesus and his disciples returned to Jerusalem. And as he was walking through the temple, the chief priests, the nation's leaders, and the teachers of the Law of Moses came over to him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">They asked, &amp;apos;What right do you have to do these things? Who gave you this authority?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">Jesus answered, &amp;apos;I have just one question to ask you. If you answer it, I will tell you where I got the right to do these things.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">Who gave John the right to baptize? Was it God in heaven or merely some human being?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">They thought it over and said to each other, &amp;apos;We can't say that God gave John this right. Jesus will ask us why we didn't believe John.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">On the other hand, these people think that John was a prophet. So we can't say it was merely some human who gave John the right to baptize.&amp;apos;</VERS>

		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="12">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Jesus then told them this story: A farmer once planted a vineyard. He built a wall around it and dug a pit to crush the grapes in. He also built a lookout tower. Then he rented out his vineyard and left the country. &amp;quot;The stone the builders tossed aside is now the most important stone of all. the Lord has done, and it is amazing to us.&amp;quot; &amp;apos; &amp;apos;The Emperor's,&amp;apos; they answered. You are completely wrong! You don't know what the Scriptures teach. And you don't know anything about the power of God. &amp;quot;The Lord said to my Lord: until I make your enemies into a footstool for you.&amp;quot; The large crowd enjoyed listening to Jesus teach. Guard against the teachers of the Law of Moses! They love to walk around in long robes and be greeted in the market. I tell you that this poor widow has put in more than all the others.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">When it was harvest time, he sent a servant to get his share of the grapes.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">The renters grabbed the servant, beat him up, and sent him away without a thing.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">The owner sent another servant, but the renters beat him on the head and insulted him terribly.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Then the man sent another servant, and they killed him. He kept sending servant after servant. They beat some of them and killed some.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">The owner had a son he loved very much. Finally, he sent his son to the renters because he thought they would respect him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">But they said to themselves, &amp;apos;Someday he will own this vineyard. Let's kill him! That way we can have it all for ourselves.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">So they grabbed the owner's son, killed him, and threw his body out of the vineyard.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Jesus asked, &amp;apos;What do you think the owner of the vineyard will do? He will come and kill those renters and let someone else have his vineyard.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">You surely know that the Scriptures say,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">This is something</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">The leaders knew that Jesus was really talking about them, and they wanted to arrest him. But because they were afraid of the crowd, they let him alone and left.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">The Pharisees got together with Herod's followers. Then they sent some men to trick Jesus into saying something wrong.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">They went to him and said, &amp;apos;Teacher, we know that you are honest. You treat everyone with the same respect, no matter who they are. And you teach the truth about what God wants people to do. Tell us, should we pay taxes to the Emperor or not?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Jesus knew what they were up to, and he said, &amp;apos;Why are you trying to test me? Show me a coin!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">They brought him a silver coin, and he asked, &amp;apos;Whose picture and name are on it?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Then Jesus told them, &amp;apos;Give the Emperor what belongs to him and give God what belongs to God.&amp;apos; The men were amazed at Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">The Sadducees did not believe that people would rise to life after death. So some of them came to Jesus and said:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Teacher, Moses wrote that if a married man dies and has no children, his brother should marry the widow. Their first son would then be thought of as the son of the dead brother.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">There were once seven brothers. The first one married, but died without having any children.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">The second brother married his brother's widow, and he also died without having children. The same thing happened to the third brother,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">and finally to all seven brothers. At last the woman died.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">When God raises people from death, whose wife will this woman be? After all, she had been married to all seven brothers.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">Jesus answered:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">When God raises people to life, they won't marry. They will be like the angels in heaven.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">You surely know about people being raised to life. You know that in the story about Moses and the burning bush, God said, &amp;apos;I am the God worshiped by Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">He isn't the God of the dead, but of the living. You Sadducees are all wrong.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">One of the teachers of the Law of Moses came up while Jesus and the Sadducees were arguing. When he heard Jesus give a good answer, he asked him, &amp;apos;What is the most important commandment?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">Jesus answered, &amp;apos;The most important one says: &amp;quot;People of Israel, you have only one Lord and God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">You must love him with all your heart, soul, mind, and strength.&amp;quot;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">The second most important commandment says: &amp;quot;Love others as much as you love yourself.&amp;quot; No other commandment is more important than these.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">The man replied, &amp;apos;Teacher, you are certainly right to say there is only one God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">It is also true that we must love God with all our heart, mind, and strength, and that we must love others as much as we love ourselves. These commandments are more important than all the sacrifices and offerings that we could possibly make.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">When Jesus saw that the man had given a sensible answer, he told him, &amp;apos;You are not far from God's kingdom.&amp;apos; After this, no one dared ask Jesus any more questions.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">As Jesus was teaching in the temple, he said, &amp;apos;How can the teachers of the Law of Moses say the Messiah will come from the family of King David?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">The Holy Spirit led David to say, Sit at my right side</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">If David called the Messiah his Lord, how can the Messiah be his son?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">As Jesus was teaching, he said:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">They like the front seats in the synagogues and the best seats at banquets.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">But they cheat widows out of their homes and pray long prayers just to show off. They will be punished most of all.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">Jesus was sitting in the temple near the offering box and watching people put in their gifts. He noticed that many rich people were giving a lot of money.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">Finally, a poor widow came up and put in two coins worth only a few pennies.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43">Jesus told his disciples to gather around him. Then he said:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44">Everyone else gave what they didn't need. But she is very poor and gave everything she had. Now she doesn't have a cent to live on.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1">As Jesus was leaving the temple, one of his disciples said to him, &amp;apos;Teacher, look at these beautiful stones and wonderful buildings!&amp;apos; Watch out and don't let anyone fool you! &amp;apos;The sun will become dark, and the moon will no longer shine. will be shaken.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Jesus replied, &amp;apos;Do you see these huge buildings? They will certainly be torn down! Not one stone will be left in place.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Later, as Jesus was sitting on the Mount of Olives across from the temple, Peter, James, John, and Andrew came to him in private.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">They asked, &amp;apos;When will these things happen? What will be the sign that they are about to take place?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Jesus answered:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Many will come and claim to be me. They will use my name and fool many people.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">When you hear about wars and threats of wars, don't be afraid. These things will have to happen first, but that isn't the end.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Nations and kingdoms will go to war against each other. There will be earthquakes in many places, and people will starve to death. But this is just the beginning of troubles.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Be on your guard! You will be taken to courts and beaten with whips in their synagogues. And because of me, you will have to stand before rulers and kings to tell about your faith.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">But before the end comes, the good news must be preached to all nations.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">When you are arrested, don't worry about what you will say. You will be given the right words when the time comes. But you will not really be the ones speaking. Your words will come from the Holy Spirit.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Brothers and sisters will betray each other and have each other put to death. Parents will betray their own children, and children will turn against their parents and have them killed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Everyone will hate you because of me. But if you keep on being faithful right to the end, you will be saved.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Someday you will see that &amp;apos;Horrible Thing&amp;apos; where it should not be. Everyone who reads this must try to understand! If you are living in Judea at that time, run to the mountains.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">If you are on the roof of your house, don't go inside to get anything.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">If you are out in the field, don't go back for your coat.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">It will be an awful time for women who are expecting babies or nursing young children.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Pray that it won't happen in winter.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">This will be the worst time of suffering since God created the world, and nothing this terrible will ever happen again.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">If the Lord doesn't make the time shorter, no one will be left alive. But because of his chosen and special ones, he will make the time shorter.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">If someone should say, &amp;apos;Here is the Messiah!&amp;apos; or &amp;apos;There he is!&amp;apos; don't believe it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">False messiahs and false prophets will come and work miracles and signs. They will even try to fool God's chosen ones.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">But be on your guard! That's why I am telling you these things now.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">In those days, right after this time of suffering,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">The stars will fall, and the powers in the sky</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">Then the Son of Man will be seen coming in the clouds with great power and glory.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">He will send his angels to gather his chosen ones from all over the earth.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="33">So watch out and be ready! You don't know when the time will come.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">It is like what happens when a man goes away for a while and places his servants in charge of everything. He tells each of them what to do, and he orders the guard to keep alert.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">So be alert! You don't know when the master of the house will come back. It could be in the evening or at midnight or before dawn or in the morning.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1">It was now two days before Passover and the Festival of Thin Bread. The chief priests and the teachers of the Law of Moses were planning how they could sneak around and have Jesus arrested and put to death.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">They were saying, &amp;apos;We must not do it during the festival, because the people will riot.&amp;apos; Leave her alone! Why are you bothering her? She has done a beautiful thing for me. &amp;quot;I will strike down the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered.&amp;quot; All the others said the same thing. &amp;apos;Soon you will see the Son of Man of God All-Powerful, and coming with the clouds of heaven.&amp;apos; A little while later some of the people said to Peter, &amp;apos;You certainly are one of them. You're a Galilean!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Jesus was eating in Bethany at the home of Simon, who once had leprosy, when a woman came in with a very expensive bottle of sweet-smelling perfume. After breaking it open, she poured the perfume on Jesus' head.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">This made some of the guests angry, and they complained, &amp;apos;Why such a waste?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">We could have sold this perfume for more than 300 silver coins and given the money to the poor!&amp;apos; So they started saying cruel things to the woman.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">But Jesus said:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">You will always have the poor with you. And whenever you want to, you can give to them. But you won't always have me here with you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">She has done all she could by pouring perfume on my body to prepare it for burial.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">You may be sure that wherever the good news is told all over the world, people will remember what she has done. And they will tell others.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Judas Iscariot was one of the twelve disciples. He went to the chief priests and offered to help them arrest Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">They were glad to hear this, and they promised to pay him. So Judas started looking for a good chance to betray Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">It was the first day of the Festival of Thin Bread, and the Passover lambs were being killed. Jesus' disciples asked him, &amp;apos;Where do you want us to prepare the Passover meal?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Jesus said to two of the disciples, &amp;apos;Go into the city, where you will meet a man carrying a jar of water. Follow him,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">and when he goes into a house, say to the owner, &amp;quot;Our teacher wants to know if you have a room where he can eat the Passover meal with his disciples.&amp;quot;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">The owner will take you upstairs and show you a large room furnished and ready for you to use. Prepare the meal there.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">The two disciples went into the city and found everything just as Jesus had told them. So they prepared the Passover meal.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">This made the disciples sad, and one after another they said to Jesus, &amp;apos;You surely don't mean me!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">He answered, &amp;apos;It is one of you twelve men who is eating from this dish with me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">The Son of Man will die, just as the Scriptures say. But it is going to be terrible for the one who betrays me. That man would be better off if he had never been born.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">During the meal Jesus took some bread in his hands. He blessed the bread and broke it. Then he gave it to his disciples and said, &amp;apos;Take this. It is my body.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">Jesus picked up a cup of wine and gave thanks to God. He gave it to his disciples, and they all drank some.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">Then he said, &amp;apos;This is my blood, which is poured out for many people, and with it God makes his agreement.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">From now on I will not drink any wine, until I drink new wine in God's kingdom.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">Then they sang a hymn and went out to the Mount of Olives.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">Jesus said to his disciples, &amp;apos;All of you will reject me, as the Scriptures say,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">But after I am raised to life, I will go ahead of you to Galilee.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">Peter spoke up, &amp;apos;Even if all the others reject you, I never will!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">Jesus replied, &amp;apos;This very night before a rooster crows twice, you will say three times that you don't know me.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">But Peter was so sure of himself that he said, &amp;apos;Even if I have to die with you, I will never say I don't know you!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">Jesus went with his disciples to a place called Gethsemane, and he told them, &amp;apos;Sit here while I pray.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">Jesus took along Peter, James, and John. He was sad and troubled and</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">told them, &amp;apos;I am so sad that I feel as if I am dying. Stay here and keep awake with me.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">When Jesus came back and found the disciples sleeping, he said to Simon Peter, &amp;apos;Are you asleep? Can't you stay awake for just one hour?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">Stay awake and pray that you won't be tested. You want to do what is right, but you are weak.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">Jesus went back and prayed the same prayer.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">But when he returned to the disciples, he found them sleeping again. They simply could not keep their eyes open, and they did not know what to say.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">When Jesus returned to the disciples the third time, he said, &amp;apos;Are you still sleeping and resting? Enough of this! The time has come for the Son of Man to be handed over to sinners.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">Get up! Let's go. The one who will betray me is already here.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43">Jesus was still speaking, when Judas the betrayer came up. He was one of the twelve disciples, and a mob of men armed with swords and clubs were with him. They had been sent by the chief priests, the nation's leaders, and the teachers of the Law of Moses.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44">Judas had told them ahead of time, &amp;apos;Arrest the man I greet with a kiss. Tie him up tight and lead him away.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45">Judas walked right up to Jesus and said, &amp;apos;Teacher!&amp;apos; Then Judas kissed him,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46">and the men grabbed Jesus and arrested him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="47">Someone standing there pulled out a sword. He struck the servant of the high priest and cut off his ear.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="48">Jesus said to the mob, &amp;apos;Why do you come with swords and clubs to arrest me like a criminal?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="49">Day after day I was with you and taught in the temple, and you didn't arrest me. But what the Scriptures say must come true.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="50">All of Jesus' disciples ran off and left him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="51">One of them was a young man who was wearing only a linen cloth. And when the men grabbed him,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="52">he left the cloth behind and ran away naked.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="53">Jesus was led off to the high priest. Then the chief priests, the nation's leaders, and the teachers of the Law of Moses all met together.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="54">Peter had followed at a distance, and when he reached the courtyard of the high priest's house, he sat down with the guards to warm himself beside a fire.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="55">The chief priests and the whole council tried to find someone to accuse Jesus of a crime, so they could put him to death. But they could not find anyone to accuse him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="56">Many people did tell lies against Jesus, but they did not agree on what they said.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="57">Finally, some men stood up and lied about him. They said,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="58">&amp;apos;We heard him say he would tear down this temple that we built. He also claimed that in three days he would build another one without any help.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="59">But even then they did not agree on what they said.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="60">The high priest stood up in the council and asked Jesus, &amp;apos;Why don't you say something in your own defense? Don't you hear the charges they are making against you?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="61">But Jesus kept quiet and did not say a word. The high priest asked him another question, &amp;apos;Are you the Messiah, the Son of the glorious God?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="62">&amp;apos;Yes, I am!&amp;apos; Jesus answered. sitting at the right side</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="63">At once the high priest ripped his robe apart and shouted, &amp;apos;Why do we need more witnesses?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="64">You heard him claim to be God! What is your decision?&amp;apos; They all agreed he should be put to death.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="65">Some of the people started spitting on Jesus. They blindfolded him, hit him with their fists, and said, &amp;apos;Tell us who hit you!&amp;apos; Then the guards took charge of Jesus and beat him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="66">While Peter was still in the courtyard, a servant girl of the high priest came up</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="67">and saw Peter warming himself by the fire. She stared at him and said, &amp;apos;You were with Jesus from Nazareth!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="68">Peter replied, &amp;apos;That isn't true! I don't know what you're talking about. I don't have any idea what you mean.&amp;apos; He went out to the gate, and a rooster crowed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="69">The servant girl saw Peter again and said to the people standing there, &amp;apos;This man is one of them!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="70">&amp;apos;No, I'm not!&amp;apos; Peter replied.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="71">This time Peter began to curse and swear, &amp;apos;I don't even know the man you're talking about!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="72">At once the rooster crowed a second time. Then Peter remembered that Jesus had told him, &amp;apos;Before a rooster crows twice, you will say three times that you don't know me.&amp;apos; So Peter started crying.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1">Early the next morning the chief priests, the nation's leaders, and the teachers of the Law of Moses met together with the whole Jewish council. They tied up Jesus and led him off to Pilate. &amp;apos;Those are your words,&amp;apos; Jesus answered. &amp;apos;Nail him to a cross!&amp;apos; they yelled even louder.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">He asked Jesus, &amp;apos;Are you the king of the Jews?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">The chief priests brought many charges against Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Then Pilate questioned him again, &amp;apos;Don't you have anything to say? Don't you hear what crimes they say you have done?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">But Jesus did not answer, and Pilate was amazed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">During Passover, Pilate always freed one prisoner chosen by the people.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">And at that time there was a prisoner named Barabbas. He and some others had been arrested for murder during a riot.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">The crowd now came and asked Pilate to set a prisoner free, just as he usually did.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Pilate asked them, &amp;apos;Do you want me to free the king of the Jews?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Pilate knew that the chief priests had brought Jesus to him because they were jealous.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">But the chief priests told the crowd to ask Pilate to free Barabbas.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Then Pilate asked the crowd, &amp;apos;What do you want me to do with this man you say is the king of the Jews?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">They yelled, &amp;apos;Nail him to a cross!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Pilate asked, &amp;apos;But what crime has he done?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Pilate wanted to please the crowd, so he set Barabbas free. Then he ordered his soldiers to beat Jesus with a whip and nail him to a cross.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">The soldiers led Jesus inside the courtyard of the fortress and called together the rest of the troops.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">They put a purple robe on him, and on his head they placed a crown they had made out of thorn branches.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">They made fun of Jesus and shouted, &amp;apos;Hey, you king of the Jews!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Then they beat him on the head with a stick. They spit on him and knelt down and pretended to worship him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">When the soldiers had finished making fun of Jesus, they took off the purple robe. They put his own clothes back on him and led him off to be nailed to a cross.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Simon from Cyrene happened to be coming in from a farm, and they forced him to carry Jesus' cross. Simon was the father of Alexander and Rufus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">The soldiers took Jesus to Golgotha, which means &amp;apos;Place of a Skull.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">There they gave him some wine mixed with a drug to ease the pain, but he refused to drink it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">They nailed Jesus to a cross and gambled to see who would get his clothes.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">It was about nine o'clock in the morning when they nailed him to the cross.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">On it was a sign that told why he was nailed there. It read, &amp;apos;This is the King of the Jews.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">People who passed by said terrible things about Jesus. They shook their heads and shouted, &amp;apos;Ha! So you're the one who claimed you could tear down the temple and build it again in three days.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">Save yourself and come down from the cross!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">The chief priests and the teachers of the Law of Moses also made fun of Jesus. They said to each other, &amp;apos;He saved others, but he can't save himself.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">If he is the Messiah, the king of Israel, let him come down from the cross! Then we will see and believe.&amp;apos; The two criminals also said cruel things to Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">About noon the sky turned dark and stayed that way until around three o'clock.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">Then about that time Jesus shouted, &amp;apos;Eloi, Eloi, lema sabachthani?&amp;apos; which means, &amp;apos;My God, my God, why have you deserted me?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">Some of the people standing there heard Jesus and said, &amp;apos;He is calling for Elijah.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">One of them ran and grabbed a sponge. After he had soaked it in wine, he put it on a stick and held it up to Jesus. He said, &amp;apos;Let's wait and see if Elijah will come and take him down!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">Jesus shouted and then died.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">At once the curtain in the temple tore in two from top to bottom.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="43">A man named Joseph from Arimathea was brave enough to ask Pilate for the body of Jesus. Joseph was a highly respected member of the Jewish council, and he was also waiting for God's kingdom to come.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="45">After the officer told him, Pilate let Joseph have Jesus' body.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46">Joseph bought a linen cloth and took the body down from the cross. He had it wrapped in the cloth, and he put it in a tomb that had been cut into solid rock. Then he rolled a big stone against the entrance to the tomb.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="47">Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joseph were watching and saw where the body was placed.</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="16">
			<VERS vnumber="1">After the Sabbath, Mary Magdalene, Salome, and Mary the mother of James bought some spices to put on Jesus' body.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="4">But when they looked, they saw that the stone had already been rolled away. And it was a huge stone! Go and preach the good news to everyone in the world.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">The women went into the tomb, and on the right side they saw a young man in a white robe sitting there. They were alarmed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">The man said, &amp;apos;Don't be alarmed! You are looking for Jesus from Nazareth, who was nailed to a cross. God has raised him to life, and he isn't here. You can see the place where they put his body.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Now go and tell his disciples, and especially Peter, that he will go ahead of you to Galilee. You will see him there, just as he told you.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">When the women ran from the tomb, they were confused and shaking all over. They were too afraid to tell anyone what had happened.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Very early on the first day of the week, after Jesus had risen to life, he appeared to Mary Magdalene. Earlier he had forced seven demons out of her.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">She left and told his friends, who were crying and mourning.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Even though they heard that Jesus was alive and that Mary had seen him, they still would not believe it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Later, Jesus appeared in another form to two disciples, as they were on their way out of the city.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">But when these disciples told what had happened, the others would not believe either.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Afterwards, Jesus appeared to his eleven disciples as they were eating. He scolded them because they were too stubborn to believe the ones who had seen him after he had been raised to life.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Then he told them:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Anyone who believes me and is baptized will be saved. But anyone who refuses to believe me will be condemned.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Everyone who believes me will be able to do wonderful things. By using my name they will force out demons, and they will speak new languages.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">They will handle snakes and will drink poison and not be hurt. They will also heal sick people by placing their hands on them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">After the Lord Jesus had said these things to the disciples, he was taken back up to heaven where he sat down at the right side of God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Then the disciples left and preached everywhere. The Lord was with them, and the miracles they worked proved that their message was true.</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="1">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Many people have tried to tell the story of what God has done among us.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">They wrote what we had been told by the ones who were there in the beginning and saw what happened.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">So I made a careful study of everything and then decided to write and tell you exactly what took place. Honorable Theophilus,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">I have done this to let you know the truth about what you have heard. Don't be afraid, Zechariah! God has heard your prayers. Your wife Elizabeth will have a son, and you must name him John. The Holy Spirit came upon Elizabeth. God has blessed you more than any other woman! He has also blessed the child you will have.

You will go ahead of the Lord to get everything ready for him. that they can be saved when their sins are forgiven. will shine upon us like the sun that rises in the dark shadow of death this light will shine to guide us into a life of peace.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">When Herod was king of Judea, there was a priest by the name of Zechariah from the priestly group of Abijah. His wife Elizabeth was from the family of Aaron.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Both of them were good people and pleased the Lord God by obeying all that he had commanded.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">But they did not have children. Elizabeth could not have any, and both Zechariah and Elizabeth were already old.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">One day Zechariah's group of priests were on duty, and he was serving God as a priest.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">According to the custom of the priests, he had been chosen to go into the Lord's temple that day and to burn incense,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">while the people stood outside praying.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">All at once an angel from the Lord appeared to Zechariah at the right side of the altar.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Zechariah was confused and afraid when he saw the angel.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">But the angel told him:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">His birth will make you very happy, and many people will be glad.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Your son will be a great servant of the Lord. He must never drink wine or beer, and the power of the Holy Spirit will be with him from the time he is born.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">John will lead many people in Israel to turn back to the Lord their God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">He will go ahead of the Lord with the same power and spirit that Elijah had. And because of John, parents will be more thoughtful of their children. And people who now disobey God will begin to think as they ought to. This is how John will get people ready for the Lord.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Zechariah said to the angel, &amp;apos;How will I know this is going to happen? My wife and I are both very old.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">The angel answered, &amp;apos;I am Gabriel, God's servant, and I was sent to tell you this good news.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">You have not believed what I have said. So you will not be able to say a thing until all this happens. But everything will take place when it is supposed to.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">The crowd was waiting for Zechariah and kept wondering why he was staying in the temple so long.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">When he did come out, he could not speak, and they knew he had seen a vision. He motioned to them with his hands, but did not say a thing.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">When Zechariah's time of service in the temple was over, he went home.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">Soon after this, his wife was expecting a baby, and for five months she did not leave the house. She said to herself,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">&amp;apos;What the Lord has done for me will keep people from looking down on me.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">One month later God sent the angel Gabriel to the town of Nazareth in Galilee</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">with a message for a virgin named Mary. She was engaged to Joseph from the family of King David.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">The angel greeted Mary and said, &amp;apos;You are truly blessed! The Lord is with you.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">Mary was confused by the angel's words and wondered what they meant.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">Then the angel told Mary, &amp;apos;Don't be afraid! God is pleased with you,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">and you will have a son. His name will be Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">He will be great and will be called the Son of God Most High. The Lord God will make him king, as his ancestor David was.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">He will rule the people of Israel forever, and his kingdom will never end.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">Mary asked the angel, &amp;apos;How can this happen? I am not even married!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">The angel answered, &amp;apos;The Holy Spirit will come down to you, and God's power will come over you. So your child will be called the holy Son of God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">Your relative Elizabeth is also going to have a son, even though she is old. No one thought she could ever have a baby, but in three months she will have a son.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">Nothing is impossible for God!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">Mary said, &amp;apos;I am the Lord's servant! Let it happen as you have said.&amp;apos; And the angel left her.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">A short time later Mary hurried to a town in the hill country of Judea.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">She went into Zechariah's home, where she greeted Elizabeth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">When Elizabeth heard Mary's greeting, her baby moved within her.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">Then in a loud voice she said to Mary:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43">Why should the mother of my Lord come to me?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44">As soon as I heard your greeting, my baby became happy and moved within me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45">The Lord has blessed you because you believed that he will keep his promise.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46">Mary said:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="47">and I am glad</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="48">God cares for me,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="49">God All-Powerful has done</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="50">He always shows mercy</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="51">The Lord has used</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="52">God drags strong rulers</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="53">God gives the hungry</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="54">God helps his servant Israel</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="55">The Lord made this promise</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="56">Mary stayed with Elizabeth about three months. Then she went back home.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="57">When Elizabeth's son was born,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="58">her neighbors and relatives heard how kind the Lord had been to her, and they too were glad.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="59">Eight days later they did for the child what the Law of Moses commands. They were going to name him Zechariah, after his father.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="60">But Elizabeth said, &amp;apos;No! His name is John.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="61">The people argued, &amp;apos;No one in your family has ever been named John.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="62">So they motioned to Zechariah to find out what he wanted to name his son.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="63">Zechariah asked for a writing tablet. Then he wrote, &amp;apos;His name is John.&amp;apos; Everyone was amazed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="64">At once, Zechariah started speaking and praising God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="65">All the neighbors were frightened because of what had happened, and everywhere in the hill country people kept talking about these things.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="66">Everyone who heard about this wondered what this child would grow up to be. They knew the Lord was with him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="67">The Holy Spirit came upon Zechariah, and he began to speak:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="68">Praise the Lord,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="69">Our God has given us a mighty Savior in the sky.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="70">Long ago the Lord promised</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="71">to save us from our enemies</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="72">God said he would be kind</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="73">He told our ancestor Abraham</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="74">that he would rescue us</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="75">by being holy and good</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="76">You, my son, will be called</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="77">You will tell his people</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="78">God's love and kindness</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="79">On us who live</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="80">As John grew up, God's Spirit gave him great power. John lived in the desert until the time he was sent to the people of Israel.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="2">
			<VERS vnumber="1">About that time Emperor Augustus gave orders for the names of all the people to be listed in record books.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">These first records were made when Quirinius was governor of Syria. Peace on earth to everyone who pleases God.&amp;apos; They took Jesus to the temple in Jerusalem and presented him to the Lord, and now I can die in peace, because you have kept your promise to me. what you have done to save your people, will also see this. for all nations, and it will bring honor to your people Israel.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Everyone had to go to their own hometown to be listed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">So Joseph had to leave Nazareth in Galilee and go to Bethlehem in Judea. Long ago Bethlehem had been King David's hometown, and Joseph went there because he was from David's family.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Mary was engaged to Joseph and traveled with him to Bethlehem. She was soon going to have a baby,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">and while they were there,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">she gave birth to her first-born son. She dressed him in baby clothes and laid him on a bed of hay, because there was no room for them in the inn.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">That night in the fields near Bethlehem some shepherds were guarding their sheep.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">All at once an angel came down to them from the Lord, and the brightness of the Lord's glory flashed around them. The shepherds were frightened.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">But the angel said, &amp;apos;Don't be afraid! I have good news for you, which will make everyone happy.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">This very day in King David's hometown a Savior was born for you. He is Christ the Lord.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">You will know who he is, because you will find him dressed in baby clothes and lying on a bed of hay.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Suddenly many other angels came down from heaven and joined in praising God. They said:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">&amp;apos;Praise God in heaven!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">After the angels had left and gone back to heaven, the shepherds said to each other, &amp;apos;Let's go to Bethlehem and see what the Lord has told us about.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">They hurried off and found Mary and Joseph, and they saw the baby lying on a bed of hay.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">When the shepherds saw Jesus, they told his parents what the angel had said about him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Everyone listened and was surprised.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">But Mary kept thinking about all this and wondering what it meant.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">As the shepherds returned to their sheep, they were praising God and saying wonderful things about him. Everything they had seen and heard was just as the angel had said.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Eight days later Jesus' parents did for him what the Law of Moses commands. And they named him Jesus, just as the angel had told Mary when he promised she would have a baby.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">The time came for Mary and Joseph to do what the Law of Moses says a mother is supposed to do after her baby is born.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">just as the Law of the Lord says, &amp;apos;Each first-born baby boy belongs to the Lord.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">The Law of the Lord also says parents have to offer a sacrifice, giving at least a pair of doves or two young pigeons. So that is what Mary and Joseph did.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">At this time a man named Simeon was living in Jerusalem. Simeon was a good man. He loved God and was waiting for him to save the people of Israel. God's Spirit came to him</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">and told him that he would not die until he had seen Christ the Lord.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">When Mary and Joseph brought Jesus to the temple to do what the Law of Moses says should be done for a new baby, the Spirit told Simeon to go into the temple.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">Simeon took the baby Jesus in his arms and praised God,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">&amp;apos;Lord, I am your servant,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">With my own eyes I have seen</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">and foreign nations</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">Your mighty power is a light</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">Jesus' parents were surprised at what Simeon had said.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">Then he blessed them and told Mary, &amp;apos;This child of yours will cause many people in Israel to fall and others to stand. The child will be like a warning sign. Many people will reject him,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">and you, Mary, will suffer as though you had been stabbed by a dagger. But all this will show what people are really thinking.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">The prophet Anna was also there in the temple. She was the daughter of Phanuel from the tribe of Asher, and she was very old. In her youth she had been married for seven years, but her husband died.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">And now she was 84 years old. Night and day she served God in the temple by praying and often going without eating.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">At this time Anna came in and praised God. She spoke about the child Jesus to everyone who hoped for Jerusalem to be set free.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">After Joseph and Mary had done everything that the Law of the Lord commands, they returned home to Nazareth in Galilee.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">The child Jesus grew. He became strong and wise, and God blessed him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">Every year Jesus' parents went to Jerusalem for Passover.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">And when Jesus was twelve years old, they all went there as usual for the celebration.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43">After Passover his parents left, but they did not know that Jesus had stayed on in the city.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44">They thought he was traveling with some other people, and they went a whole day before they started looking for him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45">When they could not find him with their relatives and friends, they went back to Jerusalem and started looking for him there.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46">Three days later they found Jesus sitting in the temple, listening to the teachers and asking them questions.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="47">Everyone who heard him was surprised at how much he knew and at the answers he gave.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="48">When his parents found him, they were amazed. His mother said, &amp;apos;Son, why have you done this to us? Your father and I have been very worried, and we have been searching for you!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="49">Jesus answered, &amp;apos;Why did you have to look for me? Didn't you know that I would be in my Father's house?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="50">But they did not understand what he meant.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="51">Jesus went back to Nazareth with his parents and obeyed them. His mother kept on thinking about all that had happened.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="52">Jesus became wise, and he grew strong. God was pleased with him and so were the people.</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="3">
			<VERS vnumber="1">For 15 years Emperor Tiberius had ruled that part of the world. Pontius Pilate was governor of Judea, and Herod was the ruler of Galilee. Herod's brother, Philip, was the ruler in the countries of Iturea and Trachonitis, and Lysanias was the ruler of Abilene.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Annas and Caiaphas were the Jewish high priests. At that time God spoke to Zechariah's son John, who was living in the desert. &amp;apos;In the desert someone is shouting, &amp;quot;Get the road ready for the Lord! Make a straight path for him. and level every mountain and hill. Straighten the crooked paths and smooth out the rough roads. the saving power of God.&amp;quot; &amp;apos; John told them, &amp;apos;Don't force people to pay money to make you leave them alone. Be satisfied with your pay.&amp;apos; The family of Jesus went all the way back to Adam and then to God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">So John went along the Jordan Valley, telling the people, &amp;apos;Turn back to God and be baptized! Then your sins will be forgiven.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Isaiah the prophet wrote about John when he said,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Fill up every valley</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="9">An ax is ready to cut the trees down at their roots. Any tree that doesn't produce good fruit will be cut down and thrown into a fire.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">The crowds asked John, &amp;apos;What should we do?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">John told them, &amp;apos;If you have two coats, give one to someone who doesn't have any. If you have food, share it with someone else.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">When tax collectors came to be baptized, they asked John, &amp;apos;Teacher, what should we do?&amp;apos;</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="14">Some soldiers asked him, &amp;apos;And what about us? What do we have to do?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Everyone became excited and wondered, &amp;apos;Could John be the Messiah?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">John said, &amp;apos;I am just baptizing with water. But someone more powerful is going to come, and I am not good enough even to untie his sandals. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">His threshing fork is in his hand, and he is ready to separate the wheat from the husks. He will store the wheat in his barn and burn the husks with a fire that never goes out.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">In many different ways John preached the good news to the people.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">But to Herod the ruler, he said, &amp;apos;It was wrong for you to take Herodias, your brother's wife.&amp;apos; John also said Herod had done many other bad things.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1">When Jesus returned from the Jordan River, the power of the Holy Spirit was with him, and the Spirit led him into the desert.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">For 40 days Jesus was tested by the devil, and during that time he went without eating. When it was all over, he was hungry. &amp;quot;Worship the Lord your God and serve only him!&amp;quot; &amp;apos; &amp;quot;God will tell his angels to take care of you. They will catch you in their arms, and you will not even hurt your feet on the stones.&amp;quot; &amp;apos; has come to me, because he has chosen me to tell the good news to the poor.

			<VERS vnumber="3">The devil said to Jesus, &amp;apos;If you are God's Son, tell this stone to turn into bread.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Jesus answered, &amp;apos;The Scriptures say, &amp;quot;No one can live only on food.&amp;quot; &amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Then the devil led Jesus up to a high place and quickly showed him all the nations on earth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">The devil said, &amp;apos;I will give all this power and glory to you. It has been given to me, and I can give it to anyone I want to.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Just worship me, and you can have it all.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Jesus answered, &amp;apos;The Scriptures say:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Finally, the devil took Jesus to Jerusalem and had him stand on top of the temple. The devil said, &amp;apos;If you are God's Son, jump off.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Jesus answered, &amp;apos;The Scriptures also say, &amp;quot;Don't try to test the Lord your God!&amp;quot; &amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">After the devil had finished testing Jesus in every way possible, he left him for a while.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="15">He taught in the Jewish synagogues, and everyone praised him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Jesus went back to Nazareth, where he had been brought up, and as usual he went to the synagogue on the Sabbath. When he stood up to read from the Scriptures,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">he was given the book of Isaiah the prophet. He opened it and read,</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="19">and to say, &amp;quot;This is the year</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Jesus closed the book, then handed it back to the man in charge and sat down. Everyone in the synagogue looked straight at Jesus.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="30">But Jesus slipped through the crowd and got away.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">Jesus went to the town of Capernaum in Galilee and taught the people on the Sabbath.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="33">There in the synagogue was a man with an evil spirit. He yelled out,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">&amp;apos;Hey, Jesus of Nazareth, what do you want with us? Are you here to get rid of us? I know who you are! You are God's Holy One.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">Jesus ordered the evil spirit to be quiet and come out. The demon threw the man to the ground in front of everyone and left without harming him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">They all were amazed and kept saying to each other, &amp;apos;What kind of teaching is this? He has power to order evil spirits out of people!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">News about Jesus spread all over that part of the country.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">Jesus left the synagogue and went to Simon's home. When Jesus got there, he was told that Simon's mother-in-law was sick with a high fever.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">So Jesus went over to her and ordered the fever to go away. Right then she was able to get up and serve them a meal.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">After the sun had set, people with all kinds of diseases were brought to Jesus. He put his hands on each one of them and healed them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">Demons went out of many people and shouted, &amp;apos;You are the Son of God!&amp;apos; But Jesus ordered the demons not to speak because they knew he was the Messiah.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">The next morning Jesus went out to a place where he could be alone, and crowds came looking for him. When they found him, they tried to stop him from leaving.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43">But Jesus said, &amp;apos;People in other towns must hear the good news about God's kingdom. This is why I was sent.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44">So he kept on preaching in the synagogues in Judea.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="5">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Jesus was standing on the shore of Lake Gennesaret, teaching the people as they crowded around him to hear God's message.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Near the shore he saw two boats left there by some fishermen who had gone to wash their nets.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Jesus got into the boat that belonged to Simon and asked him to row it out a little way from the shore. Then Jesus sat down in the boat to teach the crowd. Jesus told Simon, &amp;apos;Don't be afraid! From now on you will bring in people instead of fish.&amp;apos; God had given Jesus the power to heal the sick, No one uses a new piece of cloth to patch old clothes. The patch would shrink and make the hole even bigger.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">When Jesus had finished speaking, he told Simon, &amp;apos;Row the boat out into the deep water and let your nets down to catch some fish.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">&amp;apos;Master,&amp;apos; Simon answered, &amp;apos;we have worked hard all night long and have not caught a thing. But if you tell me to, I will let the nets down.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">They did this and caught so many fish that their nets began ripping apart.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Then they signaled for their partners in the other boat to come and help them. The men came, and together they filled the two boats so full that they both began to sink.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">When Simon Peter saw this happen, he knelt down in front of Jesus and said, &amp;apos;Lord, don't come near me! I am a sinner.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Peter and everyone with him were completely surprised at all the fish they had caught.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">His partners James and John, the sons of Zebedee, were surprised too.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">The men pulled their boats up on the shore. Then they left everything and went with Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Jesus came to a town where there was a man who had leprosy. When the man saw Jesus, he knelt down to the ground in front of Jesus and begged, &amp;apos;Lord, you have the power to make me well, if only you wanted to.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Jesus put his hand on him and said, &amp;apos;I want to! Now you are well.&amp;apos; At once the man's leprosy disappeared.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Jesus told him, &amp;apos;Don't tell anyone about this, but go and show yourself to the priest. Offer a gift to the priest, just as Moses commanded, and everyone will know that you have been healed.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">News about Jesus kept spreading. Large crowds came to listen to him teach and to be healed of their diseases.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">But Jesus would often go to some place where he could be alone and pray.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">One day some Pharisees and experts in the Law of Moses sat listening to Jesus teach. They had come from every village in Galilee and Judea and from Jerusalem.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">and some people came carrying a man on a mat because he could not walk. They tried to take him inside the house and put him in front of Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">But because of the crowd, they could not get him to Jesus. So they went up on the roof, where they removed some tiles and let the mat down in the middle of the room.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">When Jesus saw how much faith they had, he said to the man, &amp;apos;My friend, your sins are forgiven.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">The Pharisees and the experts began arguing, &amp;apos;Jesus must think he is God! Only God can forgive sins.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Jesus knew what they were thinking, and he said, &amp;apos;Why are you thinking this?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">Is it easier for me to tell this man that his sins are forgiven or to tell him to get up and walk?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">But now you will see that the Son of Man has the right to forgive sins here on earth.&amp;apos; Jesus then said to the man, &amp;apos;Get up! Pick up your mat and walk home.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">At once the man stood up in front of everyone. He picked up his mat and went home, giving thanks to God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">Everyone was amazed and praised God. What they saw surprised them, and they said, &amp;apos;We have seen a great miracle today!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">Later, Jesus went out and saw a tax collector named Levi sitting at the place for paying taxes. Jesus said to him, &amp;apos;Follow me.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">Levi left everything and went with Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">In his home Levi gave a big dinner for Jesus. Many tax collectors and other guests were also there.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">The Pharisees and some of their teachers of the Law of Moses grumbled to Jesus' disciples, &amp;apos;Why do you eat and drink with these tax collectors and other sinners?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">Jesus answered, &amp;apos;Healthy people don't need a doctor, but sick people do.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">I didn't come to invite good people to turn to God. I came to invite sinners.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">Some people said to Jesus, &amp;apos;John's followers often pray and go without eating, and so do the followers of the Pharisees. But your disciples never go without eating or drinking.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">Jesus told them, &amp;apos;The friends of a bridegroom don't go without eating while he is still with them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">But the time will come when he will be taken from them. Then they will go without eating.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">Jesus then told them these sayings:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">No one pours new wine into old wineskins. The new wine would swell and burst the old skins. Then the wine would be lost, and the skins would be ruined.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">New wine must be put only into new wineskins.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">No one wants new wine after drinking old wine. They say, &amp;apos;The old wine is better.&amp;apos;</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="6">
			<VERS vnumber="1">One Sabbath when Jesus and his disciples were walking through some wheat fields, the disciples picked some wheat. They rubbed the husks off with their hands and started eating the grain. God will bless you people who are poor. His kingdom belongs to you! you hungry people. You will have plenty to eat! God will bless you people who are now crying. You will laugh! are in for trouble. You have already had an easy life! are in for trouble. You will go hungry! You people who are laughing now are in for trouble. You are going to cry and weep! Love your enemies, and be good to everyone who hates you. Don't judge others, and God won't judge you. Don't be hard on others, and God won't be hard on you. Forgive others, and God will forgive you. Can one blind person lead another blind person? Won't they both fall into a ditch?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Some Pharisees said, &amp;apos;Why are you picking grain on the Sabbath? You're not supposed to do that!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Jesus answered, &amp;apos;You surely have read what David did when he and his followers were hungry.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">He went into the house of God and took the sacred loaves of bread that only priests were supposed to eat. He not only ate some himself, but even gave some to his followers.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Jesus finished by saying, &amp;apos;The Son of Man is Lord over the Sabbath.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">On another Sabbath Jesus was teaching in a synagogue, and a man with a paralyzed right hand was there.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Some Pharisees and teachers of the Law of Moses kept watching Jesus to see if he would heal the man. They did this because they wanted to accuse Jesus of doing something wrong.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Jesus knew what they were thinking, so he told the man to stand up where everyone could see him. And the man stood up.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Then Jesus asked, &amp;apos;On the Sabbath should we do good deeds or evil deeds? Should we save someone's life or destroy it?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">After he had looked around at everyone, he told the man, &amp;apos;Stretch out your hand.&amp;apos; He did, and his bad hand became completely well.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">The teachers and the Pharisees were furious and started saying to one another, &amp;apos;What can we do about Jesus?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">About that time Jesus went off to a mountain to pray, and he spent the whole night there.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">The next morning he called his disciples together and chose twelve of them to be his apostles.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">One was Simon, and Jesus named him Peter. Another was Andrew, Peter's brother. There were also James, John, Philip, Bartholomew,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Matthew, Thomas, and James the son of Alphaeus. The rest of the apostles were Simon, known as the Eager One,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Jude, who was the son of James, and Judas Iscariot, who later betrayed Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Jesus and his apostles went down from the mountain and came to some flat, level ground. Many other disciples were there to meet him. Large crowds of people from all over Judea, Jerusalem, and the coastal towns of Tyre and Sidon were there too.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">These people had come to listen to Jesus and to be healed of their diseases. All who were troubled by evil spirits were also healed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Everyone was trying to touch Jesus, because power was going out from him and healing them all.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Jesus looked at his disciples and said:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">God will bless</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">God will bless you when others hate you and won't have anything to do with you. God will bless you when people insult you and say cruel things about you, all because you are a follower of the Son of Man.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">Long ago your own people did these same things to the prophets. So when this happens to you, be happy and jump for joy! You will have a great reward in heaven.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">But you rich people</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">You well-fed people</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">You are in for trouble when everyone says good things about you. That is what your own people said about those prophets who told lies.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">This is what I say to all who will listen to me:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">Ask God to bless anyone who curses you, and pray for everyone who is cruel to you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">If someone slaps you on one cheek, don't stop that person from slapping you on the other cheek. If someone wants to take your coat, don't try to keep back your shirt.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">Give to everyone who asks and don't ask people to return what they have taken from you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">Treat others just as you want to be treated.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">If you love only someone who loves you, will God praise you for that? Even sinners love people who love them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">If you are kind only to someone who is kind to you, will God be pleased with you for that? Even sinners are kind to people who are kind to them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">If you lend money only to someone you think will pay you back, will God be pleased with you for that? Even sinners lend to sinners because they think they will get it all back.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">But love your enemies and be good to them. Lend without expecting to be paid back. Then you will get a great reward, and you will be the true children of God in heaven. He is good even to people who are unthankful and cruel.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">Have pity on others, just as your Father has pity on you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">Jesus said:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">If you give to others, you will be given a full amount in return. It will be packed down, shaken together, and spilling over into your lap. The way you treat others is the way you will be treated.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">Jesus also used some sayings as he spoke to the people. He said:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">Are students better than their teacher? But when they are fully trained, they will be like their teacher.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">You can see the speck in your friend's eye, but you don't notice the log in your own eye.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">How can you say, &amp;apos;My friend, let me take the speck out of your eye,&amp;apos; when you don't see the log in your own eye? You show-offs! First, get the log out of your own eye; then you can see how to take the speck out of your friend's eye.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43">A good tree cannot produce bad fruit, and a bad tree cannot produce good fruit.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44">You can tell what a tree is like by the fruit it produces. You cannot pick figs or grapes from thornbushes.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45">Good people do good things because of the good in their hearts, but bad people do bad things because of the evil in their hearts. Your words show what is in your heart.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46">Why do you keep on saying that I am your Lord, when you refuse to do what I say?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="47">Anyone who comes and listens to me and obeys me</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="48">is like someone who dug down deep and built a house on solid rock. When a flood came and the river rushed against the house, it was built so well that it didn't even shake.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="49">But anyone who hears what I say and doesn't obey me is like someone whose house wasn't built on solid rock. As soon as the river rushed against that house, it was smashed to pieces!</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="7">
			<VERS vnumber="1">After Jesus had finished teaching the people, he went to Capernaum.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">In this town an army officer's servant was sick and about to die. The officer liked his servant very much.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">And when he heard about Jesus, he sent some Jewish leaders to ask him to come and heal the servant. When Jesus wasn't far from the house, the officer sent some friends to tell him, &amp;apos;Lord, don't go to any trouble for me! I am not good enough for you to come into my house. What kind of person did you go out to the desert to see? Was he like tall grass blown about by the wind? What are you people like? What kind of people are you? &amp;apos;We played the flute, but you would not dance! We sang a funeral song, but you would not cry!&amp;apos; &amp;apos;Teacher, what is it?&amp;apos; Simon replied. &amp;apos;You are right,&amp;apos; Jesus said.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">The leaders went to Jesus and begged him to do something. They said, &amp;apos;This man deserves your help!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">He loves our nation and even built us a synagogue.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">So Jesus went with them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">And I am certainly not worthy to come to you. Just say the word, and my servant will get well.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">I have officers who give orders to me, and I have soldiers who take orders from me. I can say to one of them, &amp;quot;Go!&amp;quot; and he goes. I can say to another, &amp;quot;Come!&amp;quot; and he comes. I can say to my servant, &amp;quot;Do this!&amp;quot; and he will do it.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">When Jesus heard this, he was so surprised that he turned and said to the crowd following him, &amp;apos;In all of Israel I've never found anyone with this much faith!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">The officer's friends returned and found the servant well.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Soon Jesus and his disciples were on their way to the town of Nain, and a big crowd was going along with them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">As they came near the gate of the town, they saw people carrying out the body of a widow's only son. Many people from the town were walking along with her.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">When the Lord saw the woman, he felt sorry for her and said, &amp;apos;Don't cry!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Jesus went over and touched the stretcher on which the people were carrying the dead boy. They stopped, and Jesus said, &amp;apos;Young man, get up!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">The boy sat up and began to speak. Jesus then gave him back to his mother.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Everyone was frightened and praised God. They said, &amp;apos;A great prophet is here with us! God has come to his people.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">News about Jesus spread all over Judea and everywhere else in that part of the country.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">When these messengers came to Jesus, they said, &amp;apos;John the Baptist sent us to ask, &amp;quot;Are you the one we should be looking for? Or are we supposed to wait for someone else?&amp;quot; &amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">At that time Jesus was healing many people who were sick or in pain or were troubled by evil spirits, and he was giving sight to a lot of blind people.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Jesus said to the messengers sent by John, &amp;apos;Go and tell John what you have seen and heard. Blind people are now able to see, and the lame can walk. People who have leprosy are being healed, and the deaf can now hear. The dead are raised to life, and the poor are hearing the good news.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">God will bless everyone who doesn't reject me because of what I do.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">After John's messengers had gone, Jesus began speaking to the crowds about John:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">What kind of man did you really go out to see? Was he someone dressed in fine clothes? People who wear expensive clothes and live in luxury are in the king's palace.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">What then did you go out to see? Was he a prophet? He certainly was! I tell you that he was more than a prophet.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">In the Scriptures, God calls John his messenger and says, &amp;apos;I am sending my messenger ahead of you to get things ready for you.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">No one ever born on this earth is greater than John. But whoever is least important in God's kingdom is greater than John.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">Everyone had been listening to John. Even the tax collectors had obeyed God and had done what was right by letting John baptize them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">But the Pharisees and the experts in the Law of Moses refused to obey God and be baptized by John.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">Jesus went on to say:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">You are like children sitting in the market and shouting to each other,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">John the Baptist did not go around eating and drinking, and you said, &amp;apos;John has a demon in him!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">But because the Son of Man goes around eating and drinking, you say, &amp;apos;Jesus eats and drinks too much! He is even a friend of tax collectors and sinners.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">Yet Wisdom is shown to be right by what its followers do.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">A Pharisee invited Jesus to have dinner with him. So Jesus went to the Pharisee's home and got ready to eat.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">When a sinful woman in that town found out that Jesus was there, she bought an expensive bottle of perfume.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">Then she came and stood behind Jesus. She cried and started washing his feet with her tears and drying them with her hair. The woman kissed his feet and poured the perfume on them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">The Pharisee who had invited Jesus saw this and said to himself, &amp;apos;If this man really were a prophet, he would know what kind of woman is touching him! He would know that she is a sinner.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">Jesus said to the Pharisee, &amp;apos;Simon, I have something to say to you.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">Jesus told him, &amp;apos;Two people were in debt to a moneylender. One of them owed him 500 silver coins, and the other owed him 50.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">Since neither of them could pay him back, the moneylender said that they didn't have to pay him anything. Which one of them will like him more?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43">Simon answered, &amp;apos;I suppose it would be the one who had owed more and didn't have to pay it back.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44">He turned toward the woman and said to Simon, &amp;apos;Have you noticed this woman? When I came into your home, you didn't give me any water so I could wash my feet. But she has washed my feet with her tears and dried them with her hair.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45">You didn't greet me with a kiss, but from the time I came in, she has not stopped kissing my feet.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46">You didn't even pour olive oil on my head, but she has poured expensive perfume on my feet.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="47">So I tell you that all her sins are forgiven, and that is why she has shown great love. But anyone who has been forgiven for only a little will show only a little love.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="48">Then Jesus said to the woman, &amp;apos;Your sins are forgiven.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="49">Some other guests started saying to one another, &amp;apos;Who is this who dares to forgive sins?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="50">But Jesus told the woman, &amp;apos;Because of your faith, you are now saved. May God give you peace!&amp;apos;</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="8">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Soon after this, Jesus was going through towns and villages, telling the good news about God's kingdom. His twelve apostles were with him,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">and so were some women who had been healed of evil spirits and all sorts of diseases. One of the women was Mary Magdalene, who once had seven demons in her.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Joanna, Susanna, and many others had also used what they owned to help Jesus and his disciples. Joanna's husband Chuza was one of Herod's officials. When Jesus had finished speaking, he said, &amp;apos;If you have ears, pay attention!&amp;apos; I have explained the secrets about God's kingdom to you. But for others I use stories, so they will look, but not see, and they will hear, but not understand. Suddenly a storm struck the lake, and the boat started sinking. They were in danger. Jesus got up and ordered the wind and waves to stop. They obeyed, and everything was calm. But they were frightened and amazed. They said to each other, &amp;apos;Who is this? He can give orders to the wind and the waves, and they obey him!&amp;apos; The man had often been attacked by the demon. And even though he had been bound with chains and leg irons and kept under guard, he smashed whatever bound him. Then the demon would force him out into lonely places. He answered, &amp;apos;My name is Lots.&amp;apos; He said this because there were &amp;apos;lots&amp;apos; of demons in him. When Jesus got into the boat to start back, While Jesus was on his way, people were crowding all around him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">When a large crowd from several towns had gathered around Jesus, he told them this story:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">A farmer went out to scatter seed in a field. While the farmer was doing this, some of the seeds fell along the road and were stepped on or eaten by birds.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Other seeds fell on rocky ground and started growing. But the plants did not have enough water and soon dried up.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Some other seeds fell where thornbushes grew up and choked the plants.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">The rest of the seeds fell on good ground where they grew and produced a hundred times as many seeds.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Jesus' disciples asked him what the story meant.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">So he answered:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">This is what the story means: The seed is God's message,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">and the seeds that fell along the road are the people who hear the message. But the devil comes and snatches the message out of their hearts, so they will not believe and be saved.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">The seeds that fell on rocky ground are the people who gladly hear the message and accept it. But they don't have deep roots, and they believe only for a little while. As soon as life gets hard, they give up.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">The seeds that fell among the thornbushes are also people who hear the message. But they are so eager for riches and pleasures that they never produce anything.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Those seeds that fell on good ground are the people who listen to the message and keep it in good and honest hearts. They last and produce a harvest.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">No one lights a lamp and puts it under a bowl or under a bed. A lamp is always put on a lampstand, so people who come into a house will see the light.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">There is nothing hidden that will not be found. There is no secret that will not be well known.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Pay attention to how you listen! Everyone who has something will be given more, but people who have nothing will lose what little they think they have.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Jesus' mother and brothers went to see him, but because of the crowd they could not get near him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Someone told Jesus, &amp;apos;Your mother and brothers are standing outside and want to see you.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Jesus answered, &amp;apos;My mother and my brothers are those people who hear and obey God's message.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">One day, Jesus and his disciples got into a boat, and he said, &amp;apos;Let's cross the lake.&amp;apos; They started out,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">and while they were sailing across, he went to sleep.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">So they went to Jesus and woke him up, &amp;apos;Master, Master! We are about to drown!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">Then Jesus asked the disciples, &amp;apos;Don't you have any faith?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">Jesus and his disciples sailed across Lake Galilee and came to shore near the town of Gerasa.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">As Jesus was getting out of the boat, he was met by a man from this town. The man had demons in him. He had gone naked for a long time and no longer lived in a house, but in the graveyard.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">The man saw Jesus and screamed. He knelt down in front of him and shouted, &amp;apos;Jesus, Son of God Most High, what do you want with me? I beg you not to torture me!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">He said this because Jesus had already told the evil spirit to go out of him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">Jesus asked the man, &amp;apos;What is your name?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">They begged Jesus not to send them to the deep pit, where they would be punished.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">A large herd of pigs was feeding there on the hillside. So the demons begged Jesus to let them go into the pigs, and Jesus let them go.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">Then the demons left the man and went into the pigs. The whole herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake and drowned.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">When the men taking care of the pigs saw this, they ran to spread the news in the town and on the farms.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">The people went out to see what had happened, and when they came to Jesus, they also found the man. The demons had gone out of him, and he was sitting there at the feet of Jesus. He had clothes on and was in his right mind. But the people were terrified.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">Then all who had seen the man healed told about it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">Everyone from around Gerasa begged Jesus to leave, because they were so frightened.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">the man who had been healed begged to go with him. But Jesus sent him off and said,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">&amp;apos;Go back home and tell everyone how much God has done for you.&amp;apos; The man then went all over town, telling everything that Jesus had done for him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">Everyone had been waiting for Jesus, and when he came back, a crowd was there to welcome him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">Just then the man in charge of the synagogue came and knelt down in front of Jesus. His name was Jairus, and he begged Jesus to come to his home</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">because his twelve-year-old child was dying. She was his only daughter.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43">In the crowd was a woman who had been bleeding for twelve years. She had spent everything she had on doctors, but none of them could make her well.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44">As soon as she came up behind Jesus and barely touched his clothes, her bleeding stopped.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45">&amp;apos;Who touched me?&amp;apos; Jesus asked. While everyone was denying it, Peter said, &amp;apos;Master, people are crowding all around and pushing you from every side.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46">But Jesus answered, &amp;apos;Someone touched me, because I felt power going out from me.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="47">The woman knew that she could not hide, so she came trembling and knelt down in front of Jesus. She told everyone why she had touched him and that she had been healed at once.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="48">Jesus said to the woman, &amp;apos;You are now well because of your faith. May God give you peace!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="49">While Jesus was speaking, someone came from Jairus' home and said, &amp;apos;Your daughter has died! Why bother the teacher anymore?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="50">When Jesus heard this, he told Jairus, &amp;apos;Don't worry! Have faith, and your daughter will get well.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="51">Jesus went into the house, but he did not let anyone else go with him, except Peter, John, James, and the girl's father and mother.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="52">Everyone was crying and weeping for the girl. But Jesus said, &amp;apos;The child isn't dead. She is just asleep.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="53">The people laughed at him because they knew she was dead.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="54">Jesus took hold of the girl's hand and said, &amp;apos;Child, get up!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="55">She came back to life and got right up. Jesus told them to give her something to eat.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="56">Her parents were surprised, but Jesus ordered them not to tell anyone what had happened.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="9">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Jesus called together his twelve apostles and gave them complete power over all demons and diseases.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Then he sent them to tell about God's kingdom and to heal the sick.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">He told them, &amp;apos;Don't take anything with you! Don't take a walking stick or a traveling bag or food or money or even a change of clothes.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">When you are welcomed into a home, stay there until you leave that town.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">If people won't welcome you, leave the town and shake the dust from your feet as a warning to them.&amp;apos; Jesus said to his disciples, &amp;apos;Tell the people to sit in groups of 50.&amp;apos; Peter answered, &amp;apos;You are the Messiah sent from God.&amp;apos; If any of you want to be my followers, you must forget about yourself. You must take up your cross every day and follow me. Then Jesus said to the man, &amp;apos;Bring your son to me.&amp;apos; While everyone was still amazed at what Jesus was doing, he said to his disciples,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">The apostles left and went from village to village, telling the good news and healing people everywhere.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Herod the ruler heard about all that was happening, and he was worried. Some people were saying John the Baptist had come back to life.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Others were saying Elijah had come or one of the prophets from long ago had come back to life.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">But Herod said, &amp;apos;I had John's head cut off! Who is this I hear so much about?&amp;apos; Herod was eager to meet Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">The apostles came back and told Jesus everything they had done. He then took them with him to the village of Bethsaida, where they could be alone.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">But a lot of people found out about this and followed him. Jesus welcomed them. He spoke about God's kingdom and healed everyone who was sick.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Late in the afternoon the twelve apostles came to Jesus and said, &amp;apos;Send the crowd to the villages and farms around here. They need to find a place to stay and something to eat. There is nothing in this place. It's like a desert!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Jesus answered, &amp;apos;You give them something to eat.&amp;apos; But they replied, &amp;apos;We have only five small loaves of bread and two fish. If we are going to feed all these people, we will have to go and buy food.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">There were about 5,000 men in the crowd.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">They did this, and all the people sat down.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Jesus took the five loaves and the two fish. He looked up toward heaven and blessed the food. Then he broke the bread and fish and handed them to his disciples to give to the people.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Everyone ate all they wanted. What was left over filled twelve baskets.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">When Jesus was alone praying, his disciples came to him, and he asked them, &amp;apos;What do people say about me?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">They answered, &amp;apos;Some say you are John the Baptist or Elijah or a prophet from long ago who has come back to life.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Jesus then asked, &amp;apos;But who do you say I am?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Jesus strictly warned his disciples not to tell anyone about this.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Jesus told his disciples, &amp;apos;The nation's leaders, the chief priests, and the teachers of the Law of Moses will make the Son of Man suffer terribly. They will reject him and kill him, but three days later he will rise to life.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">Then Jesus said to all the people:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">If you want to save your life, you will destroy it. But if you give up your life for me, you will save it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">What will you gain, if you own the whole world but destroy yourself or waste your life?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">If you are ashamed of me and my message, the Son of Man will be ashamed of you when he comes in his glory and in the glory of his Father and the holy angels.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">You can be sure some of the people standing here will not die before they see God's kingdom.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">About eight days later Jesus took Peter, John, and James with him and went up on a mountain to pray.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">While he was praying, his face changed, and his clothes became shining white.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">Suddenly Moses and Elijah were there speaking with him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">They appeared in heavenly glory and talked about all that Jesus' death in Jerusalem would mean.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">Peter and the other two disciples had been sound asleep. All at once they woke up and saw how glorious Jesus was. They also saw the two men who were with him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">Moses and Elijah were about to leave, when Peter said to Jesus, &amp;apos;Master, it is good for us to be here! Let us make three shelters, one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.&amp;apos; But Peter did not know what he was talking about.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">While Peter was still speaking, a shadow from a cloud passed over, and they were frightened as the cloud covered them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">From the cloud a voice spoke, &amp;apos;This is my chosen Son. Listen to what he says!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">After the voice had spoken, Peter, John, and James saw only Jesus. For some time they kept quiet and did not say anything about what they had seen.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">The next day Jesus and his three disciples came down from the mountain and were met by a large crowd.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">Just then someone in the crowd shouted, &amp;apos;Teacher, please do something for my son! He is my only child!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">A demon often attacks him and makes him scream. It shakes him until he foams at the mouth, and it won't leave him until it has completely worn the boy out.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">I begged your disciples to force out the demon, but they couldn't do it.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">Jesus said to them, &amp;apos;You people are stubborn and don't have any faith! How much longer must I be with you? Why do I have to put up with you?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">While the boy was being brought, the demon attacked him and made him shake all over. Jesus ordered the demon to stop. Then he healed the boy and gave him back to his father.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43">Everyone was amazed at God's great power.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44">&amp;apos;Pay close attention to what I am telling you! The Son of Man will be handed over to his enemies.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45">But the disciples did not know what he meant. The meaning was hidden from them. They could not understand it, and they were afraid to ask.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46">Jesus' disciples were arguing about which one of them was the greatest.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="47">Jesus knew what they were thinking, and he had a child stand there beside him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="48">Then he said to his disciples, &amp;apos;When you welcome even a child because of me, you welcome me. And when you welcome me, you welcome the one who sent me. Whichever one of you is the most humble is the greatest.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="49">John said, &amp;apos;Master, we saw a man using your name to force demons out of people. But we told him to stop, because he isn't one of us.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="50">&amp;apos;Don't stop him!&amp;apos; Jesus said. &amp;apos;Anyone who isn't against you is for you.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="51">Not long before it was time for Jesus to be taken up to heaven, he made up his mind to go to Jerusalem.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="52">He sent some messengers on ahead to a Samaritan village to get things ready for him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="53">But he was on his way to Jerusalem, so the people there refused to welcome him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="54">When the disciples James and John saw what was happening, they asked, &amp;apos;Lord, do you want us to call down fire from heaven to destroy these people?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="55">But Jesus turned and corrected them for what they had said.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="56">Then they all went on to another village.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="57">Along the way someone said to Jesus, &amp;apos;I'll follow you anywhere!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="58">Jesus said, &amp;apos;Foxes have dens, and birds have nests, but the Son of Man doesn't have a place to call his own.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="59">Jesus told someone else to come with him. But the man said, &amp;apos;Lord, let me wait until I bury my father.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="60">Jesus answered, &amp;apos;Let the dead take care of the dead, while you go and tell about God's kingdom.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="61">Then someone said to Jesus, &amp;apos;I want to follow you, Lord, but first let me go back and take care of things at home.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="62">Jesus answered, &amp;apos;Anyone who starts plowing and keeps looking back isn't worth a thing to God's kingdom!&amp;apos;</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="10">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Later the Lord chose 72 other followers and sent them out two by two to every town and village where he was about to go.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">He said to them: A large crop is in the fields, but there are only a few workers. Ask the Lord in charge of the harvest to send out workers to bring it in. I saw Satan fall from heaven like a flash of lightning. My Father, Lord of heaven and earth, I am grateful that you hid all this from wise and educated people and showed it to ordinary people. Yes, Father, this is what pleased you. As a man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho, robbers attacked him and grabbed everything he had. They beat him up and ran off, leaving him half dead. Jesus said, &amp;apos;Go and do the same!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Now go, but remember, I am sending you like lambs into a pack of wolves.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Don't take along a moneybag or a traveling bag or sandals. And don't waste time greeting people on the road.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">As soon as you enter a home, say, &amp;apos;God bless this home with peace.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">If the people living there are peace-loving, your prayer for peace will bless them. But if they are not peace-loving, your prayer will return to you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Stay with the same family, eating and drinking whatever they give you, because workers are worth what they earn. Don't move around from house to house.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">If the people of a town welcome you, eat whatever they offer.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Heal their sick and say, &amp;apos;God's kingdom will soon be here!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">But if the people of a town refuse to welcome you, go out into the street and say,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">&amp;apos;We are shaking the dust from our feet as a warning to you. And you can be sure that God's kingdom will soon be here!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">I tell you that on the day of judgment the people of Sodom will get off easier than the people of that town!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">You people of Chorazin are in for trouble! You people of Bethsaida are also in for trouble! If the miracles that took place in your towns had happened in Tyre and Sidon, the people there would have turned to God long ago. They would have dressed in sackcloth and put ashes on their heads.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">On the day of judgment the people of Tyre and Sidon will get off easier than you will.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">People of Capernaum, do you think you will be honored in heaven? Well, you will go down to hell!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">My followers, whoever listens to you is listening to me. Anyone who says &amp;apos;No&amp;apos; to you is saying &amp;apos;No&amp;apos; to me. And anyone who says &amp;apos;No&amp;apos; to me is really saying &amp;apos;No&amp;apos; to the one who sent me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">When the 72 followers returned, they were excited and said, &amp;apos;Lord, even the demons obeyed when we spoke in your name!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Jesus told them:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">I have given you the power to trample on snakes and scorpions and to defeat the power of your enemy Satan. Nothing can harm you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">But don't be happy because evil spirits obey you. Be happy that your names are written in heaven!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">At that same time, Jesus felt the joy that comes from the Holy Spirit, and he said:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">My Father has given me everything, and he is the only one who knows the Son. The only one who really knows the Father is the Son. But the Son wants to tell others about the Father, so they can know him too.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">Jesus then turned to his disciples and said to them in private, &amp;apos;You are really blessed to see what you see!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">Many prophets and kings were eager to see what you see and to hear what you hear. But I tell you they did not see or hear.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">An expert in the Law of Moses stood up and asked Jesus a question to see what he would say. &amp;apos;Teacher,&amp;apos; he asked, &amp;apos;what must I do to have eternal life?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">Jesus answered, &amp;apos;What is written in the Scriptures? How do you understand them?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">The man replied, &amp;apos;The Scriptures say, &amp;quot;Love the Lord your God with all your heart, soul, strength, and mind.&amp;quot; They also say, &amp;quot;Love your neighbors as much as you love yourself.&amp;quot; &amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">Jesus said, &amp;apos;You have given the right answer. If you do this, you will have eternal life.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">But the man wanted to show that he knew what he was talking about. So he asked Jesus, &amp;apos;Who are my neighbors?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">Jesus replied:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">A priest happened to be going down the same road. But when he saw the man, he walked by on the other side.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">Later a temple helper came to the same place. But when he saw the man who had been beaten up, he also went by on the other side.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">A man from Samaria then came traveling along that road. When he saw the man, he felt sorry for him</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">and went over to him. He treated his wounds with olive oil and wine and bandaged them. Then he put him on his own donkey and took him to an inn, where he took care of him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">The next morning he gave the innkeeper two silver coins and said, &amp;apos;Please take care of the man. If you spend more than this on him, I will pay you when I return.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">Then Jesus asked, &amp;apos;Which one of these three people was a real neighbor to the man who was beaten up by robbers?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">The expert in the Law of Moses answered, &amp;apos;The one who showed pity.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">The Lord and his disciples were traveling along and came to a village. When they got there, a woman named Martha welcomed him into her home.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">She had a sister named Mary, who sat down in front of the Lord and was listening to what he said.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">Martha was worried about all that had to be done. Finally, she went to Jesus and said, &amp;apos;Lord, doesn't it bother you that my sister has left me to do all the work by myself? Tell her to come and help me!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">The Lord answered, &amp;apos;Martha, Martha! You are worried and upset about so many things,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">but only one thing is necessary. Mary has chosen what is best, and it will not be taken away from her.&amp;apos;</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="11">
			<VERS vnumber="1">When Jesus had finished praying, one of his disciples said to him, &amp;apos;Lord, teach us to pray, just as John taught his followers to pray.&amp;apos; &amp;quot;Father, help us to honor your name. Come and set up your kingdom. as we forgive everyone who has done wrong to us. And keep us from being tempted.&amp;quot; &amp;apos; Suppose one of you goes to a friend in the middle of the night and says, &amp;apos;Let me borrow three loaves of bread. A kingdom where people fight each other will end up in ruin. And a family that fights will break up. You Pharisees clean the outside of cups and dishes, but on the inside you are greedy and evil. You teachers are also in for trouble! You load people down with heavy burdens, but you won't lift a finger to help them carry the loads.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">So Jesus told them, &amp;apos;Pray in this way:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Give us each day the food we need. You people of today are evil! You keep looking for a sign from God. But what happened to Jonah is the only sign you will be given.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Forgive our sins,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Then Jesus went on to say:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">A friend of mine has dropped in, and I don't have a thing for him to eat.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">And suppose your friend answers, &amp;apos;Don't bother me! The door is bolted, and my children and I are in bed. I cannot get up to give you something.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">He may not get up and give you the bread, just because you are his friend. But he will get up and give you as much as you need, simply because you are not ashamed to keep on asking.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">So I tell you to ask and you will receive, search and you will find, knock and the door will be opened for you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Everyone who asks will receive, everyone who searches will find, and the door will be opened for everyone who knocks.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Which one of you fathers would give your hungry child a snake if the child asked for a fish?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Which one of you would give your child a scorpion if the child asked for an egg?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">As bad as you are, you still know how to give good gifts to your children. But your heavenly Father is even more ready to give the Holy Spirit to anyone who asks.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Jesus forced a demon out of a man who could not talk. And after the demon had gone out, the man started speaking, and the crowds were amazed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">But some people said, &amp;apos;He forces out demons by the power of Beelzebul, the ruler of the demons!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Others wanted to put Jesus to the test. So they asked him to show them a sign from God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Jesus knew what they were thinking, and he said:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">If Satan fights against himself, how can his kingdom last? Yet you say that I force out demons by the power of Beelzebul.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">If I use his power to force out demons, whose power do your own followers use to force them out? They are the ones who will judge you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">But if I use God's power to force out demons, it proves that God's kingdom has already come to you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">When a strong man arms himself and guards his home, everything he owns is safe.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">But if a stronger man comes and defeats him, he will carry off the weapons in which the strong man trusted. Then he will divide with others what he has taken.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">If you are not on my side, you are against me. If you don't gather in the crop with me, you scatter it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">When an evil spirit leaves a person, it travels through the desert, looking for a place to rest. But when it doesn't find a place, it says, &amp;apos;I will go back to the home I left.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">When it gets there and finds the place clean and fixed up,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">it goes off and finds seven other evil spirits even worse than itself. They all come and make their home there, and that person ends up in worse shape than before.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">While Jesus was still talking, a woman in the crowd spoke up, &amp;apos;The woman who gave birth to you and nursed you is blessed!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">Jesus replied, &amp;apos;That's true, but the people who are really blessed are the ones who hear and obey God's message!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">As crowds were gathering around Jesus, he said:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">Just as Jonah was a sign to the people of Nineveh, the Son of Man will be a sign to the people of today.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">When the judgment comes, the Queen of the South will stand there with you and condemn you. She traveled a long way to hear Solomon's wisdom, and yet here is something far greater than Solomon.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">The people of Nineveh will also stand there with you and condemn you. They turned to God when Jonah preached, and yet here is something far greater than Jonah.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">No one lights a lamp and then hides it or puts it under a clay pot. A lamp is put on a lampstand, so everyone who comes into the house can see the light.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">Your eyes are the lamp for your body. When your eyes are good, you have all the light you need. But when your eyes are bad, everything is dark.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">So be sure your light isn't darkness.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">If you have light, and nothing is dark, then light will be everywhere, as when a lamp shines brightly on you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">When Jesus finished speaking, a Pharisee invited him home for a meal. Jesus went and sat down to eat.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">The Pharisee was surprised that he did not wash his hands before eating.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">So the Lord said to him:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">You fools! Didn't God make both the outside and the inside?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">If you would only give what you have to the poor, everything you do would please God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">You Pharisees are in for trouble! You give God a tenth of the spices from your gardens, such as mint and rue. But you cheat people, and you don't love God. You should be fair and kind to others and still give a tenth to God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43">You Pharisees are in for trouble! You love the front seats in the synagogues, and you like to be greeted with honor in the market.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44">But you are in for trouble! You are like unmarked graves that people walk on without even knowing it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45">A teacher of the Law of Moses spoke up, &amp;apos;Teacher, you said cruel things about us.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46">Jesus replied:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="47">Yes, you are really in for trouble. You build monuments to honor the prophets your own people murdered long ago.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="48">You must think that was the right thing for your people to do, or else you would not have built monuments for the prophets they murdered.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="49">Because of your evil deeds, the Wisdom of God said, &amp;apos;I will send prophets and apostles to you. But you will murder some and mistreat others.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="50">You people living today will be punished for all the prophets who have been murdered since the beginning of the world.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="51">This includes every prophet from the time of Abel to the time of Zechariah, who was murdered between the altar and the temple. You people will certainly be punished for all of this.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="52">You teachers of the Law of Moses are really in for trouble! You carry the keys to the door of knowledge about God. But you never go in, and you keep others from going in.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="53">Jesus was about to leave, but the teachers and the Pharisees wanted to get even with him. They tried to make him say what he thought about other things,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="54">so they could catch him saying something wrong.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="12">
			<VERS vnumber="1">As thousands of people crowded around Jesus and were stepping on each other, he told his disciples: Be sure to guard against the dishonest teaching of the Pharisees! It is their way of fooling people.</VERS>

A rich man's farm produced a big crop, I tell you not to worry about your life! Don't worry about having something to eat or wear. Who are faithful and wise servants? Who are the ones the master will put in charge of giving the other servants their food supplies at the proper time? As soon as you see a cloud coming up in the west, you say, &amp;apos;It's going to rain,&amp;apos; and it does.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1">About this same time Jesus was told that Pilate had given orders for some people from Galilee to be killed while they were offering sacrifices.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Jesus replied: Do you think that these people were worse sinners than everyone else in Galilee just because of what happened to them? A man had a fig tree growing in his vineyard. One day he went out to pick some figs, but he didn't find any. Jesus answered: But the owner will answer, &amp;apos;I don't know a thing about you!&amp;apos; Go tell that fox, &amp;apos;I am going to force out demons and heal people today and tomorrow, and three days later I'll be through.&amp;apos; &amp;apos;Blessed is the one who comes in the name of the Lord.&amp;apos;</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="18">Jesus said, &amp;apos;What is God's kingdom like? What can I compare it with?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">It is like what happens when someone plants a mustard seed in a garden. The seed grows as big as a tree, and birds nest in its branches.&amp;apos;</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1">One Sabbath, Jesus was having dinner in the home of an important Pharisee, and everyone was carefully watching Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">All of a sudden a man with swollen legs stood up in front of him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Jesus turned and asked the Pharisees and the teachers of the Law of Moses, &amp;apos;Is it right to heal on the Sabbath?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">But they did not say a word. Jesus took hold of the man. Then he healed him and sent him away. When you give a dinner or a banquet, don't invite your friends and family and relatives and rich neighbors. If you do, they will invite you in return, and you will be paid back. A man once gave a great banquet and invited a lot of guests.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Afterwards, Jesus asked the people, &amp;apos;If your son or ox falls into a well, wouldn't you pull him out at once, even on the Sabbath?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">There was nothing they could say.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Jesus saw how the guests had tried to take the best seats. So he told them:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">When you are invited to a wedding feast, don't sit in the best place. Someone more important may have been invited.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Then the one who invited you will come and say, &amp;apos;Give your place to this other guest!&amp;apos; You will be embarrassed and will have to sit in the worst place.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">When you are invited to be a guest, go and sit in the worst place. Then the one who invited you may come and say, &amp;apos;My friend, take a better seat!&amp;apos; You will then be honored in front of all the other guests.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">If you put yourself above others, you will be put down. But if you humble yourself, you will be honored.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Then Jesus said to the man who had invited him:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">When you give a feast, invite the poor, the paralyzed, the lame, and the blind.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">They cannot pay you back. But God will bless you and reward you when his people rise from death.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">After Jesus had finished speaking, one of the guests said, &amp;apos;The greatest blessing of all is to be at the banquet in God's kingdom!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Jesus told him:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">When the banquet was ready, he sent a servant to tell the guests, &amp;apos;Everything is ready! Please come.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">One guest after another started making excuses. The first one said, &amp;apos;I bought some land, and I've got to look it over. Please excuse me.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Another guest said, &amp;apos;I bought five teams of oxen, and I need to try them out. Please excuse me.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Still another guest said, &amp;apos;I've just now married, and I can't be there.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">The servant told his master what happened, and the master became so angry he said, &amp;apos;Go as fast as you can to every street and alley in town! Bring in everyone who is poor or paralyzed or blind or lame.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">When the servant returned, he said, &amp;apos;Master, I've done what you told me, and there is still plenty of room for more people.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">His master then told him, &amp;apos;Go out along the back roads and make people come in, so my house will be full.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">Not one of the guests I first invited will get even a bite of my food!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">Large crowds were walking along with Jesus, when he turned and said:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">You cannot be my disciple, unless you love me more than you love your father and mother, your wife and children, and your brothers and sisters. You cannot follow me unless you love me more than you love your own life.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">You cannot be my disciple unless you carry your own cross and follow me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">Suppose one of you wants to build a tower. What is the first thing you will do? Won't you sit down and figure out how much it will cost and if you have enough money to pay for it?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">Otherwise, you will start building the tower, but not be able to finish. Then everyone who sees what is happening will laugh at you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">They will say, &amp;apos;You started building, but could not finish the job.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">What will a king do if he has only 10,000 soldiers to defend himself against a king who is about to attack him with 20,000 soldiers? Before he goes out to battle, won't he first sit down and decide if he can win?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">If he thinks he won't be able to defend himself, he will send messengers and ask for peace while the other king is still a long way off.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">So then, you cannot be my disciple unless you give away everything you own.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">Salt is good, but if it no longer tastes like salt, how can it be made to taste salty again?</VERS>

Once a man had two sons. His father came out and begged him to go in.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Then Jesus told them this story:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">If any of you has 100 sheep, and one of them gets lost, what will you do? Won't you leave the 99 in the field and go look for the lost sheep until you find it?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">And when you find it, you will be so glad that you will put it on your shoulder</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">and carry it home. Then you will call in your friends and neighbors and say, &amp;apos;Let's celebrate! I've found my lost sheep.&amp;apos;</VERS>

The things that most people think are important are worthless as far as God is concerned. The rich man also died and was buried.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="30">Then the rich man said, &amp;apos;No, that's not enough! If only someone from the dead would go to them, they would listen and turn to God.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">So Abraham said, &amp;apos;If they won't pay attention to Moses and the prophets, they won't listen even to someone who comes back from the dead.&amp;apos;</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="17">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Jesus said to his disciples: There will always be something that causes people to sin. But anyone who causes them to sin is in for trouble. A person who causes even one of my little followers to sin If you had faith no bigger than a tiny mustard seed, you could tell this mulberry tree to pull itself up, roots and all, and to plant itself in the ocean. And it would! On their way they were healed. The time will come when you will long to see one of the days of the Son of Man, but you will not.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">would be better off thrown into the ocean with a heavy stone tied around their neck.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">So be careful what you do. Correct any followers of mine who sin, and forgive the ones who say they are sorry. Jesus said, &amp;apos;Where there is a corpse, there will always be vultures.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Even if one of them mistreats you seven times in one day and says, &amp;apos;I am sorry,&amp;apos; you should still forgive that person.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">The apostles said to the Lord, &amp;apos;Make our faith stronger!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Jesus replied:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">If your servant comes in from plowing or from taking care of the sheep, would you say, &amp;apos;Welcome! Come on in and have something to eat&amp;apos;?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">No, you wouldn't say that. You would say, &amp;apos;Prepare me something to eat. Get ready to serve me, so I can have my meal. Then later on you can eat and drink.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Servants don't deserve special thanks for doing what they are supposed to do.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">And that's how it should be with you. When you've done all you should, then say, &amp;apos;We are merely servants, and we have simply done our duty.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">On his way to Jerusalem, Jesus went along the border between Samaria and Galilee.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">As he was going into a village, ten men with leprosy came toward him. They stood at a distance</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">and shouted, &amp;apos;Jesus, Master, have pity on us!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Jesus looked at them and said, &amp;apos;Go show yourselves to the priests.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">When one of them discovered that he was healed, he came back, shouting praises to God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">He bowed down at the feet of Jesus and thanked him. The man was from the country of Samaria.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Jesus asked, &amp;apos;Weren't ten men healed? Where are the other nine?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Why was this foreigner the only one who came back to thank God?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Then Jesus told the man, &amp;apos;You may get up and go. Your faith has made you well.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Some Pharisees asked Jesus when God's kingdom would come. He answered, &amp;apos;God's kingdom isn't something you can see.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">There is no use saying, &amp;quot;Look! Here it is&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Look! There it is.&amp;quot; God's kingdom is here with you.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Jesus said to his disciples:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">When people say to you, &amp;apos;Look there,&amp;apos; or &amp;apos;Look here,&amp;apos; don't go looking for him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">The day of the Son of Man will be like lightning flashing across the sky.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">But first he must suffer terribly and be rejected by the people of today.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">When the Son of Man comes, things will be just as they were when Noah lived.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">People were eating, drinking, and getting married right up to the day when Noah went into the big boat. Then the flood came and drowned everyone on earth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">When Lot lived, people were also eating and drinking. They were buying, selling, planting, and building.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">But on the very day Lot left Sodom, fiery flames poured down from the sky and killed everyone.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">The same will happen on the day when the Son of Man appears.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">At that time no one on a rooftop should go down into the house to get anything. No one in a field should go back to the house for anything.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">Remember what happened to Lot's wife.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">People who try to save their lives will lose them, and those who lose their lives will save them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">On that night two people will be sleeping in the same bed, but only one will be taken. The other will be left.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">Then Jesus' disciples spoke up, &amp;apos;But where will this happen, Lord?&amp;apos;</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="18">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Jesus told his disciples a story about how they should keep on praying and never give up: Think about what that crooked judge said. We are now on our way to Jerusalem. Everything that the prophets wrote about the Son of Man will happen there. &amp;apos;Lord, I want to see!&amp;apos; he answered.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">In a town there was once a judge who didn't fear God or care about people.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">In that same town there was a widow who kept going to the judge and saying, &amp;apos;Make sure that I get fair treatment in court.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">For a while the judge refused to do anything. Finally, he said to himself, &amp;apos;Even though I don't fear God or care about people,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">I will help this widow because she keeps on bothering me. If I don't help her, she will wear me out.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">The Lord said:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Won't God protect his chosen ones who pray to him day and night? Won't he be concerned for them?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">He will surely hurry and help them. But when the Son of Man comes, will he find on this earth anyone with faith?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Jesus told a story to some people who thought they were better than others and who looked down on everyone else:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Two men went into the temple to pray. One was a Pharisee and the other a tax collector.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">The Pharisee stood over by himself and prayed, &amp;apos;God, I thank you that I am not greedy, dishonest, and unfaithful in marriage like other people. And I am really glad that I am not like that tax collector over there.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">I go without eating for two days a week, and I give you one tenth of all I earn.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">The tax collector stood off at a distance and did not think he was good enough even to look up toward heaven. He was so sorry for what he had done that he pounded his chest and prayed, &amp;apos;God, have pity on me! I am such a sinner.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Then Jesus said, &amp;apos;When the two men went home, it was the tax collector and not the Pharisee who was pleasing to God. If you put yourself above others, you will be put down. But if you humble yourself, you will be honored.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Some people brought their little children for Jesus to bless. But when his disciples saw them doing this, they told the people to stop bothering him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">So Jesus called the children over to him and said, &amp;apos;Let the children come to me! Don't try to stop them. People who are like these children belong to God's kingdom.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">You will never get into God's kingdom unless you enter it like a child!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">An important man asked Jesus, &amp;apos;Good Teacher, what must I do to have eternal life?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Jesus said, &amp;apos;Why do you call me good? Only God is good.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">You know the commandments: &amp;quot;Be faithful in marriage. Do not murder. Do not steal. Do not tell lies about others. Respect your father and mother.&amp;quot; &amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">He told Jesus, &amp;apos;I have obeyed all these commandments since I was a young man.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">When Jesus heard this, he said, &amp;apos;There is one thing you still need to do. Go and sell everything you own! Give the money to the poor, and you will have riches in heaven. Then come and be my follower.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">When the man heard this, he was sad, because he was very rich.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">Jesus saw how sad the man was. So he said, &amp;apos;It's terribly hard for rich people to get into God's kingdom!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">In fact, it's easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to get into God's kingdom.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">When the crowd heard this, they asked, &amp;apos;How can anyone ever be saved?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">Jesus replied, &amp;apos;There are some things that people cannot do, but God can do anything.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">Peter said, &amp;apos;Remember, we left everything to be your followers!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">Jesus answered, &amp;apos;You can be sure that anyone who gives up home or wife or brothers or family or children because of God's kingdom</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">will be given much more in this life. And in the future world they will have eternal life.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">Jesus took the twelve apostles aside and said:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">He will be handed over to foreigners, who will make fun of him, mistreat him, and spit on him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">They will beat him and kill him, but three days later he will rise to life.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">The apostles did not understand what Jesus was talking about. They could not understand, because the meaning of what he said was hidden from them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">When Jesus was coming close to Jericho, a blind man sat begging beside the road.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">The man heard the crowd walking by and asked what was happening.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">Some people told him that Jesus from Nazareth was passing by.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">So the blind man shouted, &amp;apos;Jesus, Son of David, have pity on me!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">The people who were going along with Jesus told the man to be quiet. But he shouted even louder, &amp;apos;Son of David, have pity on me!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">Jesus stopped and told some people to bring the blind man over to him. When the blind man was getting near, Jesus asked,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">&amp;apos;What do you want me to do for you?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">Jesus replied, &amp;apos;Look and you will see! Your eyes are healed because of your faith.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43">At once the man could see, and he went with Jesus and started thanking God. When the crowds saw what happened, they praised God.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="19">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Jesus was going through Jericho,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">where a man named Zacchaeus lived. He was in charge of collecting taxes and was very rich.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">When Jesus got there, he looked up and said, &amp;apos;Zacchaeus, hurry down! I want to stay with you today.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Zacchaeus hurried down and gladly welcomed Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Everyone who saw this started grumbling, &amp;apos;This man Zacchaeus is a sinner! And Jesus is going home to eat with him.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Later that day Zacchaeus stood up and said to the Lord, &amp;apos;I will give half of my property to the poor. And I will now pay back four times as much to everyone I have ever cheated.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Jesus said to Zacchaeus, &amp;apos;Today you and your family have been saved, because you are a true son of Abraham.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">The Son of Man came to look for and to save people who are lost.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">The crowd was still listening to Jesus as he was getting close to Jerusalem. Many of them thought that God's kingdom would soon appear,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">and Jesus told them this story:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">But before leaving, he called in ten servants and gave each of them some money. He told them, &amp;apos;Use this to earn more money until I get back.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">But the people of his country hated him, and they sent messengers to the foreign country to say, &amp;apos;We don't want this man to be our king.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">After the prince had been made king, he returned and called in his servants. He asked them how much they had earned with the money they had been given.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">The first servant came and said, &amp;apos;Sir, with the money you gave me I have earned ten times as much.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">&amp;apos;That's fine, my good servant!&amp;apos; the king said. &amp;apos;Since you have shown that you can be trusted with a small amount, you will be given ten cities to rule.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">The second one came and said, &amp;apos;Sir, with the money you gave me, I have earned five times as much.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">The king said, &amp;apos;You will be given five cities.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Another servant came and said, &amp;apos;Sir, here is your money. I kept it safe in a handkerchief.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">You are a hard man, and I was afraid of you. You take what isn't yours, and you harvest crops you didn't plant.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">&amp;apos;You worthless servant!&amp;apos; the king told him. &amp;apos;You have condemned yourself by what you have just said. You knew I am a hard man, taking what isn't mine and harvesting what I've not planted.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">Why didn't you put my money in the bank? On my return, I could have had the money together with interest.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">Then he said to some other servants standing there, &amp;apos;Take the money away from him and give it to the servant who earned ten times as much.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">But they said, &amp;apos;Sir, he already has ten times as much!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">The king replied, &amp;apos;Those who have something will be given more. But everything will be taken away from those who don't have anything.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">Now bring me the enemies who didn't want me to be their king. Kill them while I watch!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">When Jesus had finished saying all this, he went on toward Jerusalem.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">As he was getting near Bethphage and Bethany on the Mount of Olives, he sent two of his disciples on ahead.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">He told them, &amp;apos;Go into the next village, where you will find a young donkey that has never been ridden. Untie the donkey and bring it here.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">If anyone asks why you are doing this, just say, &amp;quot;The Lord needs it.&amp;quot; &amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">They went off and found everything just as Jesus had said.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">While they were untying the donkey, its owners asked, &amp;apos;Why are you doing that?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">They answered, &amp;apos;The Lord needs it.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">Then they led the donkey to Jesus. They put some of their clothes on its back and helped Jesus get on.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">And as he rode along, the people spread clothes on the road in front of him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">When Jesus started down the Mount of Olives, his large crowd of disciples were happy and praised God because of all the miracles they had seen.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">They shouted,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">Some Pharisees in the crowd said to Jesus, &amp;apos;Teacher, make your disciples stop shouting!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">But Jesus answered, &amp;apos;If they keep quiet, these stones will start shouting.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">When Jesus came closer and could see Jerusalem, he cried</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">and said:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43">Jerusalem, the time will come when your enemies will build walls around you to attack you. Armies will surround you and close in on you from every side.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44">They will level you to the ground and kill your people. Not one stone in your buildings will be left on top of another. This will happen because you did not see that God had come to save you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45">When Jesus entered the temple, he started chasing out the people who were selling things.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46">He told them, &amp;apos;The Scriptures say, &amp;quot;My house should be a place of worship.&amp;quot; But you have made it a place where robbers hide!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="47">Each day, Jesus kept on teaching in the temple. So the chief priests, the teachers of the Law of Moses, and some other important people tried to have him killed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="48">But they could not find a way to do it, because everyone else was eager to listen to him.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="20">
			<VERS vnumber="1">One day, Jesus was teaching in the temple and telling the good news. So the chief priests, the teachers, and the nation's leaders</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">asked him, &amp;apos;What right do you have to do these things? Who gave you this authority?&amp;apos; A man once planted a vineyard and rented it out. Then he left the country for a long time. Jesus asked, &amp;apos;What do you think the owner of the vineyard will do? When the people heard this, they said, &amp;apos;This must never happen!&amp;apos; &amp;apos;The Emperor's,&amp;apos; they answered. Teacher, Moses wrote that if a married man dies and has no children, his brother should marry the widow. Their first son would then be thought of as the son of the dead brother. The people in this world get married. &amp;quot;The Lord said to my Lord, into a footstool for you.&amp;quot;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Jesus replied, &amp;apos;I want to ask you a question.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Who gave John the right to baptize? Was it God in heaven or merely some human being?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">They talked this over and said to each other, &amp;apos;We can't say God gave John this right. Jesus will ask us why we didn't believe John.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">And we can't say it was merely some human who gave John the right to baptize. The crowd will stone us to death, because they think John was a prophet.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">So they told Jesus, &amp;apos;We don't know who gave John the right to baptize.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Jesus replied, &amp;apos;Then I won't tell you who gave me the right to do what I do.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Jesus told the people this story:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">When it was time to harvest the crop, he sent a servant to ask the renters for his share of the grapes. But they beat up the servant and sent him away without anything.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">So the owner sent another servant. The renters also beat him up. They insulted him terribly and sent him away without a thing.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">The owner sent a third servant. He was also beaten terribly and thrown out of the vineyard.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">The owner then said to himself, &amp;apos;What am I going to do? I know what. I'll send my son, the one I love so much. They will surely respect him!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">When the renters saw the owner's son, they said to one another, &amp;apos;Someday he will own the vineyard. Let's kill him! Then we can have it all for ourselves.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">So they threw him out of the vineyard and killed him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">I'll tell you what. He will come and kill those renters and let someone else have his vineyard.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">But Jesus looked straight at them and said, &amp;apos;Then what do the Scriptures mean when they say, &amp;quot;The stone the builders tossed aside is now the most important stone of all&amp;quot;?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Anyone who stumbles over this stone will get hurt, and anyone it falls on will be smashed to pieces.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">The chief priests and the teachers of the Law of Moses knew that Jesus was talking about them when he was telling this story. They wanted to arrest him right then, but they were afraid of the people.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Jesus' enemies kept watching him closely, because they wanted to hand him over to the Roman governor. So they sent some men who pretended to be good. But they were really spies trying to catch Jesus saying something wrong.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">The spies said to him, &amp;apos;Teacher, we know you teach the truth about what God wants people to do. And you treat everyone with the same respect, no matter who they are.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Tell us, should we pay taxes to the Emperor or not?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">Jesus knew they were trying to trick him. So he told them,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">&amp;apos;Show me a coin.&amp;apos; Then he asked, &amp;apos;Whose picture and name are on it?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">Then he told them, &amp;apos;Give the Emperor what belongs to him and give God what belongs to God.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">Jesus' enemies could not catch him saying anything wrong there in front of the people. They were amazed at his answer and kept quiet.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">The Sadducees did not believe that people would rise to life after death. So some of them came to Jesus</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">and said:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">There were once seven brothers. The first one married, but died without having any children.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">The second one married his brother's widow, and he also died without having any children.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">The same thing happened to the third one. Finally, all seven brothers married this woman and died without having any children.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">At last the woman died.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">When God raises people from death, whose wife will this woman be? All seven brothers had married her.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">Jesus answered:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">But in the future world no one who is worthy to rise from death will either marry</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">or die. They will be like the angels and will be God's children, because they have been raised to life.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">In the story about the burning bush, Moses clearly shows that people will live again. He said, &amp;apos;The Lord is the God worshiped by Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">So the Lord isn't the God of the dead, but of the living. This means that everyone is alive as far as God is concerned.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">Some of the teachers of the Law of Moses said, &amp;apos;Teacher, you have given a good answer!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">From then on, no one dared to ask Jesus any questions.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">Jesus asked, &amp;apos;Why do people say that the Messiah will be the son of King David?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">In the book of Psalms, David himself says, Sit at my right side</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43">until I make your enemies</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44">David spoke of the Messiah as his Lord, so how can the Messiah be his son?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45">While everyone was listening to Jesus, he said to his disciples:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46">Guard against the teachers of the Law of Moses! They love to walk around in long robes, and they like to be greeted in the market. They want the front seats in the synagogues and the best seats at banquets.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="47">But they cheat widows out of their homes and then pray long prayers just to show off. These teachers will be punished most of all.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="21">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Jesus looked up and saw some rich people tossing their gifts into the offering box.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">He also saw a poor widow putting in a few cents.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">And he said, &amp;apos;I tell you that this poor woman has put in more than all the others.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Everyone else gave what they didn't need. But she is very poor and gave everything she had.&amp;apos; Don't be fooled by those who will come and claim to be me. They will say, &amp;apos;I am Christ!&amp;apos; and &amp;apos;Now is the time!&amp;apos; But don't follow them. When you see a fig tree or any other tree</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Some people were talking about the beautiful stones used to build the temple and about the gifts that had been placed in it. Jesus said,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">&amp;apos;Do you see these stones? The time is coming when not one of them will be left in place. They will all be knocked down.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Some people asked, &amp;apos;Teacher, when will all this happen? How can we know when these things are about to take place?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Jesus replied:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">When you hear about wars and riots, don't be afraid. These things will have to happen first, but this isn't the end.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Nations will go to war against one another, and kingdoms will attack each other.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">There will be great earthquakes, and in many places people will starve to death and suffer terrible diseases. All sorts of frightening things will be seen in the sky.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Before all this happens, you will be arrested and punished. You will be tried in your synagogues and put in jail. Because of me you will be placed on trial before kings and governors.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">But this will be your chance to tell about your faith.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Don't worry about what you will say to defend yourselves.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">I will give you the wisdom to know what to say. None of your enemies will be able to oppose you or to say that you are wrong.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">You will be betrayed by your own parents, brothers, family, and friends. Some of you will even be killed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Because of me, you will be hated by everyone.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">But don't worry!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">You will be saved by being faithful to me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">When you see Jerusalem surrounded by soldiers, you will know that it will soon be destroyed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">If you are living in Judea at this time, run to the mountains. If you are in the city, leave it. And if you are out in the country, don't go back into the city.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">This time of punishment is what is written about in the Scriptures.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">It will be an awful time for women who are expecting babies or nursing young children! Everywhere in the land people will suffer horribly and be punished.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">Some of them will be killed by swords. Others will be carried off to foreign countries. Jerusalem will be overrun by foreign nations until their time comes to an end.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">Strange things will happen to the sun, moon, and stars. The nations on earth will be afraid of the roaring sea and tides, and they won't know what to do.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">People will be so frightened that they will faint because of what is happening to the world. Every power in the sky will be shaken.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">Then the Son of Man will be seen, coming in a cloud with power and great glory.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">When all of this starts happening, stand up straight and be brave. You will soon be set free.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">Then Jesus told them a story:</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="37">Jesus taught in the temple each day, and he spent each night on the Mount of Olives.</VERS>

		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="22">
			<VERS vnumber="1">The Festival of Thin Bread, also called Passover, was near.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">The chief priests and the teachers of the Law of Moses were looking for a way to get rid of Jesus, because they were afraid of what the people might do.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Then Satan entered the heart of Judas Iscariot, who was one of the twelve apostles. &amp;apos;No!&amp;apos; they answered. &amp;apos;Enough of that!&amp;apos; Jesus replied. &amp;apos;No, I'm not!&amp;apos; Peter replied. Jesus replied, &amp;apos;If I said so, you wouldn't believe me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Judas went to talk with the chief priests and the officers of the temple police about how he could help them arrest Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">They were very pleased and offered to pay Judas some money.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">He agreed and started looking for a good chance to betray Jesus when the crowds were not around.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">The day had come for the Festival of Thin Bread, and it was time to kill the Passover lambs.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">So Jesus said to Peter and John, &amp;apos;Go and prepare the Passover meal for us to eat.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">But they asked, &amp;apos;Where do you want us to prepare it?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Jesus told them, &amp;apos;As you go into the city, you will meet a man carrying a jar of water. Follow him into the house</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">and say to the owner, &amp;quot;Our teacher wants to know where he can eat the Passover meal with his disciples.&amp;quot;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">The owner will take you upstairs and show you a large room ready for you to use. Prepare the meal there.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Peter and John left. They found everything just as Jesus had told them, and they prepared the Passover meal.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">When the time came for Jesus and the apostles to eat,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">he said to them, &amp;apos;I have very much wanted to eat this Passover meal with you before I suffer.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">I tell you I will not eat another Passover meal until it is finally eaten in God's kingdom.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Jesus took a cup of wine in his hands and gave thanks to God. Then he told the apostles, &amp;apos;Take this wine and share it with each other.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">I tell you that I will not drink any more wine until God's kingdom comes.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Jesus took some bread in his hands and gave thanks for it. He broke the bread and handed it to his apostles. Then he said, &amp;apos;This is my body, which is given for you. Eat this as a way of remembering me!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">After the meal he took another cup of wine in his hands. Then he said, &amp;apos;This is my blood. It is poured out for you, and with it God makes his new agreement.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">The one who will betray me is here at the table with me!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">The Son of Man will die in the way that has been decided for him, but it will be terrible for the one who betrays him!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">Then the apostles started arguing about who would ever do such a thing.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">The apostles got into an argument about which one of them was the greatest.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">So Jesus told them: Foreign kings order their people around, and powerful rulers call themselves everyone's friends. Jesus answered, &amp;apos;You say I am!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">But don't be like them. The most important one of you should be like the least important, and your leader should be like a servant.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">Who do people think is the greatest, a person who is served or one who serves? Isn't it the one who is served? But I have been with you as a servant.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">You have stayed with me in all my troubles.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">So I will give you the right to rule as kings, just as my Father has given me the right to rule as a king.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">You will eat and drink with me in my kingdom, and you will each sit on a throne to judge the twelve tribes of Israel.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">Jesus said, &amp;apos;Simon, listen to me! Satan has demanded the right to test each one of you, as a farmer does when he separates wheat from the husks.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">But Simon, I have prayed that your faith will be strong. And when you have come back to me, help the others.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">Peter said, &amp;apos;Lord, I am ready to go with you to jail and even to die with you.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">Jesus replied, &amp;apos;Peter, I tell you that before a rooster crows tomorrow morning, you will say three times that you don't know me.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">Jesus asked his disciples, &amp;apos;When I sent you out without a moneybag or a traveling bag or sandals, did you need anything?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">Jesus told them, &amp;apos;But now, if you have a moneybag, take it with you. Also take a traveling bag, and if you don't have a sword, sell some of your clothes and buy one.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">Do this because the Scriptures say, &amp;quot;He was considered a criminal.&amp;quot; This was written about me, and it will soon come true.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">The disciples said, &amp;apos;Lord, here are two swords!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">Jesus went out to the Mount of Olives, as he often did, and his disciples went with him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">When they got there, he told them, &amp;apos;Pray that you won't be tested.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">Jesus walked on a little way before he knelt down and prayed,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">&amp;apos;Father, if you will, please don't make me suffer by drinking from this cup. But do what you want, and not what I want.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43">Then an angel from heaven came to help him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44">Jesus was in great pain and prayed so sincerely that his sweat fell to the ground like drops of blood.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45">Jesus got up from praying and went over to his disciples. They were asleep and worn out from being so sad.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46">He said to them, &amp;apos;Why are you asleep? Wake up and pray that you won't be tested.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="47">While Jesus was still speaking, a crowd came up. It was led by Judas, one of the twelve apostles. He went over to Jesus and greeted him with a kiss.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="48">Jesus asked Judas, &amp;apos;Are you betraying the Son of Man with a kiss?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="49">When Jesus' disciples saw what was about to happen, they asked, &amp;apos;Lord, should we attack them with a sword?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="50">One of the disciples even struck at the high priest's servant with his sword and cut off the servant's right ear.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="51">&amp;apos;Enough of that!&amp;apos; Jesus said. Then he touched the servant's ear and healed it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="52">Jesus spoke to the chief priests, the temple police, and the leaders who had come to arrest him. He said, &amp;apos;Why do you come out with swords and clubs and treat me like a criminal?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="53">I was with you every day in the temple, and you didn't arrest me. But this is your time, and darkness is in control.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="54">Jesus was arrested and led away to the house of the high priest, while Peter followed at a distance.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="55">Some people built a fire in the middle of the courtyard and were sitting around it. Peter sat there with them,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="56">and a servant girl saw him. Then after she had looked at him carefully, she said, &amp;apos;This man was with Jesus!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="57">Peter said, &amp;apos;Woman, I don't even know that man!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="58">A little later someone else saw Peter and said, &amp;apos;You are one of them!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="59">About an hour later another man insisted, &amp;apos;This man must have been with Jesus. They both come from Galilee.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="60">Peter replied, &amp;apos;I don't know what you are talking about!&amp;apos; Right then, while Peter was still speaking, a rooster crowed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="61">The Lord turned and looked at Peter. And Peter remembered that the Lord had said, &amp;apos;Before a rooster crows tomorrow morning, you will say three times that you don't know me.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="62">Then Peter went out and cried bitterly.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="63">The men who were guarding Jesus made fun of him and beat him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="64">They put a blindfold on him and said, &amp;apos;Tell us who struck you!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="65">They kept on insulting Jesus in many other ways.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="66">At daybreak the nation's leaders, the chief priests, and the teachers of the Law of Moses got together and brought Jesus before their council.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="67">They said, &amp;apos;Tell us! Are you the Messiah?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="68">And if I asked you a question, you wouldn't answer.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="69">But from now on, the Son of Man will be seated at the right side of God All-Powerful.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="70">Then they asked, &amp;apos;Are you the Son of God?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="71">They replied, &amp;apos;Why do we need more witnesses? He said it himself!&amp;apos;</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="23">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Everyone in the council got up and led Jesus off to Pilate.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">They started accusing him and said, &amp;apos;We caught this man trying to get our people to riot and to stop paying taxes to the Emperor. He also claims that he is the Messiah, our king.&amp;apos; &amp;apos;Those are your words,&amp;apos; Jesus answered. Women of Jerusalem, don't cry for me! Cry for yourselves and for your children. While the crowd stood there watching Jesus, the soldiers gambled for his clothes. The leaders insulted him by saying, &amp;apos;He saved others. Now he should save himself, if he really is God's chosen Messiah!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Pilate asked Jesus, &amp;apos;Are you the king of the Jews?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Pilate told the chief priests and the crowd, &amp;apos;I don't find him guilty of anything.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">But they all kept on saying, &amp;apos;He has been teaching and causing trouble all over Judea. He started in Galilee and has now come all the way here.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">When Pilate heard this, he asked, &amp;apos;Is this man from Galilee?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">After Pilate learned that Jesus came from the region ruled by Herod, he sent him to Herod, who was in Jerusalem at that time.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">For a long time Herod had wanted to see Jesus and was very happy because he finally had this chance. He had heard many things about Jesus and hoped to see him work a miracle.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Herod asked him a lot of questions, but Jesus did not answer.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Then the chief priests and the teachers of the Law of Moses stood up and accused him of all kinds of bad things.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Herod and his soldiers made fun of Jesus and insulted him. They put a fine robe on him and sent him back to Pilate.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">That same day Herod and Pilate became friends, even though they had been enemies before this.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Pilate called together the chief priests, the leaders, and the people.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">He told them, &amp;apos;You brought Jesus to me and said he was a troublemaker. But I have questioned him here in front of you, and I have not found him guilty of anything that you say he has done.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Herod didn't find him guilty either and sent him back. This man doesn't deserve to be put to death!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">But the whole crowd shouted, &amp;apos;Kill Jesus! Give us Barabbas!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Now Barabbas was in jail because he had started a riot in the city and had murdered someone.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Pilate wanted to set Jesus free, so he spoke again to the crowds.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">But they kept shouting, &amp;apos;Nail him to a cross! Nail him to a cross!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Pilate spoke to them a third time, &amp;apos;But what crime has he done? I have not found him guilty of anything for which he should be put to death. I will have him beaten with a whip and set free.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">The people kept on shouting as loud as they could for Jesus to be put to death.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">Finally, Pilate gave in.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">He freed the man who was in jail for rioting and murder, because he was the one the crowd wanted to be set free. Then Pilate handed Jesus over for them to do what they wanted with him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">As Jesus was being led away, some soldiers grabbed hold of a man named Simon who was from Cyrene. He was coming in from the fields, but they put the cross on him and made him carry it behind Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">A large crowd was following Jesus, and in the crowd a lot of women were crying and weeping for him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">Jesus turned to the women and said:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">Someday people will say, &amp;apos;Women who never had children are really fortunate!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">At that time everyone will say to the mountains, &amp;apos;Fall on us!&amp;apos; They will say to the hills, &amp;apos;Hide us!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">If this can happen when the wood is green, what do you think will happen when it is dry?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">Two criminals were led out to be put to death with Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">When the soldiers came to the place called &amp;apos;The Skull,&amp;apos; they nailed Jesus to a cross. They also nailed the two criminals to crosses, one on each side of Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">The soldiers made fun of Jesus and brought him some wine.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">They said, &amp;apos;If you are the king of the Jews, save yourself!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">Above him was a sign that said, &amp;apos;This is the King of the Jews.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">One of the criminals hanging there also insulted Jesus by saying, &amp;apos;Aren't you the Messiah? Save yourself and save us!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">But the other criminal told the first one off, &amp;apos;Don't you fear God? Aren't you getting the same punishment as this man?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">We got what was coming to us, but he didn't do anything wrong.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">Then he said to Jesus, &amp;apos;Remember me when you come into power!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43">Jesus replied, &amp;apos;I promise that today you will be with me in paradise.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44">Around noon the sky turned dark and stayed that way until the middle of the afternoon.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45">The sun stopped shining, and the curtain in the temple split down the middle.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46">Jesus shouted, &amp;apos;Father, I put myself in your hands!&amp;apos; Then he died.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="47">When the Roman officer saw what had happened, he praised God and said, &amp;apos;Jesus must really have been a good man!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="48">A crowd had gathered to see the terrible sight. Then after they had seen it, they felt brokenhearted and went home.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="49">All of Jesus' close friends and the women who had come with him from Galilee stood at a distance and watched.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="52">Joseph went to Pilate and asked for Jesus' body.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="53">He took the body down from the cross and wrapped it in fine cloth. Then he put it in a tomb that had been cut out of solid rock and had never been used.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="54">It was Friday, and the Sabbath was about to begin.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="55">The women who had come with Jesus from Galilee followed Joseph and watched how Jesus' body was placed in the tomb.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="56">Then they went to prepare some sweet-smelling spices for his burial. But on the Sabbath they rested, as the Law of Moses commands.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="24">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Very early on Sunday morning the women went to the tomb, carrying the spices they had prepared.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">When they found the stone rolled away from the entrance,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">they went in. But they did not find the body of the Lord Jesus,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">and they did not know what to think. Suddenly two men in shining white clothes stood beside them. The two of them stood there looking sad and gloomy. They answered: Those things that happened to Jesus from Nazareth. By what he did and said he showed that he was a powerful prophet, who pleased God and all the people. The two disciples found the eleven apostles and the others gathered together. The Scriptures say that the Messiah must suffer, then three days later he will rise from death.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">The women were afraid and bowed to the ground. But the men said, &amp;apos;Why are you looking in the place of the dead for someone who is alive?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Jesus isn't here! He has been raised from death. Remember that while he was still in Galilee, he told you,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">&amp;quot;The Son of Man will be handed over to sinners who will nail him to a cross. But three days later he will rise to life.&amp;quot; &amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Then they remembered what Jesus had said.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">The apostles thought it was all nonsense, and they would not believe.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">But Peter ran to the tomb. And when he stooped down and looked in, he saw only the burial clothes. Then he returned, wondering what had happened.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">That same day two of Jesus' disciples were going to the village of Emmaus, which was about eleven kilometers from Jerusalem.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">As they were talking and thinking about what had happened,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Jesus came near and started walking along beside them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">But they did not know who he was.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Jesus asked them, &amp;apos;What were you talking about as you walked along?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Then the one named Cleopas asked Jesus, &amp;apos;Are you the only person from Jerusalem who didn't know what was happening there these last few days?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">&amp;apos;What do you mean?&amp;apos; Jesus asked.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Then the chief priests and our leaders had him arrested and sentenced to die on a cross.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">We had hoped that he would be the one to set Israel free! But it has already been three days since all this happened.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Some women in our group surprised us. They had gone to the tomb early in the morning,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">but did not find the body of Jesus. They came back, saying they had seen a vision of angels who told them that he is alive.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">Some men from our group went to the tomb and found it just as the women had said. But they didn't see Jesus either.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">Then Jesus asked the two disciples, &amp;apos;Why can't you understand? How can you be so slow to believe all that the prophets said?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">Didn't you know that the Messiah would have to suffer before he was given his glory?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">Jesus then explained everything written about himself in the Scriptures, beginning with the Law of Moses and the Books of the Prophets.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">When the two of them came near the village where they were going, Jesus seemed to be going farther.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">They begged him, &amp;apos;Stay with us! It's already late, and the sun is going down.&amp;apos; So Jesus went into the house to stay with them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">After Jesus sat down to eat, he took some bread. He blessed it and broke it. Then he gave it to them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">At once they knew who he was, but he disappeared.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">They said to each other, &amp;apos;When he talked with us along the road and explained the Scriptures to us, didn't it warm our hearts?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">So they got up and returned to Jerusalem.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">And they learned from the group that the Lord was really alive and had appeared to Peter.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">Then the disciples from Emmaus told what happened on the road and how they knew he was the Lord when he broke the bread.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">While Jesus' disciples were talking about what had happened, Jesus appeared and greeted them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">They were frightened and terrified because they thought they were seeing a ghost.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">But Jesus said, &amp;apos;Why are you so frightened? Why do you doubt?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">Look at my hands and my feet and see who I am! Touch me and find out for yourselves. Ghosts don't have flesh and bones as you see I have.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">After Jesus said this, he showed them his hands and his feet.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">The disciples were so glad and amazed that they could not believe it. Jesus then asked them, &amp;apos;Do you have something to eat?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">They gave him a piece of broiled fish.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43">He took it and ate it as they watched.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44">Jesus said to them, &amp;apos;While I was still with you, I told you that everything written about me in the Law of Moses, the Books of the Prophets, and in the Psalms had to happen.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45">Then he helped them understand the Scriptures.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46">He told them:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="47">They also say that all people of every nation must be told in my name to turn to God, in order to be forgiven. So beginning in Jerusalem,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="48">you must tell everything that has happened.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="49">I will send you the one my Father has promised, but you must stay in the city until you are given power from heaven.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="50">Jesus led his disciples out to Bethany, where he raised his hands and blessed them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="51">As he was doing this, he left and was taken up to heaven.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="52">After his disciples had worshiped him, they returned to Jerusalem and were very happy.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="53">They spent their time in the temple, praising God.</VERS>

He came only to tell about the light. on everyone was coming into the world. but no one knew him, though God had made the world with his Word. but his own nation did not welcome him. and put their faith in him. So he gave them the right to be the children of God. by nature or because of any human desires. God himself was the one who made them his children. a human being and lived here with us. We saw his true glory, the glory of the only Son of the Father. From him the complete gifts of undeserved grace and truth have come down to us. Here is the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world! They answered, &amp;apos;Rabbi, where do you live?&amp;apos; The Hebrew word &amp;apos;Rabbi&amp;apos; means &amp;apos;Teacher.&amp;apos; Philip answered, &amp;apos;Come and see.&amp;apos; Jesus answered, &amp;apos;Before Philip called you, I saw you under the fig tree.&amp;apos;</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="22">Finally, they said, &amp;apos;Who are you then? We have to give an answer to the ones who sent us. Tell us who you are!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">John answered in the words of the prophet Isaiah, &amp;apos;I am only someone shouting in the desert, &amp;quot;Get the road ready for the Lord!&amp;quot; &amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">Some Pharisees had also been sent to John.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">They asked him, &amp;apos;Why are you baptizing people, if you are not the Messiah or Elijah or the Prophet?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">John told them, &amp;apos;I use water to baptize people. But here with you is someone you don't know.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">Even though I came first, I am not good enough to untie his sandals.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">John said this as he was baptizing east of the Jordan River in Bethany.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">The next day, John saw Jesus coming toward him and said:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">He is the one I told you about when I said, &amp;apos;Someone else will come, who is greater than I am, because he was alive before I was born.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">I didn't know who he was. But I came to baptize you with water, so that everyone in Israel would see him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">I was there and saw the Spirit come down on him like a dove from heaven. And the Spirit stayed on him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">Before this I didn't know who he was. But the one who sent me to baptize with water had told me, &amp;apos;You will see the Spirit come down and stay on someone. Then you will know that he is the one who will baptize with the Holy Spirit.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">I saw this happen, and I tell you that he is the Son of God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">The next day, John was there again, and two of his followers were with him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">When he saw Jesus walking by, he said, &amp;apos;Here is the Lamb of God!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">John's two followers heard him, and they went with Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">When Jesus turned and saw them, he asked, &amp;apos;What do you want?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">Jesus replied, &amp;apos;Come and see!&amp;apos; It was already about four o'clock in the afternoon when they went with him and saw where he lived. So they stayed on for the rest of the day.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">One of the two men who had heard John and had gone with Jesus was Andrew, the brother of Simon Peter.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">The first thing Andrew did was to find his brother and tell him, &amp;apos;We have found the Messiah!&amp;apos; The Hebrew word &amp;apos;Messiah&amp;apos; means the same as the Greek word &amp;apos;Christ.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">Andrew brought his brother to Jesus. And when Jesus saw him, he said, &amp;apos;Simon son of John, you will be called Cephas.&amp;apos; This name can be translated as &amp;apos;Peter.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45">Philip then found Nathanael and said, &amp;apos;We have found the one that Moses and the Prophets wrote about. He is Jesus, the son of Joseph from Nazareth.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46">Nathanael asked, &amp;apos;Can anything good come from Nazareth?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="47">When Jesus saw Nathanael coming toward him, he said, &amp;apos;Here is a true descendant of our ancestor Israel. And he isn't deceitful.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="48">&amp;apos;How do you know me?&amp;apos; Nathanael asked.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="49">Nathanael said, &amp;apos;Rabbi, you are the Son of God and the King of Israel!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="50">Jesus answered, &amp;apos;Did you believe me just because I said that I saw you under the fig tree? You will see something even greater.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="51">I tell you for certain you will see heaven open and God's angels going up and coming down on the Son of Man.&amp;apos;</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="2">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Three days later Mary, the mother of Jesus, was at a wedding feast in the village of Cana in Galilee.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Jesus and his disciples had also been invited and were there. The servants did as Jesus told them,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">When the wine was all gone, Mary said to Jesus, &amp;apos;They don't have any more wine.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Jesus replied, &amp;apos;Mother, my time hasn't yet come! You must not tell me what to do.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Mary then said to the servants, &amp;apos;Do whatever Jesus tells you to do.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">At the feast there were six stone water jars that were used by the people for washing themselves in the way that their religion said they must. Each jar held about 100 liters.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Jesus told the servants to fill them to the top with water. Then after the jars had been filled,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">he said, &amp;apos;Now take some water and give it to the man in charge of the feast.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">and the man in charge drank some of the water that had now turned into wine. He did not know where the wine had come from, but the servants did. He called the bridegroom over</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">and said, &amp;apos;The best wine is always served first. Then after the guests have had plenty, the other wine is served. But you have kept the best until last!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">This was Jesus' first miracle, and he did it in the village of Cana in Galilee. There Jesus showed his glory, and his disciples put their faith in him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">After this, he went with his mother, his brothers, and his disciples to the town of Capernaum, where they stayed for a few days.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Not long before the Jewish festival of Passover, Jesus went to Jerusalem.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">There he found people selling cattle, sheep, and doves in the temple. He also saw moneychangers sitting at their tables.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">So he took some rope and made a whip. Then he chased everyone out of the temple, together with their sheep and cattle. He turned over the tables of the moneychangers and scattered their coins.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Jesus said to the people who had been selling doves, &amp;apos;Get those doves out of here! Don't make my Father's house a marketplace.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">The disciples then remembered that the Scriptures say, &amp;apos;My love for your house burns in me like a fire.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">The Jewish leaders asked Jesus, &amp;apos;What miracle will you work to show us why you have done this?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">&amp;apos;Destroy this temple,&amp;apos; Jesus answered, &amp;apos;and in three days I will build it again!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">The leaders replied, &amp;apos;It took 46 years to build this temple. What makes you think you can rebuild it in three days?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">But Jesus was talking about his body as a temple.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">And when he was raised from death, his disciples remembered what he had told them. Then they believed the Scriptures and the words of Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">In Jerusalem during Passover many people put their faith in Jesus, because they saw him work miracles.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">But Jesus knew what was in their hearts, and he would not let them have power over him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">No one had to tell him what people were like. He already knew.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="3">
			<VERS vnumber="1">There was a man named Nicodemus who was a Pharisee and a Jewish leader.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">One night he went to Jesus and said, &amp;apos;Rabbi, we know that God has sent you to teach us. You could not work these miracles, unless God were with you.&amp;apos; I tell you for certain that before you can get into God's kingdom, you must be born not only by water, but by the Spirit. How can you be a teacher of Israel and not know these things? No one can do anything unless God in heaven allows it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Jesus replied, &amp;apos;I tell you for certain that you must be born from above before you can see God's kingdom!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Nicodemus asked, &amp;apos;How can a grown man ever be born a second time?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Jesus answered:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Humans give life to their children. Yet only God's Spirit can change you into a child of God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Don't be surprised when I say that you must be born from above.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Only God's Spirit gives new life. The Spirit is like the wind that blows wherever it wants to. You can hear the wind, but you don't know where it comes from or where it is going.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">&amp;apos;How can this be?&amp;apos; Nicodemus asked.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Jesus replied:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">I tell you for certain we know what we are talking about because we have seen it ourselves. But none of you will accept what we say.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">If you don't believe when I talk to you about things on earth, how can you possibly believe if I talk to you about things in heaven?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">No one has gone up to heaven except the Son of Man, who came down from there.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">And the Son of Man must be lifted up, just as the metal snake was lifted up by Moses in the desert.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Then everyone who has faith in the Son of Man will have eternal life.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">God loved the people of this world so much that he gave his only Son, so that everyone who has faith in him will have eternal life and never really die.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">God did not send his Son into the world to condemn its people. He sent him to save them!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">No one who has faith in God's Son will be condemned. But everyone who doesn't have faith in him has already been condemned for not having faith in God's only Son.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">The light has come into the world, and people who do evil things are judged guilty because they love the dark more than the light.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">People who do evil hate the light and won't come to the light, because it clearly shows what they have done.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">But everyone who lives by the truth will come to the light, because they want others to know that God is really the one doing what they do.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Later, Jesus and his disciples went to Judea, where he stayed with them for a while and was baptizing people.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">John's followers got into an argument with a Jewish man about a ceremony of washing.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">They went to John and said, &amp;apos;Rabbi, you spoke about a man when you were with him east of the Jordan. He is now baptizing people, and everyone is going to him.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">John replied:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">You surely remember how I told you that I am not the Messiah. I am only the one sent ahead of him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">At a wedding the groom is the one who gets married. The best man is glad just to be there and to hear the groom's voice. That's why I am so glad.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">Jesus must become more important, while I become less important.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">God's Son comes from heaven and is above all others. Everyone who comes from the earth belongs to the earth and speaks about earthly things. The one who comes from heaven is above all others.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">He speaks about what he has seen and heard, and yet no one believes him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">But everyone who does believe him has shown that God is truthful.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">The Son was sent to speak God's message, and he has been given the full power of God's Spirit.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">The Father loves the Son and has given him everything.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">Everyone who has faith in the Son has eternal life. But no one who rejects him will ever share in that life, and God will be angry with them forever.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="4">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Jesus knew that the Pharisees had heard that he was winning and baptizing more followers than John was.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">But Jesus' disciples were really the ones doing the baptizing, and not Jesus himself. Jesus asked her, &amp;apos;Would you please give me a drink of water?&amp;apos; &amp;apos;That's right,&amp;apos; Jesus replied, &amp;apos;you're telling the truth. You don't have a husband. You have already been married five times, and the man you are now living with isn't your husband.&amp;apos; Believe me, the time is coming when you won't worship the Father either on this mountain or in Jerusalem. My food is to do what God wants! He is the one who sent me, and I must finish the work that he gave me to do.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Jesus left Judea and started for Galilee again.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">This time he had to go through Samaria,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">and on his way he came to the town of Sychar. It was near the field that Jacob had long ago given to his son Joseph.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">&amp;apos;You are a Jew,&amp;apos; she replied, &amp;apos;and I am a Samaritan woman. How can you ask me for a drink of water when Jews and Samaritans won't have anything to do with each other?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Jesus answered, &amp;apos;You don't know what God wants to give you, and you don't know who is asking you for a drink. If you did, you would ask me for the water that gives life.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">&amp;apos;Sir,&amp;apos; the woman said, &amp;apos;you don't even have a bucket, and the well is deep. Where are you going to get this life-giving water?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Our ancestor Jacob dug this well for us, and his family and animals got water from it. Are you greater than Jacob?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Jesus answered, &amp;apos;Everyone who drinks this water will get thirsty again.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">But no one who drinks the water I give will ever be thirsty again. The water I give will become in that person a flowing fountain that gives eternal life.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">The woman replied, &amp;apos;Sir, please give me a drink of that water! Then I won't get thirsty and have to come to this well again.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Jesus told her, &amp;apos;Go and bring your husband.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">The woman said, &amp;apos;Sir, I can see that you are a prophet.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">My ancestors worshiped on this mountain, but you Jews say Jerusalem is the only place to worship.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Jesus said to her:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">You Samaritans don't really know the one you worship. But we Jews do know the God we worship, and by using us, God will save the world.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">But a time is coming, and it is already here! Even now the true worshipers are being led by the Spirit to worship the Father according to the truth. These are the ones the Father is seeking to worship him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">God is Spirit, and those who worship God must be led by the Spirit to worship him according to the truth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">The woman said, &amp;apos;I know that the Messiah will come. He is the one we call Christ. When he comes, he will explain everything to us.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">&amp;apos;I am that one,&amp;apos; Jesus told her, &amp;apos;and I am speaking to you now.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">The disciples returned about this time and were surprised to find Jesus talking with a woman. But none of them asked him what he wanted or why he was talking with her.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">The woman left her water jar and ran back into town, where she said to the people,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">&amp;apos;Come and see a man who told me everything I have ever done! Could he be the Messiah?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">Everyone in town went out to see Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">While this was happening, Jesus' disciples were saying to him, &amp;apos;Teacher, please eat something.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">But Jesus told them, &amp;apos;I have food you don't know anything about.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">His disciples started asking each other, &amp;apos;Has someone brought him something to eat?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">Jesus said:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">You may say there are still four months until harvest time. But I tell you to look, and you will see that the fields are ripe and ready to harvest.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">Even now the harvest workers are receiving their reward by gathering a harvest that brings eternal life. Then everyone who planted the seed and everyone who harvests the crop will celebrate together.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">So the saying proves true, &amp;apos;Some plant the seed, and others harvest the crop.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">I am sending you to harvest crops in fields where others have done all the hard work.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">A lot of Samaritans in that town put their faith in Jesus because the woman had said, &amp;apos;This man told me everything I have ever done.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">They came and asked him to stay in their town, and he stayed on for two days.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">Many more Samaritans put their faith in Jesus because of what they heard him say.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">They told the woman, &amp;apos;We no longer have faith in Jesus just because of what you told us. We have heard him ourselves, and we are certain that he is the Savior of the world!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45">and went to Galilee. The people there welcomed him, because they had gone to the festival in Jerusalem and had seen everything he had done.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46">While Jesus was in Galilee, he returned to the village of Cana, where he had turned the water into wine. There was an official in Capernaum whose son was sick.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="47">And when the man heard that Jesus had come from Judea, he went and begged him to keep his son from dying.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="48">Jesus told the official, &amp;apos;You won't have faith unless you see miracles and wonders!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="49">The man replied, &amp;apos;Lord, please come before my son dies!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="50">Jesus then said, &amp;apos;Your son will live. Go on home to him.&amp;apos; The man believed Jesus and started back home.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="51">Some of the official's servants met him along the road and told him, &amp;apos;Your son is better!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="52">He asked them when the boy got better, and they answered, &amp;apos;The fever left him yesterday at one o'clock.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="53">The boy's father realized that at one o'clock the day before, Jesus had told him, &amp;apos;Your son will live!&amp;apos; So the man and everyone in his family put their faith in Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="54">This was the second miracle that Jesus worked after he left Judea and went to Galilee.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="5">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Later, Jesus went to Jerusalem for another Jewish festival.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">In the city near the sheep gate was a pool with five porches, and its name in Hebrew was Bethzatha. I tell you for certain the Son cannot do anything on his own. He can do only what he sees the Father doing, and he does exactly what he sees the Father do.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Beside the pool was a man who had been sick for 38 years.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">When Jesus saw the man and realized that he had been crippled for a long time, he asked him, &amp;apos;Do you want to be healed?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">The man answered, &amp;apos;Sir, I don't have anyone to put me in the pool when the water is stirred up. I try to get in, but someone else always gets there first.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Jesus told him, &amp;apos;Pick up your mat and walk!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Right then the man was healed. He picked up his mat and started walking around. The day on which this happened was a Sabbath.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">When the Jewish leaders saw the man carrying his mat, they said to him, &amp;apos;This is the Sabbath! No one is allowed to carry a mat on the Sabbath.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">But he replied, &amp;apos;The man who healed me told me to pick up my mat and walk.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">They asked him, &amp;apos;Who is this man that told you to pick up your mat and walk?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">But he did not know who Jesus was, and Jesus had left because of the crowd.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Later, Jesus met the man in the temple and told him, &amp;apos;You are now well. But don't sin anymore or something worse might happen to you.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">The man left and told the leaders that Jesus was the one who had healed him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">They started making a lot of trouble for Jesus because he did things like this on the Sabbath.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">But Jesus said, &amp;apos;My Father has never stopped working, and this is why I keep on working.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Now the leaders wanted to kill Jesus for two reasons. First, he had broken the law of the Sabbath. But even worse, he had said God was his Father, which made him equal with God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Jesus told the people:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">The Father loves the Son and has shown him everything he does. The Father will show him even greater things, and you will be amazed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Just as the Father raises the dead and gives life, so the Son gives life to anyone he wants to.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">The Father doesn't judge anyone, but he has made his Son the judge of everyone.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">The Father wants all people to honor the Son as much as they honor him. When anyone refuses to honor the Son, this is the same as refusing to honor the Father who sent him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">I tell you for certain that everyone who hears my message and has faith in the one who sent me has eternal life and will never be condemned. They have already gone from death to life.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">I tell you for certain the time will come, and it is already here, when all of the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God. And those who listen to it will live!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">The Father has the power to give life, and he has given that same power to the Son.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">And he has given his Son the right to judge everyone, because he is the Son of Man.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">Don't be surprised! The time will come when all of the dead will hear the voice of the Son of Man,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">and they will come out of their graves. Everyone who has done good things will rise to life, but everyone who has done evil things will rise and be condemned.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">I cannot do anything on my own. The Father sent me, and he is the one who told me how to judge. I judge with fairness, because I obey him, and I don't just try to please myself.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">If I speak for myself, there is no way to prove I am telling the truth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">But there is someone else who speaks for me, and I know what he says is true.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">You sent messengers to John, and he told them the truth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">I don't depend on what people say about me, but I tell you these things so that you may be saved.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">John was a lamp that gave a lot of light, and you were glad to enjoy his light for a while.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">But something more important than John speaks for me. I mean the things that the Father has given me to do! All of these speak for me and prove that the Father sent me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">The Father who sent me also speaks for me, but you have never heard his voice or seen him face to face.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">You have not believed his message, because you refused to have faith in the one he sent.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">You search the Scriptures, because you think you will find eternal life in them. The Scriptures tell about me,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">but you refuse to come to me for eternal life.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">I don't care about human praise,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">but I do know that none of you love God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43">I have come with my Father's authority, and you have not welcomed me. But you will welcome people who come on their own.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44">How could you possibly believe? You like to have your friends praise you, and you don't care about praise that the only God can give!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45">Don't think that I will be the one to accuse you to the Father. You have put your hope in Moses, yet he is the very one who will accuse you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46">Moses wrote about me, and if you had believed Moses, you would have believed me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="47">But if you don't believe what Moses wrote, how can you believe what I say?</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="6">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Jesus crossed Lake Galilee, which was also known as Lake Tiberias.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">A large crowd had seen him work miracles to heal the sick, and those people went with him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">When Jesus saw the large crowd coming toward him, he asked Philip, &amp;apos;Where will we get enough food to feed all these people?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">He said this to test Philip, since he already knew what he was going to do.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Philip answered, &amp;apos;Don't you know that it would take almost a year's wages just to buy only a little bread for each of these people?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Andrew, the brother of Simon Peter, was one of the disciples. He spoke up and said,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">&amp;apos;There is a boy here who has five small loaves of barley bread and two fish. But what good is that with all these people?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">The ground was covered with grass, and Jesus told his disciples to tell everyone to sit down. About 5,000 men were in the crowd.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Jesus took the bread in his hands and gave thanks to God. Then he passed the bread to the people, and he did the same with the fish, until everyone had plenty to eat.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">The people ate all they wanted, and Jesus told his disciples to gather up the leftovers, so that nothing would be wasted.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">The disciples gathered them up and filled twelve large baskets with what was left over from the five barley loaves.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">After the people had seen Jesus work this miracle, they began saying, &amp;apos;This must be the Prophet who is to come into the world!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Jesus realized that they would try to force him to be their king. So he went up on a mountain, where he could be alone.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">That evening, Jesus' disciples went down to the lake.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">They got into a boat and started across for Capernaum. Later that evening Jesus had still not come to them,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">and a strong wind was making the water rough.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">When the disciples had rowed for five or six kilometers, they saw Jesus walking on the water. He kept coming closer to the boat, and they were terrified.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">But he said, &amp;apos;I am Jesus! Don't be afraid!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">The disciples wanted to take him into the boat, but suddenly the boat reached the shore where they were headed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">The people who had stayed on the east side of the lake knew that only one boat had been there. They also knew that Jesus had not left in it with his disciples. But the next day</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">some boats from Tiberias sailed near the place where the crowd had eaten the bread for which the Lord had given thanks.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">They saw that Jesus and his disciples had left. Then they got into the boats and went to Capernaum to look for Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">They found him on the west side of the lake and asked, &amp;apos;Rabbi, when did you get here?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">Jesus answered, &amp;apos;I tell you for certain that you are not looking for me because you saw the miracles, but because you ate all the food you wanted.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">Don't work for food that spoils. Work for food that gives eternal life. The Son of Man will give you this food, because God the Father has given him the right to do so.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">&amp;apos;What exactly does God want us to do?&amp;apos; the people asked.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">Jesus answered, &amp;apos;God wants you to have faith in the one he sent.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">They replied, &amp;apos;What miracle will you work, so that we can have faith in you? What will you do?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">For example, when our ancestors were in the desert, they were given manna to eat. It happened just as the Scriptures say, &amp;quot;God gave them bread from heaven to eat.&amp;quot; &amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">Jesus then told them, &amp;apos;I tell you for certain that Moses wasn't the one who gave you bread from heaven. My Father is the one who gives you the true bread from heaven.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">And the bread that God gives is the one who came down from heaven to give life to the world.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">The people said, &amp;apos;Sir, give us this bread and don't ever stop!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">Jesus replied:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">I have told you already that you have seen me and still do not have faith in me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">Everything and everyone that the Father has given me will come to me, and I won't turn any of them away.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">I didn't come from heaven to do what I want! I came to do what the Father wants me to do. He sent me,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">and he wants to make certain that none of the ones he has given me will be lost. Instead, he wants me to raise them to life on the last day.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">My Father wants everyone who sees the Son to have faith in him and to have eternal life. Then I will raise them to life on the last day.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">The people started grumbling because Jesus had said he was the bread that had come down from heaven.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">They were asking each other, &amp;apos;Isn't he Jesus, the son of Joseph? Don't we know his father and mother? How can he say that he has come down from heaven?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43">Jesus told them:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44">No one can come to me, unless the Father who sent me makes them want to come. But if they do come, I will raise them to life on the last day.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45">One of the prophets wrote, &amp;apos;God will teach all of them.&amp;apos; And so everyone who listens to the Father and learns from him will come to me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46">The only one who has seen the Father is the one who has come from him. No one else has ever seen the Father.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="47">I tell you for certain that everyone who has faith in me has eternal life.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="48">I am the bread that gives life!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="49">Your ancestors ate manna in the desert, and later they died.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="50">But the bread from heaven has come down, so that no one who eats it will ever die.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="51">I am that bread from heaven! Everyone who eats it will live forever. My flesh is the life-giving bread I give to the people of this world.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="52">They started arguing with each other and asked, &amp;apos;How can he give us his flesh to eat?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="53">Jesus answered:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="54">But if you do eat my flesh and drink my blood, you will have eternal life, and I will raise you to life on the last day.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="55">My flesh is the true food, and my blood is the true drink.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="56">If you eat my flesh and drink my blood, you are one with me, and I am one with you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="57">The living Father sent me, and I have life because of him. Now everyone who eats my flesh will live because of me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="58">The bread that comes down from heaven isn't like what your ancestors ate. They died, but whoever eats this bread will live forever.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="59">Jesus was teaching in a synagogue in Capernaum when he said these things.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="60">Many of Jesus' disciples heard him and said, &amp;apos;This is too hard for anyone to understand.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="61">Jesus knew that his disciples were grumbling. So he asked, &amp;apos;Does this bother you?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="62">What if you should see the Son of Man go up to heaven where he came from?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="63">The Spirit is the one who gives life! Human strength can do nothing. The words that I have spoken to you are from that life-giving Spirit.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="64">But some of you refuse to have faith in me.&amp;apos; Jesus said this, because from the beginning he knew who would have faith in him. He also knew which one would betray him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="65">Then Jesus said, &amp;apos;You cannot come to me, unless the Father makes you want to come. That is why I have told these things to all of you.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="66">Because of what Jesus said, many of his disciples turned their backs on him and stopped following him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="67">Jesus then asked his twelve disciples if they also were going to leave him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="68">Simon Peter answered, &amp;apos;Lord, there is no one else that we can go to! Your words give eternal life.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="69">We have faith in you, and we are sure that you are God's Holy One.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="70">Jesus told his disciples, &amp;apos;I chose all twelve of you, but one of you is a demon!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="71">Jesus was talking about Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot. He would later betray Jesus, even though he was one of the twelve disciples.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="7">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Jesus decided to leave Judea and to start going through Galilee because the leaders of the people wanted to kill him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">It was almost time for the Festival of Shelters,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">and Jesus' brothers said to him, &amp;apos;Why don't you go to Judea? Then your disciples can see what you are doing.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">No one does anything in secret, if they want others to know about them. So let the world know what you are doing!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Even Jesus' own brothers had not yet become his followers. I am not teaching something I thought up. What I teach comes from the one who sent me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Jesus answered, &amp;apos;My time hasn't yet come, but your time is always here.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">The people of this world cannot hate you. They hate me, because I tell them that they do evil things.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Go on to the festival. My time hasn't yet come, and I am not going.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Jesus said this and stayed on in Galilee.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">After Jesus' brothers had gone to the festival, he went secretly, without telling anyone.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">During the festival the leaders of the people looked for Jesus and asked, &amp;apos;Where is he?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">The crowds even got into an argument about him. Some were saying, &amp;apos;Jesus is a good man,&amp;apos; while others were saying, &amp;apos;He is lying to everyone.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">But the people were afraid of their leaders, and none of them talked in public about him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">When the festival was about half over, Jesus went into the temple and started teaching.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">The leaders were surprised and said, &amp;apos;How does this man know so much? He has never been taught!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Jesus replied:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">If you really want to obey God, you will know if what I teach comes from God or from me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">If I wanted to bring honor to myself, I would speak for myself. But I want to honor the one who sent me. This is why I tell the truth and not a lie.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Didn't Moses give you the Law? Yet none of you obey it! So why do you want to kill me?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">The crowd replied, &amp;apos;You're crazy! What makes you think someone wants to kill you?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Jesus answered: I worked one miracle, and it amazed you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Moses commanded you to circumcise your sons. But it wasn't really Moses who gave you this command. It was your ancestors, and even on the Sabbath you circumcise your sons</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">in order to obey the Law of Moses. Why are you angry with me for making someone completely well on the Sabbath?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">Don't judge by appearances. Judge by what is right.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">Some of the people from Jerusalem were saying, &amp;apos;Isn't this the man they want to kill?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">Yet here he is, speaking for everyone to hear. And no one is arguing with him. Do you suppose the authorities know he is the Messiah?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">But how could that be? No one knows where the Messiah will come from, but we know where this man comes from.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">As Jesus was teaching in the temple, he shouted, &amp;apos;Do you really think you know me and where I came from? I didn't come on my own! The one who sent me is truthful, and you don't know him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">But I know the one who sent me, because I came from him.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">Some of the people wanted to arrest Jesus right then. But no one even laid a hand on him, because his time had not yet come.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">A lot of people in the crowd put their faith in him and said, &amp;apos;When the Messiah comes, he surely won't perform more miracles than this man has done!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">When the Pharisees heard the crowd arguing about Jesus, they got together with the chief priests and sent some temple police to arrest him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">But Jesus told them, &amp;apos;I will be with you a little while longer, and then I will return to the one who sent me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">You will look for me, but you won't find me. You cannot go where I am going.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">The people asked each other, &amp;apos;Where can he go to keep us from finding him? Is he going to some foreign country where our people live? Is he going there to teach the Greeks?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">What did he mean by saying that we will look for him, but won't find him? Why can't we go where he is going?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">On the last and most important day of the festival, Jesus stood up and shouted, &amp;apos;If you are thirsty, come to me and drink!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">Have faith in me, and you will have life-giving water flowing from deep inside you, just as the Scriptures say.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">Jesus was talking about the Holy Spirit, who would be given to everyone that had faith in him. The Spirit had not yet been given to anyone, since Jesus had not yet been given his full glory.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">When the crowd heard Jesus say this, some of them said, &amp;apos;He must be the Prophet!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">Others said, &amp;apos;He is the Messiah!&amp;apos; Others even said, &amp;apos;Can the Messiah come from Galilee?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">The Scriptures say that the Messiah will come from the family of King David. Doesn't this mean that he will be born in David's hometown of Bethlehem?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43">The people started taking sides against each other because of Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44">Some of them wanted to arrest him, but no one laid a hand on him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45">When the temple police returned to the chief priests and Pharisees, they were asked, &amp;apos;Why didn't you bring Jesus here?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46">They answered, &amp;apos;No one has ever spoken like this man!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="47">The Pharisees said to them, &amp;apos;Have you also been fooled?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="48">Not one of the chief priests or the Pharisees has faith in him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="49">And these people who don't know the Law are under God's curse anyway.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="50">Nicodemus was there at the time. He was a member of the council, and was the same one who had earlier come to see Jesus. He said,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="51">&amp;apos;Our Law doesn't let us condemn people before we hear what they have to say. We cannot judge them before we know what they have done.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="52">Then they said, &amp;apos;Nicodemus, you must be from Galilee! Read the Scriptures, and you will find that no prophet is to come from Galilee.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="53">Everyone else went home,</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="8">
			<VERS vnumber="1">but Jesus walked out to the Mount of Olives.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Then early the next morning he went to the temple. The people came to him, and he sat down and started teaching them. Even if I do speak for myself, what I say is true! I know where I came from and where I am going. But you don't know where I am from or where I am going. &amp;apos;You don't know me or my Father!&amp;apos; Jesus answered. &amp;apos;If you knew me, you would know my Father.&amp;apos; Jesus answered, &amp;apos;I am exactly who I told you at the beginning. I tell you for certain that anyone who sins is a slave of sin! Jesus replied, &amp;apos;If you were Abraham's children, you would do what Abraham did. &amp;apos;Don't accuse us of having someone else as our father!&amp;apos; they said. &amp;apos;We just have one father, and he is God.&amp;apos; If God were your Father, you would love me, because I came from God and now I am here. He sent me. I did not come on my own.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">The Pharisees and the teachers of the Law of Moses brought in a woman who had been caught in bed with a man who wasn't her husband. They made her stand in the middle of the crowd.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Then they said, &amp;apos;Teacher, this woman was caught sleeping with a man who isn't her husband.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">The Law of Moses teaches that a woman like this should be stoned to death! What do you say?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">They asked Jesus this question, because they wanted to test him and bring some charge against him. But Jesus simply bent over and started writing on the ground with his finger.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">They kept on asking Jesus about the woman. Finally, he stood up and said, &amp;apos;If any of you have never sinned, then go ahead and throw the first stone at her!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Once again he bent over and began writing on the ground.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">The people left one by one, beginning with the oldest. Finally, Jesus and the woman were there alone.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Jesus stood up and asked her, &amp;apos;Where is everyone? Isn't there anyone left to accuse you?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">&amp;apos;No sir,&amp;apos; the woman answered. Then Jesus told her, &amp;apos;I am not going to accuse you either. You may go now, but don't sin anymore.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Once again Jesus spoke to the people. This time he said, &amp;apos;I am the light for the world! Follow me, and you won't be walking in the dark. You will have the light that gives life.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">The Pharisees objected, &amp;apos;You are the only one speaking for yourself, and what you say isn't true!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Jesus replied:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">You judge in the same way that everyone else does, but I don't judge anyone.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">If I did judge, I would judge fairly, because I would not be doing it alone. The Father who sent me is here with me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Your Law requires two witnesses to prove that something is true.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">I am one of my witnesses, and the Father who sent me is the other one.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">&amp;apos;Where is your Father?&amp;apos; they asked.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Jesus said this while he was still teaching in the place where the temple treasures were stored. But no one arrested him, because his time had not yet come.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Jesus also told them, &amp;apos;I am going away, and you will look for me. But you cannot go where I am going, and you will die with your sins unforgiven.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">The people asked, &amp;apos;Does he intend to kill himself? Is that what he means by saying we cannot go where he is going?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">Jesus answered, &amp;apos;You are from below, but I am from above. You belong to this world, but I don't.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">This is why I said you will die with your sins unforgiven. If you don't have faith in me for who I am, you will die, and your sins will not be forgiven.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">&amp;apos;Who are you?&amp;apos; they asked Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">There is a lot more I could say to condemn you. But the one who sent me is truthful, and I tell the people of this world only what I have heard from him.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">No one understood that Jesus was talking to them about the Father.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">Jesus went on to say, &amp;apos;When you have lifted up the Son of Man, you will know who I am. You will also know that I don't do anything on my own. I say only what my Father taught me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">The one who sent me is with me. I always do what pleases him, and he will never leave me.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">After Jesus said this, many of the people put their faith in him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">Jesus told the people who had faith in him, &amp;apos;If you keep on obeying what I have said, you truly are my disciples.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">You will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">They answered, &amp;apos;We are Abraham's children! We have never been anyone's slaves. How can you say we will be set free?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">Jesus replied:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">And slaves don't stay in the family forever, though the Son will always remain in the family.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">If the Son gives you freedom, you are free!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">I know that you are from Abraham's family. Yet you want to kill me, because my message isn't really in your hearts.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">I am telling you what my Father has shown me, just as you are doing what your father has taught you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">The people said to Jesus, &amp;apos;Abraham is our father!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">Instead, you want to kill me for telling you the truth that God gave me. Abraham never did anything like that.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">But you are doing exactly what your father does.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">Jesus answered:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43">Why can't you understand what I am talking about? Can't you stand to hear what I am saying?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44">Your father is the devil, and you do exactly what he wants. He has always been a murderer and a liar. There is nothing truthful about him. He speaks on his own, and everything he says is a lie. Not only is he a liar himself, but he is also the father of all lies.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45">Everything I have told you is true, and you still refuse to have faith in me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46">Can any of you accuse me of sin? If you cannot, why won't you have faith in me? After all, I am telling you the truth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="47">Anyone who belongs to God will listen to his message. But you refuse to listen, because you don't belong to God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="48">The people told Jesus, &amp;apos;We were right to say that you are a Samaritan and that you have a demon in you!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="49">Jesus answered, &amp;apos;I don't have a demon in me. I honor my Father, and you refuse to honor me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="50">I don't want honor for myself. But there is one who wants me to be honored, and he is also the one who judges.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="51">I tell you for certain that if you obey my words, you will never die.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="52">Then the people said, &amp;apos;Now we are sure that you have a demon. Abraham is dead, and so are the prophets. How can you say that no one who obeys your words will ever die?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="53">Are you greater than our father Abraham? He died, and so did the prophets. Who do you think you are?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="54">Jesus replied, &amp;apos;If I honored myself, it would mean nothing. My Father is the one who honors me. You claim that he is your God,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="55">even though you don't really know him. If I said I didn't know him, I would be a liar, just like all of you. But I know him, and I do what he says.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="56">Your father Abraham was really glad to see me.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="57">&amp;apos;You are not even 50 years old!&amp;apos; they said. &amp;apos;How could you have seen Abraham?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="58">Jesus answered, &amp;apos;I tell you for certain that even before Abraham was, I was, and I am.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="59">The people picked up stones to kill Jesus, but he hid and left the temple.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="9">
			<VERS vnumber="1">As Jesus walked along, he saw a man who had been blind since birth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Jesus' disciples asked, &amp;apos;Teacher, why was this man born blind? Was it because he or his parents sinned?&amp;apos; &amp;apos;I don't know,&amp;apos; he answered. Since the Pharisees could not agree among themselves, &amp;apos;He is a prophet!&amp;apos; the man told them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">&amp;apos;No, it wasn't!&amp;apos; Jesus answered. &amp;apos;But because of his blindness, you will see God work a miracle for him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">As long as it is day, we must do what the one who sent me wants me to do. When night comes, no one can work.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">While I am in the world, I am the light for the world.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">After Jesus said this, he spit on the ground. He made some mud and smeared it on the man's eyes.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Then he said, &amp;apos;Go wash off the mud in Siloam Pool.&amp;apos; The man went and washed in Siloam, which means &amp;apos;One Who Is Sent.&amp;apos; When he had washed off the mud, he could see.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">The man's neighbors and the people who had seen him begging wondered if he really could be the same man.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Some of them said he was the same beggar, while others said he only looked like him. But he told them, &amp;apos;I am that man.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">&amp;apos;Then how can you see?&amp;apos; they asked.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">He answered, &amp;apos;Someone named Jesus made some mud and smeared it on my eyes. He told me to go and wash it off in Siloam Pool. When I did, I could see.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">&amp;apos;Where is he now?&amp;apos; they asked.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">They asked him how he was able to see, and he answered, &amp;apos;Jesus made some mud and smeared it on my eyes. Then after I washed it off, I could see.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Some of the Pharisees said, &amp;apos;This man Jesus doesn't come from God. If he did, he would not break the law of the Sabbath.&amp;apos; Others asked, &amp;apos;How could someone who is a sinner work such a miracle?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">they asked the man, &amp;apos;What do you say about this one who healed your eyes?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">But the Jewish leaders would not believe that the man had once been blind. They sent for his parents</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">and asked them, &amp;apos;Is this the son that you said was born blind? How can he now see?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">The man's parents answered, &amp;apos;We are certain that he is our son, and we know that he was born blind.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">But we don't know how he got his sight or who gave it to him. Ask him! He is old enough to speak for himself.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">The leaders called the man back and said, &amp;apos;Swear by God to tell the truth! We know that Jesus is a sinner.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">The man replied, &amp;apos;I don't know if he is a sinner or not. All I know is that I used to be blind, but now I can see!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">&amp;apos;What did he do to you?&amp;apos; they asked. &amp;apos;How did he heal your eyes?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">The man answered, &amp;apos;I have already told you once, and you refused to listen. Why do you want me to tell you again? Do you also want to become his disciples?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">The leaders insulted the man and said, &amp;apos;You are his follower! We are followers of Moses.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">We are sure God spoke to Moses, but we don't even know where Jesus comes from.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">&amp;apos;How strange!&amp;apos; the man replied. &amp;apos;He healed my eyes, and yet you don't know where he comes from.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">We know that God listens only to people who love and obey him. God doesn't listen to sinners.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">And this is the first time in history anyone has ever given sight to someone born blind.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">Jesus could not do anything unless he came from God.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">The leaders told the man, &amp;apos;You have been a sinner since the day you were born! Do you think you can teach us anything?&amp;apos; Then they said, &amp;apos;You can never come back into any of our synagogues!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">When Jesus heard what had happened, he went and found the man. Then Jesus asked, &amp;apos;Do you have faith in the Son of Man?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">He replied, &amp;apos;Sir, if you will tell me who he is, I will put my faith in him.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">&amp;apos;You have already seen him,&amp;apos; Jesus answered, &amp;apos;and right now he is talking with you.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">The man said, &amp;apos;Lord, I put my faith in you!&amp;apos; Then he worshiped Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">Jesus told him, &amp;apos;I came to judge the people of this world. I am here to give sight to the blind and to make blind everyone who can see.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">When the Pharisees heard Jesus say this, they asked, &amp;apos;Are we blind?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">Jesus answered, &amp;apos;If you were blind, you would not be guilty. But now that you claim to see, you will keep on being guilty.&amp;apos;</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="10">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Jesus said: I tell you for certain only thieves and robbers climb over the fence instead of going in through the gate to the sheep pen. I tell you for certain that I am the gate for the sheep. I have told you, and you refused to believe me. The things I do by my Father's authority show who I am. In your Scriptures doesn't God say, &amp;apos;You are gods&amp;apos;?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">When he has led out all of his sheep, he walks in front of them, and they follow, because they know his voice.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">The sheep will not follow strangers. They don't recognize a stranger's voice, and they run away.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Jesus told the people this story. But they did not understand what he was talking about.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Jesus said:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Everyone who came before me was a thief or a robber, and the sheep did not listen to any of them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">I am the gate. All who come in through me will be saved. Through me they will come and go and find pasture.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">A thief comes only to rob, kill, and destroy. I came so everyone would have life, and have it fully.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">I am the good shepherd, and the good shepherd gives up his life for his sheep.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Hired workers are not like the shepherd. They don't own the sheep, and when they see a wolf coming, they run off and leave the sheep. Then the wolf attacks and scatters the flock.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Hired workers run away because they don't care about the sheep.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">I am the good shepherd. I know my sheep, and they know me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Just as the Father knows me, I know the Father, and I give up my life for my sheep.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">I have other sheep that are not in this sheep pen. I must also bring them together, when they hear my voice. Then there will be one flock of sheep and one shepherd.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">The Father loves me, because I give up my life, so I may receive it back again.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">No one takes my life from me. I give it up willingly! I have the power to give it up and the power to receive it back again, just as my Father commanded me to do.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">The people took sides because of what Jesus had told them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Many of them said, &amp;apos;He has a demon in him! He is crazy! Why listen to him?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">But others said, &amp;apos;How could anyone with a demon in him say these things? No one like this could give sight to a blind person!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">That winter, Jesus was in Jerusalem for the Temple Festival.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">One day he was walking in the part of the temple known as Solomon's Porch,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">and the people gathered all around him. They said, &amp;apos;How long are you going to keep us guessing? If you are the Messiah, tell us plainly!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">Jesus answered:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">But since you are not my sheep, you don't believe me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">My sheep know my voice, and I know them. They follow me,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">and I give them eternal life, so that they will never be lost. No one can snatch them out of my hand.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">My Father gave them to me, and he is greater than all others. No one can snatch them from his hands,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">and I am one with the Father.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">Once again the people picked up stones in order to kill Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">But he said, &amp;apos;I have shown you many good things my Father sent me to do. Which one are you going to stone me for?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">They answered, &amp;apos;We are not stoning you because of any good thing you did. We are stoning you because you did a terrible thing. You are just a man, and here you are claiming to be God!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">Jesus replied:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">You can't argue with the Scriptures, and God spoke to those people and called them gods.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">So why do you accuse me of a terrible sin for saying that I am the Son of God? After all, it is the Father who prepared me for this work. He is also the one who sent me into the world.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">If I don't do as my Father does, you should not believe me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">But if I do what my Father does, you should believe because of that, even if you don't have faith in me. Then you will know for certain that the Father is one with me, and I am one with the Father.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">Again they wanted to arrest Jesus. But he escaped</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">and crossed the Jordan to the place where John had earlier been baptizing. While Jesus was there,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">many people came to him. They were saying, &amp;apos;John didn't work any miracles, but everything he said about Jesus is true.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">A lot of those people also put their faith in Jesus.</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="11">
			<VERS vnumber="3">The sisters sent a message to the Lord and told him that his good friend Lazarus was sick. They replied, &amp;apos;Lord, come and you will see.&amp;apos; Jesus then told the people, &amp;apos;Untie him and let him go.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">When Jesus heard this, he said, &amp;apos;His sickness won't end in death. It will bring glory to God and his Son.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Jesus loved Martha and her sister and brother.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">But he stayed where he was for two more days.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Then he said to his disciples, &amp;apos;Now we will go back to Judea.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">&amp;apos;Teacher,&amp;apos; they said, &amp;apos;the people there want to stone you to death! Why do you want to go back?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Jesus answered, &amp;apos;Aren't there twelve hours in each day? If you walk during the day, you will have light from the sun, and you won't stumble.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">But if you walk during the night, you will stumble, because you don't have any light.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Then he told them, &amp;apos;Our friend Lazarus is asleep, and I am going there to wake him up.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">They replied, &amp;apos;Lord, if he is asleep, he will get better.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Jesus really meant that Lazarus was dead, but they thought he was talking only about sleep.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Then Jesus told them plainly, &amp;apos;Lazarus is dead!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">I am glad I wasn't there, because now you will have a chance to put your faith in me. Let's go to him.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Thomas, whose nickname was &amp;apos;Twin,&amp;apos; said to the other disciples, &amp;apos;Come on. Let's go, so we can die with him.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">When Jesus got to Bethany, he found that Lazarus had already been in the tomb four days.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Bethany was less than three kilometers from Jerusalem,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">and many people had come from the city to comfort Martha and Mary because their brother had died.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">When Martha heard that Jesus had arrived, she went out to meet him, but Mary stayed in the house.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Martha said to Jesus, &amp;apos;Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Yet even now I know that God will do anything you ask.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">Jesus told her, &amp;apos;Your brother will live again!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">Martha answered, &amp;apos;I know he will be raised to life on the last day, when all the dead are raised.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">Jesus then said, &amp;apos;I am the one who raises the dead to life! Everyone who has faith in me will live, even if they die.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">And everyone who lives because of faith in me will never really die. Do you believe this?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">&amp;apos;Yes, Lord!&amp;apos; she replied. &amp;apos;I believe you are the Christ, the Son of God. You are the one we hoped would come into the world.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">After Martha said this, she went and privately said to her sister Mary, &amp;apos;The Teacher is here, and he wants to see you.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">As soon as Mary heard this, she got up and went out to Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">He was still outside the village where Martha had gone to meet him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">Many people had come to comfort Mary, and when they saw her quickly leave the house, they thought she was going out to the tomb to cry. So they followed her.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">Mary went to where Jesus was. Then as soon as she saw him, she knelt at his feet and said, &amp;apos;Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">When Jesus saw that Mary and the people with her were crying, he was terribly upset</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">and asked, &amp;apos;Where have you put his body?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">Jesus started crying,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">and the people said, &amp;apos;See how much he loved Lazarus.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">Some of them said, &amp;apos;He gives sight to the blind. Why couldn't he have kept Lazarus from dying?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">Jesus was still terribly upset. So he went to the tomb, which was a cave with a stone rolled against the entrance.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">Then he told the people to roll the stone away. But Martha said, &amp;apos;Lord, you know that Lazarus has been dead four days, and there will be a bad smell.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">Jesus replied, &amp;apos;Didn't I tell you that if you had faith, you would see the glory of God?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">After the stone had been rolled aside, Jesus looked up toward heaven and prayed, &amp;apos;Father, I thank you for answering my prayer.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">I know that you always answer my prayers. But I said this, so the people here would believe you sent me.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43">When Jesus had finished praying, he shouted, &amp;apos;Lazarus, come out!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44">The man who had been dead came out. His hands and feet were wrapped with strips of burial cloth, and a cloth covered his face.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45">Many of the people who had come to visit Mary saw the things Jesus did, and they put their faith in him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46">Others went to the Pharisees and told what Jesus had done.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="47">Then the chief priests and the Pharisees called the council together and said, &amp;apos;What should we do? This man is working a lot of miracles.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="48">If we don't stop him now, everyone will put their faith in him. Then the Romans will come and destroy our temple and our nation.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="49">One of the council members was Caiaphas, who was also high priest that year. He spoke up and said, &amp;apos;You people don't have any sense at all!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="50">Don't you know it is better for one person to die for the people than for the whole nation to be destroyed?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="51">Caiaphas did not say this on his own. As high priest that year, he was prophesying that Jesus would die for the nation.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="52">Yet Jesus would not die just for the Jewish nation. He would die to bring together all of God's scattered people.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="53">From that day on, the council started making plans to put Jesus to death.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="54">Because of this plot against him, Jesus stopped going around in public. He went to the town of Ephraim, which was near the desert, and he stayed there with his disciples.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="55">It was almost time for Passover. Many of the Jewish people who lived out in the country had come to Jerusalem to get themselves ready for the festival.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="56">They looked around for Jesus. Then when they were in the temple, they asked each other, &amp;apos;You don't think he will come here for Passover, do you?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="57">The chief priests and the Pharisees told the people to let them know if any of them saw Jesus. This is how they hoped to arrest him.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="12">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Six days before Passover Jesus went back to Bethany, where he had raised Lazarus from death.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">A meal had been prepared for Jesus. Martha was doing the serving, and Lazarus himself was there. God bless the one who comes in the name of the Lord! God bless the King of Israel!&amp;apos; don't be afraid! Your King is now coming, and he is riding on a donkey.&amp;apos; A voice from heaven then said, &amp;apos;I have already brought glory to myself, and I will do it again!&amp;apos; After Jesus had said these things, he left and went into hiding. &amp;apos;Lord, who has believed our message? And who has seen your mighty strength?&amp;apos; the eyes of the people, and he has made the people stubborn. He did this so that they could not see or understand, and so that they would not turn to the Lord and be healed.&amp;apos; Everyone who has faith in me also has faith in the one who sent me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Mary took a very expensive bottle of perfume and poured it on Jesus' feet. She wiped them with her hair, and the sweet smell of the perfume filled the house.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">A disciple named Judas Iscariot was there. He was the one who was going to betray Jesus, and he asked,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">&amp;apos;Why wasn't this perfume sold for 300 silver coins and the money given to the poor?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Judas did not really care about the poor. He asked this because he carried the moneybag and sometimes would steal from it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Jesus replied, &amp;apos;Leave her alone! She has kept this perfume for the day of my burial.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">You will always have the poor with you, but you won't always have me.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">A lot of people came when they heard that Jesus was there. They also wanted to see Lazarus, because Jesus had raised him from death.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">So the chief priests made plans to kill Lazarus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">He was the reason that many of the people were turning from them and putting their faith in Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">The next day a large crowd was in Jerusalem for Passover. When they heard that Jesus was coming for the festival,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">they took palm branches and went out to greet him. They shouted, &amp;apos;Hooray! The time has come for the Son of Man to be given his glory.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Jesus found a donkey and rode on it, just as the Scriptures say,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">&amp;apos;People of Jerusalem,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">At first, Jesus' disciples did not understand. But after he had been given his glory, they remembered all this. Everything had happened exactly as the Scriptures said it would.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">But the Pharisees said to each other, &amp;apos;There is nothing we can do! Everyone in the world is following Jesus.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Some Greeks had gone to Jerusalem to worship during Passover.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Philip from Bethsaida in Galilee was there too. So they went to him and said, &amp;apos;Sir, we would like to meet Jesus.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Philip told Andrew. Then the two of them went to Jesus and told him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">Jesus said:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">I tell you for certain that a grain of wheat that falls on the ground will never be more than one grain unless it dies. But if it dies, it will produce lots of wheat.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">If you love your life, you will lose it. If you give it up in this world, you will be given eternal life.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">If you serve me, you must go with me. My servants will be with me wherever I am. If you serve me, my Father will honor you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">Now I am deeply troubled, and I don't know what to say. But I must not ask my Father to keep me from this time of suffering. In fact, I came into the world to suffer.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">So Father, bring glory to yourself.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">When the crowd heard the voice, some of them thought it was thunder. Others thought an angel had spoken to Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">Then Jesus told the crowd, &amp;apos;That voice spoke to help you, not me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">This world's people are now being judged, and the ruler of this world is already being thrown out!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">If I am lifted up above the earth, I will make everyone want to come to me.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">Jesus was talking about the way he would be put to death.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">The crowd said to Jesus, &amp;apos;The Scriptures teach that the Messiah will live forever. How can you say that the Son of Man must be lifted up? Who is this Son of Man?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">Jesus answered, &amp;apos;The light will be with you for only a little longer. Walk in the light while you can. Then you won't be caught walking blindly in the dark.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">Have faith in the light while it is with you, and you will be children of the light.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">He had worked a lot of miracles among the people, but they were still not willing to have faith in him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">This happened so that what the prophet Isaiah had said would come true,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">The people could not have faith in Jesus, because Isaiah had also said,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">&amp;apos;The Lord has blinded</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">Isaiah said this, because he saw the glory of Jesus and spoke about him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">Even then, many of the leaders put their faith in Jesus, but they did not tell anyone about it. The Pharisees had already given orders for the people not to have anything to do with anyone who had faith in Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43">And besides, the leaders liked praise from others more than they liked praise from God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44">In a loud voice Jesus said:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45">And everyone who has seen me has seen the one who sent me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46">I am the light that has come into the world. No one who has faith in me will stay in the dark.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="47">I am not the one who will judge those who refuse to obey my teachings. I came to save the people of this world, not to be their judge.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="48">But everyone who rejects me and my teachings will be judged on the last day by what I have said.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="49">I don't speak on my own. I say only what the Father who sent me has told me to say.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="50">I know that his commands will bring eternal life. This is why I tell you exactly what the Father has told me.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="13">
			<VERS vnumber="1">It was before Passover, and Jesus knew that the time had come for him to leave this world and to return to the Father. He had always loved his followers in this world, and he loved them to the very end. &amp;apos;If I don't wash you,&amp;apos; Jesus told him, &amp;apos;you don't really belong to me.&amp;apos; Do you understand what I have done? Jesus said, &amp;apos;Judas, go quickly and do what you have to do.&amp;apos; It was already night. Now the Son of Man will be given glory, and he will bring glory to God. Jesus answered, &amp;apos;You can't go with me now, but later on you will.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Even before the evening meal started, the devil had made Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot, decide to betray Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Jesus knew he had come from God and would go back to God. He also knew that the Father had given him complete power.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">So during the meal Jesus got up, removed his outer garment, and wrapped a towel around his waist.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">He put some water into a large bowl. Then he began washing his disciples' feet and drying them with the towel he was wearing.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">But when he came to Simon Peter, this disciple asked, &amp;apos;Lord, are you going to wash my feet?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Jesus answered, &amp;apos;You don't really know what I am doing, but later you will understand.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">&amp;apos;You will never wash my feet!&amp;apos; Peter replied.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Peter said, &amp;apos;Lord, don't wash just my feet. Wash my hands and my head.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Jesus answered, &amp;apos;People who have bathed and are clean all over need to wash just their feet. And you, my disciples, are clean, except for one of you.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Jesus knew who would betray him. That is why he said, &amp;apos;except for one of you.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">After Jesus had washed his disciples' feet and had put his outer garment back on, he sat down again. Then he said:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">You call me your teacher and Lord, and you should, because that is who I am.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">And if your Lord and teacher has washed your feet, you should do the same for each other.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">I have set the example, and you should do for each other exactly what I have done for you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">I tell you for certain that servants are not greater than their master, and messengers are not greater than the one who sent them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">You know these things, and God will bless you, if you do them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">I am not talking about all of you. I know the ones I have chosen. But what the Scriptures say must come true. And they say, &amp;apos;The man who ate with me has turned against me!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">I am telling you this before it all happens. Then when it does happen, you will believe who I am.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">I tell you for certain that anyone who welcomes my messengers also welcomes me, and anyone who welcomes me welcomes the one who sent me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">After Jesus had said these things, he was deeply troubled and told his disciples, &amp;apos;I tell you for certain that one of you will betray me.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">They were confused about what he meant. And they just stared at each other.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">Jesus' favorite disciple was sitting next to him at the meal,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">and Simon motioned for this disciple to find out which one Jesus meant.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">So the disciple leaned toward Jesus and asked, &amp;apos;Lord, which one of us are you talking about?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">Jesus answered, &amp;apos;I will dip this piece of bread in the sauce and give it to the one I was talking about.&amp;apos; Then Jesus dipped the bread and gave it to Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">Right then Satan took control of Judas.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">No one at the meal understood what Jesus meant.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">But because Judas was in charge of the money, some of them thought that Jesus had told him to buy something they needed for the festival. Others thought that Jesus had told him to give some money to the poor.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">Judas took the piece of bread and went out.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">After Judas had gone, Jesus said:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">Then, after God is given glory because of him, God will bring glory to him, and God will do it very soon.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">My children, I will be with you for only a little while longer. Then you will look for me, but you won't find me. I tell you just as I told the people, &amp;apos;You cannot go where I am going.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">But I am giving you a new command. You must love each other, just as I have loved you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">If you love each other, everyone will know that you are my disciples.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">Simon Peter asked, &amp;apos;Lord, where are you going?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">Peter asked, &amp;apos;Lord, why can't I go with you now? I would die for you!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">&amp;apos;Would you really die for me?&amp;apos; Jesus asked. &amp;apos;I tell you for certain before a rooster crows, you will say three times that you don't even know me.&amp;apos;</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="14">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Jesus said to his disciples, &amp;apos;Don't be worried! Have faith in God and have faith in me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">There are many rooms in my Father's house. I wouldn't tell you this, unless it was true. I am going there to prepare a place for each of you.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="6">&amp;apos;I am the way, the truth, and the life!&amp;apos; Jesus answered. &amp;apos;Without me, no one can go to the Father.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">If you had really known me, you would have known the Father. But from now on, you do know him, and you have seen him.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Philip said, &amp;apos;Lord, show us the Father. That is all we need.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Jesus replied:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Don't you believe that I am one with the Father and that the Father is one with me? What I say isn't said on my own. The Father who lives in me does these things.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Have faith in me when I say that the Father is one with me and that I am one with the Father. Or else have faith in me simply because of the things I do.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">I tell you for certain that if you have faith in me, you will do the same things I am doing. You will do even greater things, now that I am going back to the Father.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Ask me, and I will do whatever you ask. This way the Son will bring honor to the Father.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">I will do whatever you ask me to do.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Jesus said to his disciples:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Then I will ask the Father to send you the Holy Spirit who will help you and always be with you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">The Spirit will show you what is true. The people of this world cannot accept the Spirit, because they don't see or know him. But you know the Spirit, who is with you and will keep on living in you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">I won't leave you like orphans. I will come back to you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">In a little while the people of this world won't be able to see me, but you will see me. And because I live, you will live.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Then you will know I am one with the Father. You will know you are one with me, and I am one with you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">If you love me, you will do what I have said, and my Father will love you. I will also love you and show you what I am like.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">The other Judas, not Judas Iscariot, then spoke up and asked, &amp;apos;Lord, what do you mean by saying that you will show us what you are like, but you will not show the people of this world?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">Jesus replied:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">But anyone who doesn't love me, won't obey me. What they have heard me say doesn't really come from me, but from the Father who sent me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">I have told you these things while I am still with you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">But the Holy Spirit will come and help you, because the Father will send the Spirit to take my place. The Spirit will teach you everything and will remind you of what I said while I was with you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">I give you peace, the kind of peace only I can give. It isn't like the peace this world can give. So don't be worried or afraid.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">You have already heard me say I am going and I will also come back to you. If you really love me, you should be glad I am going back to the Father, because he is greater than I am.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">I am telling you this before I leave, so when it does happen, you will have faith in me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">I cannot speak with you much longer, because the ruler of this world is coming. But he has no power over me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">I obey my Father, so everyone in the world might know that I love him.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1">Jesus said to his disciples: I am the true vine, and my Father is the gardener.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">He cuts away every branch of mine that doesn't produce fruit. But he trims clean every branch that does produce fruit, so that it will produce even more fruit.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">You are already clean because of what I have said to you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Stay joined to me, and I will stay joined to you. Just as a branch cannot produce fruit unless it stays joined to the vine, you cannot produce fruit unless you stay joined to me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">I am the vine, and you are the branches. If you stay joined to me, and I stay joined to you, then you will produce lots of fruit. But you cannot do anything without me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">If you don't stay joined to me, you will be thrown away. You will be like dry branches that are gathered up and burned in a fire.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Stay joined to me and let my teachings become part of you. Then you can pray for whatever you want, and your prayer will be answered.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">When you become fruitful disciples of mine, my Father will be honored.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">I have loved you, just as my Father has loved me. So remain faithful to my love for you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">If you obey me, I will keep loving you, just as my Father keeps loving me, because I have obeyed him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">I have told you this to make you as completely happy as I am.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Now I tell you to love each other, as I have loved you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">The greatest way to show love for friends is to die for them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">And you are my friends, if you obey me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Servants don't know what their master is doing, and so I don't speak to you as my servants. I speak to you as my friends, and I have told you everything my Father has told me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">You did not choose me. I chose you and sent you out to produce fruit, the kind of fruit that will last. Then my Father will give you whatever you ask for in my name.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">So I command you to love each other.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">If the people of this world hate you, just remember that they hated me first.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">If you belonged to the world, its people would love you. But you don't belong to the world. I have chosen you to leave the world behind, and this is why its people hate you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Remember how I told you that servants are not greater than their master. So if people mistreat me, they will mistreat you. If they do what I say, they will do what you say.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">People will do to you exactly what they did to me. They will do it because you belong to me, and they don't know the one who sent me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">If I had not come and spoken to them, they would not be guilty of sin. But now they have no excuse for their sin.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">Everyone who hates me also hates my Father.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">I have done things no one else has ever done. If they had not seen me do these things, they would not be guilty. But they did see me do these things, and they still hate me and my Father too.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">This is why the Scriptures are true when they say, &amp;apos;People hated me for no reason.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">I will send you the Spirit who comes from the Father and shows what is true. The Spirit will help you and will tell you about me.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1">I am telling you these things, so that you will not turn away.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">You will be chased out of the synagogues. And the time will come when people will kill you and think they are doing God a favor.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">They will do these things because they don't know either the Father or me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">I am saying this to you now, so that when the time comes, you will remember what I have said. I was with you at the first, and so I didn't tell you these things. You are wondering what I meant when I said that for a little while you won't see me, but after a while you will see me. Do you really believe me?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">But now I am going back to the Father who sent me, and none of you asks me where I am going.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">You are very sad from hearing all of this.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">But I tell you I am going to do what is best for you. This is why I am going away. The Holy Spirit cannot come to help you until I leave. But after I am gone, I will send the Spirit to you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">The Spirit will come and show the people of this world the truth about sin and God's justice and the judgment.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">The Spirit will show them that they are wrong about sin, because they didn't have faith in me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">They are wrong about God's justice, because I am going to the Father, and you won't see me again.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">And they are wrong about the judgment, because God has already judged the ruler of this world.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">I have much more to say to you, but right now it would be more than you could understand.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">The Spirit shows what is true and will come and guide you into the full truth. The Spirit doesn't speak on his own. He will tell you only what he has heard from me, and he will let you know what is going to happen.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">The Spirit will bring glory to me by taking my message and telling it to you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Everything the Father has is mine. This is why I have said that the Spirit takes my message and tells it to you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Jesus told his disciples, &amp;apos;For a little while you won't see me, but after a while you will see me.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">They said to each other, &amp;apos;What does Jesus mean by saying that for a little while we won't see him, but after a while we will see him? What does he mean by saying he is going to the Father?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">What is this &amp;quot;little while&amp;quot; that he is talking about? We don't know what he means.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Jesus knew they had some questions, so he said:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">I tell you for certain that you will cry and be sad, but the world will be happy. You will be sad, but later you will be happy.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">When a woman is about to give birth, she is in great pain. But after it is all over, she forgets the pain and is happy, because she has brought a child into the world.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">You are now very sad. But later I will see you, and you will be so happy that no one will be able to change the way you feel.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">When that time comes, you won't have to ask me about anything. I tell you for certain the Father will give you whatever you ask for in my name.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">You have not asked for anything in this way before, but now you must ask in my name. Then it will be given to you, so you will be completely happy.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">I have used examples to explain to you what I have been talking about. But the time will come when I will speak to you plainly about the Father and will no longer use examples like these.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">You will ask the Father in my name, and I won't have to ask him for you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">God the Father loves you because you love me, and you believe I have come from him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">I came from the Father into the world, but I am leaving the world and returning to the Father.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">The disciples said, &amp;apos;Now you are speaking plainly to us! You are not using examples.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">At last we know that you understand everything, and we don't have any more questions. Now we believe you truly have come from God.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">Jesus replied:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">The time will come and is already here when all of you will be scattered. Each of you will go back home and leave me by myself. But the Father will be with me, and I won't be alone.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">I have told you this, so that you might have peace in your hearts because of me. While you are in the world, you will have to suffer. But cheer up! I have defeated the world.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1">After Jesus had finished speaking to his disciples, he looked up toward heaven and prayed: Father, the time has come for you to bring glory to your Son, in order that he may bring glory to you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">And you gave him power over all people, so he would give eternal life to everyone you give him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Eternal life is to know you, the only true God, and to know Jesus Christ, the one you sent.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">I have brought glory to you here on earth by doing everything you gave me to do.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Now, Father, give me back the glory I had with you before the world was created.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">You have given me some followers from this world, and I have shown them what you are like. They were yours, but you gave them to me, and they have obeyed you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">They know that you gave me everything I have.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">I told my followers what you told me, and they accepted it. They know I came from you, and they believe you are the one who sent me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">I am praying for them, but not for those who belong to this world. My followers belong to you, and I am praying for them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">All I have is yours, and all you have is mine, and they will bring glory to me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Holy Father, I am no longer in the world. I am coming to you, but my followers are still in the world. So keep them safe by the power of the name you have given me. Then they will be one with each other, just as you and I are one.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">While I was with them, I kept them safe by the power you have given me. I guarded them, and not one of them was lost, except the one who had to be lost. This happened so that what the Scriptures say would come true.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">I am on my way to you. But I say these things while I am still in the world, so my followers will have the same complete joy that I do.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">I have told them your message. But the people of this world hate them, because they don't belong to this world, just as I don't.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Father, I don't ask you to take my followers out of the world, but keep them safe from the evil one.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">They don't belong to this world, and neither do I.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Your word is the truth. So let this truth make them completely yours.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">I am sending them into the world, just as you sent me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">I have given myself completely for their sake, so they may belong completely to the truth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">I am not praying just for these followers. I am also praying for everyone else who will have faith because of what my followers will say about me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">I want all of them to be one with each other, just as I am one with you and you are one with me. I also want them to be one with us. Then the people of this world will believe that you sent me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">I have honored my followers in the same way you honored me, in order that they may be one with each other, just as we are one.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">I am one with them, and you are one with me, so they may become completely one. Then this world's people will know that you sent me. They will know that you love my followers as much as you love me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">Father, I want everyone you have given me to be with me, wherever I am. Then they will see the glory you have given me, because you loved me before the world was created.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">Good Father, the people of this world don't know you. But I know you, and my followers know that you sent me.</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="18">
			<VERS vnumber="1">When Jesus had finished praying, he and his disciples crossed the Kidron Valley and went into a garden.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Jesus had often met there with his disciples, and Judas knew where the place was. They answered, &amp;apos;We are looking for Jesus from Nazareth!&amp;apos; &amp;apos;We are looking for Jesus from Nazareth,&amp;apos; they answered. &amp;apos;No, I am not!&amp;apos; Peter answered. Again Peter denied it and said, &amp;apos;No, I am not!&amp;apos; The crowd replied, &amp;apos;We are not allowed to put anyone to death.&amp;apos; &amp;apos;You are saying that I am a king,&amp;apos; Jesus told him. &amp;apos;I was born into this world to tell about the truth. And everyone who belongs to the truth knows my voice.&amp;apos; Pilate went back out and said, &amp;apos;I don't find this man guilty of anything!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">At once they all backed away and fell to the ground.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Jesus again asked, &amp;apos;Who are you looking for?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">This time Jesus replied, &amp;apos;I have already told you that I am Jesus. If I am the one you are looking for, let these others go.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Then everything will happen, just as I said, &amp;quot;I did not lose anyone you gave me.&amp;quot; &amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Simon Peter had brought along a sword. He pulled it out and struck at Malchus, the servant of the high priest, cutting off his right ear.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Jesus told Peter, &amp;apos;Put your sword away. I must drink from the cup that the Father has given me.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">The Roman officer and his men, together with the temple police, arrested Jesus and tied him up.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">They took him first to Annas, who was the father-in-law of Caiaphas, the high priest that year.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">This was the same Caiaphas who had told the Jewish leaders, &amp;apos;It is better if one person dies for the people.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Simon Peter and another disciple followed Jesus. That disciple knew the high priest, and he followed Jesus into the courtyard of the high priest's house.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Peter stayed outside near the gate. But the other disciple came back out and spoke to the girl at the gate. She let Peter go in,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">but asked him, &amp;apos;Aren't you one of that man's followers?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">It was cold, and the servants and temple police had made a charcoal fire. They were warming themselves around it, when Peter went over and stood near the fire to warm himself.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">The high priest questioned Jesus about his followers and his teaching.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">But Jesus told him, &amp;apos;I have spoken freely in front of everyone. And I have always taught in our synagogues and in the temple, where all of our people come together. I have not said anything in secret.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Why are you questioning me? Why don't you ask the people who heard me? They know what I have said.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">As soon as Jesus said this, one of the temple police hit him and said, &amp;apos;That's no way to talk to the high priest!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">Jesus answered, &amp;apos;If I have done something wrong, say so. But if not, why did you hit me?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">Jesus was still tied up, and Annas sent him to Caiaphas the high priest.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">While Simon Peter was standing there warming himself, someone asked him, &amp;apos;Aren't you one of Jesus' followers?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">One of the high priest's servants was there. He was a relative of the servant whose ear Peter had cut off, and he asked, &amp;apos;Didn't I see you in the garden with that man?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">Once more Peter denied it, and right then a rooster crowed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">It was early in the morning when Jesus was taken from Caiaphas to the building where the Roman governor stayed. But the crowd waited outside. Any of them who had gone inside would have become unclean and would not be allowed to eat the Passover meal.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">Pilate came out and asked, &amp;apos;What charges are you bringing against this man?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">They answered, &amp;apos;He is a criminal! That's why we brought him to you.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">Pilate told them, &amp;apos;Take him and judge him by your own laws.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">And so what Jesus said about his death would soon come true.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">Pilate then went back inside. He called Jesus over and asked, &amp;apos;Are you the king of the Jews?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">Jesus answered, &amp;apos;Are you asking this on your own or did someone tell you about me?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">&amp;apos;You know I'm not a Jew!&amp;apos; Pilate said. &amp;apos;Your own people and the chief priests brought you to me. What have you done?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">Jesus answered, &amp;apos;My kingdom doesn't belong to this world. If it did, my followers would have fought to keep me from being handed over to our leaders. No, my kingdom doesn't belong to this world.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">&amp;apos;So you are a king,&amp;apos; Pilate replied.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">Pilate asked Jesus, &amp;apos;What is truth?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">And since I usually set a prisoner free for you at Passover, would you like for me to set free the king of the Jews?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">They shouted, &amp;apos;No, not him! We want Barabbas.&amp;apos; Now Barabbas was a terrorist.</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="19">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Pilate gave orders for Jesus to be beaten with a whip.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">The soldiers made a crown out of thorn branches and put it on Jesus. Then they put a purple robe on him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">They came up to him and said, &amp;apos;Hey, you king of the Jews!&amp;apos; They also hit him with their fists. Pilate told them, &amp;apos;You take him and nail him to a cross! I don't find him guilty of anything.&amp;apos; &amp;apos;So you want me to nail your king to a cross?&amp;apos; Pilate asked. The chief priests replied, &amp;apos;The Emperor is our king!&amp;apos; Jesus was taken away, The place where Jesus was taken wasn't far from the city, and many of the people read the charge against him. &amp;apos;They divided up my clothes and gambled for my garments.&amp;apos; The soldiers then did what they had decided.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Once again Pilate went out. This time he said, &amp;apos;I will have Jesus brought out to you again. Then you can see for yourselves that I have not found him guilty.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Jesus came out, wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe. Pilate said, &amp;apos;Here is the man!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">When the chief priests and the temple police saw him, they yelled, &amp;apos;Nail him to a cross! Nail him to a cross!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">The crowd replied, &amp;apos;He claimed to be the Son of God! Our law says that he must be put to death.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">When Pilate heard this, he was terrified.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">He went back inside and asked Jesus, &amp;apos;Where are you from?&amp;apos; But Jesus did not answer.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">&amp;apos;Why won't you answer my question?&amp;apos; Pilate asked. &amp;apos;Don't you know I have the power to let you go free or to nail you to a cross?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Jesus replied, &amp;apos;If God had not given you the power, you couldn't do anything at all to me. But the one who handed me over to you did something even worse.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Then Pilate wanted to set Jesus free. But the crowd again yelled, &amp;apos;If you set this man free, you are no friend of the Emperor! Anyone who claims to be a king is an enemy of the Emperor.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">When Pilate heard this, he brought Jesus out. Then he sat down on the judge's bench at the place known as &amp;apos;The Stone Pavement.&amp;apos; In Aramaic this pavement is called &amp;apos;Gabbatha.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">It was about noon on the day before Passover, and Pilate said to the crowd, &amp;apos;Look at your king!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">&amp;apos;Kill him! Kill him!&amp;apos; they yelled. &amp;apos;Nail him to a cross!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Then Pilate handed Jesus over to be nailed to a cross.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">and he carried his cross to a place known as &amp;apos;The Skull.&amp;apos; In Aramaic this place is called &amp;apos;Golgotha.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">There Jesus was nailed to the cross, and on each side of him a man was also nailed to a cross.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Pilate ordered the charge against Jesus to be written on a board and put above the cross. It read, &amp;apos;Jesus of Nazareth, King of the Jews.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">The words were written in Hebrew, Latin, and Greek.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">So the chief priests went to Pilate and said, &amp;apos;Why did you write that he is King of the Jews? You should have written, &amp;quot;He claimed to be King of the Jews.&amp;quot; &amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">But Pilate told them, &amp;apos;What is written will not be changed!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">After the soldiers had nailed Jesus to the cross, they divided up his clothes into four parts, one for each of them. But his outer garment was made from a single piece of cloth, and it did not have any seams.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">The soldiers said to each other, &amp;apos;Let's not rip it apart. We will gamble to see who gets it.&amp;apos; This happened so the Scriptures would come true, which say,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">Jesus' mother stood beside his cross with her sister and Mary the wife of Clopas. Mary Magdalene was standing there too.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">When Jesus saw his mother and his favorite disciple with her, he said to his mother, &amp;apos;This man is now your son.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">Then he said to the disciple, &amp;apos;She is now your mother.&amp;apos; From then on, that disciple took her into his own home.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">Jesus knew that he had now finished his work. And in order to make the Scriptures come true, he said, &amp;apos;I am thirsty!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">A jar of cheap wine was there. Someone then soaked a sponge with the wine and held it up to Jesus' mouth on the stem of a hyssop plant.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">After Jesus drank the wine, he said, &amp;apos;Everything is done!&amp;apos; He bowed his head and died.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">The next day would be both a Sabbath and the Passover. It was a special day for the Jewish people, and they did not want the bodies to stay on the crosses during this day. So they asked Pilate to break the men's legs and take their bodies down.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">The soldiers first broke the legs of the other two men who were nailed there.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">But when they came to Jesus, they saw he was already dead, and they did not break his legs.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">One of the soldiers stuck his spear into Jesus' side, and blood and water came out.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">We know this is true, because it was told by someone who saw it happen. Now you can have faith too.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">All this happened so that the Scriptures would come true, which say, &amp;apos;No bone of his body will be broken&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">and &amp;apos;They will see the one in whose side they stuck a spear.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">Joseph from Arimathea was one of Jesus' disciples. He had kept it secret though, because he was afraid of the Jewish leaders. But now he asked Pilate to let him have Jesus' body. Pilate gave him permission, and Joseph took it down from the cross.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">Nicodemus also came with about 30 kilograms of spices made from myrrh and aloes. This was the same Nicodemus who had visited Jesus one night.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">The two men wrapped the body in a linen cloth, together with the spices, which was how the Jewish people buried their dead.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">In the place where Jesus had been nailed to a cross, there was a garden with a tomb that had never been used.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">The tomb was nearby, and since it was the time to prepare for the Sabbath, they were in a hurry to put Jesus' body there.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="20">
			<VERS vnumber="1">On Sunday morning while it was still dark, Mary Magdalene went to the tomb and saw that the stone had been rolled away from the entrance.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">She ran to Simon Peter and to Jesus' favorite disciple and said, &amp;apos;They have taken the Lord from the tomb! We don't know where they have put him.&amp;apos; She answered, &amp;apos;They have taken away my Lord's body! I don't know where they have put him.&amp;apos; She thought he was the gardener and said, &amp;apos;Sir, if you have taken his body away, please tell me, so I can go and get him.&amp;apos; She turned and said to him, &amp;apos;Rabboni.&amp;apos; The Aramaic word &amp;apos;Rabboni&amp;apos; means &amp;apos;Teacher.&amp;apos; But Thomas said, &amp;apos;First, I must see the nail scars in his hands and touch them with my finger. I must put my hand where the spear went into his side. I won't believe unless I do this!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Peter and the other disciple started for the tomb.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">They ran side by side, until the other disciple ran faster than Peter and got there first.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">He bent over and saw the strips of linen cloth lying inside the tomb, but he did not go in.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">When Simon Peter got there, he went into the tomb and saw the strips of cloth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">He also saw the piece of cloth that had been used to cover Jesus' face. It was rolled up and in a place by itself.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">The disciple who got there first then went into the tomb, and when he saw it, he believed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">At that time Peter and the other disciple did not know that the Scriptures said Jesus would rise to life.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">So the two of them went back to the other disciples.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Mary Magdalene stood crying outside the tomb. She was still weeping, when she stooped down</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">and saw two angels inside. They were dressed in white and were sitting where Jesus' body had been. One was at the head and the other was at the foot.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">The angels asked Mary, &amp;apos;Why are you crying?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">As soon as Mary said this, she turned around and saw Jesus standing there. But she did not know who he was.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Jesus asked her, &amp;apos;Why are you crying? Who are you looking for?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Then Jesus said to her, &amp;apos;Mary!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Jesus told her, &amp;apos;Don't hold on to me! I have not yet gone to the Father. But tell my disciples I am going to the one who is my Father and my God, as well as your Father and your God.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Mary Magdalene then went and told the disciples she had seen the Lord. She also told them what he had said to her.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">The disciples were afraid of the Jewish leaders, and on the evening of that same Sunday they locked themselves in a room. Suddenly, Jesus appeared in the middle of the group. He greeted them</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">and showed them his hands and his side. When the disciples saw the Lord, they became very happy.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">After Jesus had greeted them again, he said, &amp;apos;I am sending you, just as the Father has sent me.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Then he breathed on them and said, &amp;apos;Receive the Holy Spirit.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">If you forgive anyone's sins, they will be forgiven. But if you don't forgive their sins, they will not be forgiven.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">Although Thomas the Twin was one of the twelve disciples, he wasn't with the others when Jesus appeared to them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">So they told him, &amp;apos;We have seen the Lord!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">A week later the disciples were together again. This time, Thomas was with them. Jesus came in while the doors were still locked and stood in the middle of the group. He greeted his disciples</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">and said to Thomas, &amp;apos;Put your finger here and look at my hands! Put your hand into my side. Stop doubting and have faith!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">Thomas replied, &amp;apos;You are my Lord and my God!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">Jesus said, &amp;apos;Thomas, do you have faith because you have seen me? The people who have faith in me without seeing me are the ones who are really blessed!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">Jesus worked many other miracles for his disciples, and not all of them are written in this book.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">But these are written so that you will put your faith in Jesus as the Messiah and the Son of God. If you have faith in him, you will have true life.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="21">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Jesus later appeared to his disciples along the shore of Lake Tiberias.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Simon Peter, Thomas the Twin, Nathanael from Cana in Galilee, and the brothers James and John, were there, together with two other disciples.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Simon Peter said, &amp;apos;I'm going fishing!&amp;apos; The others said, &amp;apos;We will go with you.&amp;apos; They went out in their boat. But they didn't catch a thing that night. &amp;apos;No!&amp;apos; they answered. They did, and the net was so full of fish that they could not drag it up into the boat. Simon Peter answered, &amp;apos;Yes, Lord, you know I do!&amp;apos; &amp;apos;Then feed my lambs,&amp;apos; Jesus said. Peter answered, &amp;apos;Yes, Lord, you know I love you!&amp;apos; &amp;apos;Then take care of my sheep,&amp;apos; Jesus told him. Peter was hurt because Jesus had asked him three times if he loved him. So he told Jesus, &amp;apos;Lord, you know everything. You know I love you.&amp;apos; Jesus replied, &amp;apos;Feed my sheep.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Early the next morning Jesus stood on the shore, but the disciples did not realize who he was.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Jesus shouted, &amp;apos;Friends, have you caught anything?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">So he told them, &amp;apos;Let your net down on the right side of your boat, and you will catch some fish.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Jesus' favorite disciple told Peter, &amp;apos;It's the Lord!&amp;apos; When Simon heard it was the Lord, he put on the clothes he had taken off while he was working. Then he jumped into the water.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">The boat was only about 100 meters from shore. So the other disciples stayed in the boat and dragged in the net full of fish.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">When the disciples got out of the boat, they saw some bread and a charcoal fire with fish on it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Jesus told his disciples, &amp;apos;Bring some of the fish you just caught.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Simon Peter got back into the boat and dragged the net to shore. In it were 153 large fish, but still the net did not rip.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Jesus said, &amp;apos;Come and eat!&amp;apos; But none of the disciples dared ask who he was. They knew he was the Lord.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Jesus took the bread in his hands and gave some of it to his disciples. He did the same with the fish.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">This was the third time Jesus appeared to his disciples after he was raised from death.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">When Jesus and his disciples had finished eating, he asked, &amp;apos;Simon son of John, do you love me more than the others do?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Jesus asked a second time, &amp;apos;Simon son of John, do you love me?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Jesus asked a third time, &amp;apos;Simon son of John, do you love me?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">I tell you for certain that when you were a young man, you dressed yourself and went wherever you wanted to go. But when you are old, you will hold out your hands. Then others will wrap your belt around you and lead you where you don't want to go.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Jesus said this to tell how Peter would die and bring honor to God. Then he said to Peter, &amp;apos;Follow me!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Peter turned and saw Jesus' favorite disciple following them. He was the same one who had sat next to Jesus at the meal and had asked, &amp;apos;Lord, who is going to betray you?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">When Peter saw this disciple, he asked Jesus, &amp;apos;Lord, what about him?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Jesus answered, &amp;apos;What is it to you, if I want him to live until I return? You must follow me.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">So the rumor spread among the other disciples that this disciple would not die. But Jesus did not say he would not die. He simply said, &amp;apos;What is it to you, if I want him to live until I return?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">This disciple is the one who told all of this. He wrote it, and we know he is telling the truth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">Jesus did many other things. If they were all written in books, I don't suppose there would be room enough in the whole world for all the books.</VERS>

	<BIBLEBOOK bnumber="44" bname="Acts">
		<CHAPTER cnumber="1">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Theophilus, I first wrote to you about all that Jesus did and taught from the very first</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">until he was taken up to heaven. But before he was taken up, he gave orders to the apostles he had chosen with the help of the Holy Spirit. Don't leave Jerusalem yet. Wait here for the Father to give you the Holy Spirit, just as I told you he has promised to do. Suddenly two men dressed in white clothes were standing there beside them. After the apostles returned to the city, they went upstairs to the room where they had been staying. My friends, long ago by the power of the Holy Spirit, David said something about Judas, and what he said has now happened. Judas was one of us and had worked with us, but he brought the mob to arrest Jesus. &amp;apos;Leave his house empty, and don't let anyone live there.&amp;apos; It also says, &amp;apos;Let someone else have his job.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">For 40 days after Jesus had suffered and died, he proved in many ways that he had been raised from death. He appeared to his apostles and spoke to them about God's kingdom.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">While he was still with them, he said:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">John baptized with water, but in a few days you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">While the apostles were still with Jesus, they asked him, &amp;apos;Lord, are you now going to give Israel its own king again?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Jesus said to them, &amp;apos;You don't need to know the time of those events that only the Father controls.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">But the Holy Spirit will come upon you and give you power. Then you will tell everyone about me in Jerusalem, in all Judea, in Samaria, and everywhere in the world.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">After Jesus had said this and while they were watching, he was taken up into a cloud. They could not see him,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">but as he went up, they kept looking up into the sky.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">They said, &amp;apos;Why are you men from Galilee standing here and looking up into the sky? Jesus has been taken to heaven. But he will come back in the same way you have seen him go.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">The apostles often met together and prayed with a single purpose in mind. The women and Mary the mother of Jesus would meet with them, and so would his brothers.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">One day there were about 120 of the Lord's followers meeting together, and Peter stood up to speak to them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Then Judas bought some land with the money he was given for doing that evil thing. He fell headfirst into the field. His body burst open, and all his insides came out.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">When the people of Jerusalem found out about this, they called the place Akeldama, which in the local language means &amp;apos;Field of Blood.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">In the book of Psalms it says,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">Two men were suggested: One of them was Joseph Barsabbas, known as Justus, and the other was Matthias.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">Then they all prayed, &amp;apos;Lord, you know what everyone is like! Show us the one you have chosen</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">to be an apostle and to serve in place of Judas, who got what he deserved.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">They drew names, and Matthias was chosen to join the group of the eleven apostles.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="2">
			<VERS vnumber="1">On the day of Pentecost all the Lord's followers were together in one place.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Suddenly there was a noise from heaven like the sound of a mighty wind! It filled the house where they were meeting.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Then they saw what looked like fiery tongues moving in all directions, and a tongue came and settled on each person there.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">The Holy Spirit took control of everyone, and they began speaking whatever languages the Spirit let them speak. Don't all these who are speaking come from Galilee? Friends and everyone else living in Jerusalem, listen carefully to what I have to say! I will give my Spirit to everyone. Your sons and daughters will prophesy. Your young men will see visions, and your old men will have dreams. my Spirit to my servants, both men and women, and they will prophesy. in the sky above and wonders on the earth below. There will be blood and fire and clouds of smoke. and the moon will be as red as blood before the great and wonderful day of the Lord appears. will save everyone who asks for his help.&amp;apos; &amp;apos;I always see the Lord near me, and I will not be afraid with him at my right side. my heart will be glad, my words will be joyful, and I will live in hope. in the grave. I am his holy one, and he won't let my body decay. the path to life, and he makes me glad by being near me.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Many religious Jews from every country in the world were living in Jerusalem.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">And when they heard this noise, a crowd gathered. But they were surprised, because they were hearing everything in their own languages.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">They were excited and amazed, and said:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Then why do we hear them speaking our very own languages?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Some of us are from Parthia, Media, and Elam. Others are from Mesopotamia, Judea, Cappadocia, Pontus, Asia,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Phrygia, Pamphylia, Egypt, parts of Libya near Cyrene, Rome,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Crete, and Arabia. Some of us were born Jews, and others of us have chosen to be Jews. Yet we all hear them using our own languages to tell the wonderful things God has done.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Everyone was excited and confused. Some of them even kept asking each other, &amp;apos;What does all this mean?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Others made fun of the Lord's followers and said, &amp;apos;They are drunk.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Peter stood with the eleven apostles and spoke in a loud and clear voice to the crowd:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">You are wrong to think that these people are drunk. After all, it is only nine o'clock in the morning.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">But this is what God told the prophet Joel to say,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">&amp;apos;When the last days come,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">In those days I will give</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">&amp;apos;I will work miracles</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">The sun will turn dark,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Then the Lord</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Now, listen to what I have to say about Jesus from Nazareth. God proved he sent Jesus to you by having him work miracles, wonders, and signs. All of you know this.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">God had already planned and decided that Jesus would be handed over to you. So you took him and had evil men put him to death on a cross.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">But God set him free from death and raised him to life. Death could not hold him in its power.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">What David said are really the words of Jesus,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">Because of this,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">The Lord won't leave me</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">He has shown me</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">My friends, it is right for me to speak to you about our ancestor David. He died and was buried, and his tomb is still here.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">But David was a prophet, and he knew that God had made a promise he would not break. He had told David someone from his own family would someday be king.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">David knew this would happen, and so he told us Christ would be raised to life. He said God would not leave him in the grave or let his body decay.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">All of us can tell you that God has raised Jesus to life!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">Jesus was taken up to sit at the right side of God, and he was given the Holy Spirit, just as the Father had promised. Jesus is also the one who has given the Spirit to us, and this is what you are now seeing and hearing.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">David didn't go up to heaven. So he wasn't talking about himself when he said, &amp;apos;The Lord told my Lord to sit at his right side,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">until he made my Lord's enemies into a footstool for him.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">Everyone in Israel should then know for certain that God has made Jesus both Lord and Christ, even though you put him to death on a cross.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">When the people heard this, they were very upset. They asked Peter and the other apostles, &amp;apos;Friends, what should we do?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">Peter said to them, &amp;apos;Turn to God and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins, and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">This promise is for you and your children. It is for everyone our Lord God will choose, no matter where they live.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">Peter told them many other things as well. Then he said, &amp;apos;I beg you to save yourselves from what will happen to all these evil people.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">On that day about 3,000 believed his message and were baptized.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">They spent their time learning from the apostles, and they were like family to each other. They also broke bread and prayed together.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43">Everyone was amazed by the many miracles and wonders that the apostles worked.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44">All the Lord's followers often met together, and they shared everything they had.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45">They would sell their property and possessions and give the money to whoever was in need.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46">Day after day they met together in the temple. They broke bread together in different homes and shared their food happily and freely,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="47">while praising God. Everyone liked them, and each day the Lord added to their group others who were being saved.</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="3">
			<VERS vnumber="1">The time of prayer was about three o'clock in the afternoon, and Peter and John were going into the temple.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">A man who had been born lame was being carried to the temple door. Each day he was placed beside this door, known as the Beautiful Gate. He sat there and begged from the people who were going in. At once the man's feet and ankles became strong, Friends, why are you surprised at what has happened? Why are you staring at us? Do you think we have some power of our own? Do you think we were able to make this man walk because we are so religious?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">The man saw Peter and John entering the temple, and he asked them for money.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">But they looked straight at him and said, &amp;apos;Look up at us!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">The man stared at them and thought he was going to get something.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">But Peter said, &amp;apos;I don't have any silver or gold! But I will give you what I do have. In the name of Jesus Christ from Nazareth, get up and start walking.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Peter then took him by the right hand and helped him up.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">and he jumped up and started walking. He went with Peter and John into the temple, walking and jumping and praising God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Everyone saw him walking around and praising God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">They knew he was the beggar who had been lying beside the Beautiful Gate, and they were completely surprised. They could not imagine what had happened to the man.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">While the man kept holding on to Peter and John, the whole crowd ran to them in amazement at the place known as Solomon's Porch.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Peter saw that a crowd had gathered, and he said:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">The God that Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and our other ancestors worshiped has brought honor to his Servant Jesus. He is the one you betrayed. You turned against him when he was being tried by Pilate, even though Pilate wanted to set him free.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">You rejected Jesus, who was holy and good. You asked for a murderer to be set free,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">and you killed the one who leads people to life. But God raised him from death, and all of us can tell you what he has done.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">You see this man, and you know him. He put his faith in the name of Jesus and was made strong. Faith in Jesus made this man completely well while everyone was watching.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">My friends, I am sure you and your leaders didn't know what you were doing.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">But God had his prophets tell that his Messiah would suffer, and now he has kept this promise.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">So turn to God! Give up your sins, and you will be forgiven.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Then the time will come when the Lord will give you fresh strength. He will send you Jesus, his chosen Messiah.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">But Jesus must stay in heaven until God makes all things new, just as his holy prophets promised long ago.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Moses said, &amp;apos;The Lord your God will choose one of your own people to be a prophet, just as he chose me. Listen to everything he tells you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">No one who disobeys this prophet will be one of God's people any longer.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">Samuel and all the other prophets who came later also spoke about what is now happening.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">You are really the ones God told his prophets to speak to. And you were given the promise God made to your ancestors. He said to Abraham, &amp;apos;All nations on earth will be blessed because of someone from your family.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">God sent his chosen Son to you first, because God wanted to bless you and make each one of you turn away from your sins.</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="4">
			<VERS vnumber="1">The apostles were still talking to the people, when some priests, the captain of the temple guard, and some Sadducees arrived.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">These men were angry because the apostles were teaching the people that the dead would be raised from death, just as Jesus had been raised from death.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">It was already late in the afternoon, and they arrested Peter and John and put them in jail for the night.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">But a lot of people who had heard the message believed it. So by now there were about 5,000 followers of the Lord. Master, you created heaven and earth, the sea, and everything in them. &amp;apos;Why are all the Gentiles so furious? Why do people make foolish plans? prepare for war, and the rulers join together against the Lord and his Messiah.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">The next morning the leaders, the elders, and the teachers of the Law of Moses met in Jerusalem.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">The high priest Annas was there, as well as Caiaphas, John, Alexander, and other members of the high priest's family.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">They brought in Peter and John and made them stand in the middle while they questioned them. They asked, &amp;apos;By what power and in whose name have you done this?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Peter was filled with the Holy Spirit and told the nation's leaders and the elders:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">You are questioning us today about a kind deed in which a man who could not walk was healed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">But there is something we must tell you and everyone else in Israel. This man is standing here completely well because of the power of Jesus Christ from Nazareth. You put Jesus to death on a cross, but God raised him to life.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">He is the stone you builders thought was worthless, and now he is the most important stone of all.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Only Jesus has the power to save! His name is the only one in all the world that can save anyone.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">The officials were amazed to see how brave Peter and John were, and they knew that these two apostles were only ordinary men and not well educated. The officials were certain these men had been with Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">But they could not deny what had happened. The man who had been healed was standing there with the apostles.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">The officials commanded them to leave the council room. Then the officials said to each other,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">&amp;apos;What can we do with these men? Everyone in Jerusalem knows about this miracle, and we cannot say it didn't happen.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">But to keep this thing from spreading, we will warn them never again to speak to anyone about the name of Jesus.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">So they called the two apostles back in and told them they must never, for any reason, teach anything about the name of Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Peter and John answered, &amp;apos;Do you think God wants us to obey you or to obey him?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">We cannot keep quiet about what we have seen and heard.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">As soon as Peter and John had been set free, they went back and told the others everything the chief priests and the leaders had said to them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">When the rest of the Lord's followers heard this, they prayed together and said:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">And by the Holy Spirit you spoke to our ancestor David. He was your servant, and you told him to say:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">The kings of earth</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">Here in Jerusalem, Herod and Pontius Pilate got together with the Gentiles and the people of Israel. Then they turned against your holy Servant Jesus, your chosen Messiah.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">They did what you in your power and wisdom had already decided would happen.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">Lord, listen to their threats! We are your servants. So make us brave enough to speak your message.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">Show your mighty power, as we heal people and work miracles and wonders in the name of your holy Servant Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">After they had prayed, the meeting place shook. They were all filled with the Holy Spirit and bravely spoke God's message.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">The group of followers all felt the same way about everything. None of them claimed that their possessions were their own, and they shared everything they had with each other.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">In a powerful way the apostles told everyone that the Lord Jesus was now alive. God greatly blessed his followers,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">and no one went in need of anything. Everyone who owned land or houses would sell them and bring the money</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">to the apostles. Then they would give the money to anyone in need.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="5">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Ananias and his wife Sapphira also sold a piece of property.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">But they agreed to cheat and keep some of the money for themselves. So when Ananias took the rest of the money to the apostles, &amp;apos;Yes,&amp;apos; she answered, &amp;apos;that's the amount.&amp;apos; When the young men came back in, they found Sapphira lying there dead. So they carried her out and buried her beside her husband. The high priest and his men called together their council, which included all of Israel's leaders. Then they ordered the apostles to be brought to them from the jail. We don't obey people. We obey God. Men of Israel, be careful what you do with these men. The council members agreed with what he said,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Peter said, &amp;apos;Why has Satan made you keep back some of the money from the sale of the property? Why have you lied to the Holy Spirit?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">The property was yours before you sold it, and even after you sold it, the money was still yours. What made you do such a thing? You didn't lie to people. You lied to God!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">As soon as Ananias heard this, he dropped dead, and everyone who heard about it was frightened.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Some young men came in and wrapped up his body. Then they took it out and buried it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Three hours later Sapphira came in, but she did not know what had happened to her husband.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Peter asked her, &amp;apos;Tell me, did you sell the property for this amount?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Then Peter said, &amp;apos;Why did the two of you agree to test the Lord's Spirit? The men who buried Ananias are by the door, and they will carry you out!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">At once she fell at Peter's feet and died.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">The church members were afraid, and so was everyone else who heard what had happened.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">The apostles worked many miracles and wonders among the people. All of the Lord's followers often met in the part of the temple known as Solomon's Porch.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">No one outside their group dared join them, even though everyone liked them very much.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Many men and women started having faith in the Lord.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Then sick people were brought out to the road and placed on mats. It was hoped that Peter would walk by, and his shadow would fall on them and heal them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">A lot of people living in the towns near Jerusalem brought those who were sick or troubled by evil spirits, and they were all healed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">The high priest and all the other Sadducees who were with him became jealous.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">They arrested the apostles and put them in the city jail.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">But that night an angel from the Lord opened the doors of the jail and led the apostles out. The angel said,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">&amp;apos;Go to the temple and tell the people everything about this new life.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">So they went into the temple before sunrise and started teaching.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">The temple police who were sent to the jail did not find the apostles. They returned and said,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">&amp;apos;We found the jail locked tight and the guards standing at the doors. But when we opened the doors and went in, we didn't find anyone there.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">The captain of the temple police and the chief priests listened to their report, but they did not know what to think about it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">Just then someone came in and said, &amp;apos;Now those men you put in jail are in the temple, teaching the people!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">The captain went with some of the temple police and brought the apostles back. But they did not use force. They were afraid that the people might start throwing stones at them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">When the apostles were brought before the council, the high priest said to them,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">&amp;apos;We told you plainly not to teach in the name of Jesus. But look what you have done! You have been teaching all over Jerusalem, and you are trying to blame us for his death.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">Peter and the apostles replied:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">You killed Jesus by nailing him to a cross. But the God our ancestors worshiped raised him to life</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">and made him our Leader and Savior. Then God gave him a place at his right side, so that the people of Israel would turn back to him and be forgiven.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">We are here to tell you about all this, and so is the Holy Spirit, who is God's gift to everyone who obeys God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">When the council members heard this, they became so angry they wanted to kill the apostles.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">But one of the members was the Pharisee Gamaliel, a highly respected teacher. He ordered the apostles to be taken out of the room for a little while.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">Then he said to the council:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">Not long ago Theudas claimed to be someone important, and about 400 men joined him. But he was killed, and all his followers were scattered. That was the end of that.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">Later, when the people of our nation were being counted, Judas from Galilee showed up. A lot of people followed him, but he was killed, and all his followers were scattered.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">So I advise you to stay away from these men. Leave them alone. If what they are planning is something of their own doing, it will fail.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">But if God is behind it, you cannot stop it anyway, unless you want to fight against God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">and they called the apostles back in. They had them beaten with a whip and warned them not to speak in the name of Jesus. Then they let them go.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">The apostles left the council and were happy, because God had considered them worthy to suffer for the sake of Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">Every day they spent time in the temple and in one home after another. They never stopped teaching and telling the good news that Jesus is the Messiah.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="6">
			<VERS vnumber="1">A lot of people were now becoming followers of the Lord. But some of the ones who spoke Greek started complaining about the ones who spoke Aramaic. They complained that the Greek-speaking widows were not given their share when the food supplies were handed out each day.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">The twelve apostles called the whole group of followers together and said, &amp;apos;We should not give up preaching God's message in order to serve at tables.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">My friends, choose seven men who are respected and wise and filled with God's Spirit. We will put them in charge of these things.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">We can spend our time praying and serving God by preaching.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">This suggestion pleased everyone, and they began by choosing Stephen. He had great faith and was filled with the Holy Spirit. Then they chose Philip, Prochorus, Nicanor, Timon, Parmenas, and also Nicolaus, who worshiped with the Jewish people in Antioch.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">These men were brought to the apostles. Then the apostles prayed and placed their hands on the men to show they had been chosen to do this work.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">God's message spread, and many more people in Jerusalem became followers. Even a large number of priests put their faith in the Lord.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">God gave Stephen the power to work great miracles and wonders among the people.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">But some men from Cyrene and Alexandria were members of a group who called themselves &amp;apos;Free Men.&amp;apos; They started arguing with Stephen. Some others from Cilicia and Asia also argued with him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">But they were no match for Stephen, who spoke with the great wisdom that the Spirit gave him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">So they talked some men into saying, &amp;apos;We heard Stephen say terrible things against Moses and God!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">They turned the people and their leaders and the teachers of the Law of Moses against Stephen. Then they all grabbed him and dragged him in front of the council.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Some men agreed to tell lies about Stephen, and they said, &amp;apos;This man keeps on saying terrible things about this holy temple and the Law of Moses.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">We have heard him claim that Jesus from Nazareth will destroy this place and change the customs Moses gave us.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Then all the council members stared at Stephen. They saw that his face looked like the face of an angel.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="7">
			<VERS vnumber="1">The high priest asked Stephen, &amp;apos;Are they telling the truth about you?&amp;apos; Friends, listen to me. Our glorious God appeared to our ancestor Abraham while he was still in Mesopotamia, before he had moved to Haran. After his father died, Abraham came and settled in this land where you now live. Joseph was also one of our famous ancestors. His brothers were jealous of him and sold him as a slave to be taken to Egypt. But God was with him and the earth is my footstool. What kind of house will you build for me? In what place will I rest?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Stephen answered:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">God told him, &amp;apos;Leave your country and your relatives and go to a land that I will show you.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Then Abraham left the land of the Chaldeans and settled in Haran.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">God didn't give him any part of it, not even a square meter. But God did promise to give it to him and his family forever, even though Abraham didn't have any children.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">God said Abraham's descendants would live for a while in a foreign land. There they would be slaves and would be mistreated 400 years.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">But he also said, &amp;apos;I will punish the nation that makes them slaves. Then later they will come and worship me in this place.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">God said to Abraham, &amp;apos;Every son in each family must be circumcised to show you have kept your agreement with me.&amp;apos; So when Isaac was eight days old, Abraham circumcised him. Later, Isaac circumcised his son Jacob, and Jacob circumcised his twelve sons.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">These men were our ancestors.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">and rescued him from all his troubles. God made him so wise that the Egyptian king Pharaoh thought highly of him. The king even made Joseph governor over Egypt and put him in charge of everything he owned.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Everywhere in Egypt and Canaan the grain crops failed. There was terrible suffering, and our ancestors could not find enough to eat.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">But when Jacob heard there was grain in Egypt, he sent our ancestors there for the first time.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">It was on their second trip that Joseph told his brothers who he was, and the king learned about Joseph's family.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Joseph sent for his father and his relatives. In all, there were 75 of them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">His father went to Egypt and died there, just as our ancestors did.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Later their bodies were taken back to Shechem and placed in the tomb that Abraham had bought from the sons of Hamor.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Finally, the time came for God to do what he had promised Abraham. By then the number of our people in Egypt had greatly increased.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Another king was ruling Egypt, and he didn't know anything about Joseph.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">He tricked our ancestors and was cruel to them. He even made them leave their babies outside, so they would die.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">During this time Moses was born. He was a very beautiful child, and for three months his parents took care of him in their home.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Then when they were forced to leave him outside, the king's daughter found him and raised him as her own son.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Moses was given the best education in Egypt. He was a strong man and a powerful speaker.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">When Moses was 40 years old, he wanted to help the Israelites because they were his own people.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">One day he saw an Egyptian mistreating one of them. So he rescued the man and killed the Egyptian.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">Moses thought the rest of his people would realize God was going to use him to set them free. But they didn't understand.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">The next day Moses saw two of his own people fighting, and he tried to make them stop. He said, &amp;apos;Men, you are both Israelites. Why are you so cruel to each other?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">But the man who had started the fight pushed Moses aside and asked, &amp;apos;Who made you our ruler and judge?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">Are you going to kill me, just as you killed that Egyptian yesterday?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">When Moses heard this, he ran away to live in the country of Midian. His two sons were born there.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">Forty years later, an angel appeared to Moses from a burning bush in the desert near Mount Sinai.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">Moses was surprised by what he saw. He went closer to get a better look, and the Lord said,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">&amp;apos;I am the God who was worshiped by your ancestors, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.&amp;apos; Moses started shaking all over and didn't dare to look at the bush.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">The Lord said to him, &amp;apos;Take off your sandals, because the place where you are standing is holy.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">With my own eyes I have seen the suffering of my people in Egypt. I have heard their groans and have come down to rescue them. Now I am sending you back to Egypt.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">This was the same Moses that the people rejected by saying, &amp;apos;Who made you our leader and judge?&amp;apos; God's angel had spoken to Moses from the bush. And God had even sent the angel to help Moses rescue the people and be their leader.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">In Egypt and at the Red Sea and in the desert, Moses rescued the people by working miracles and wonders for 40 years.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">Moses is the one who told the people of Israel, &amp;apos;God will choose one of your people to be a prophet, just as he chose me.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">Moses brought our people together in the desert, and the angel spoke to him on Mount Sinai. There he was given these life-giving words to pass on to us.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">But our ancestors refused to obey Moses. They rejected him and wanted to go back to Egypt.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">The people said to Aaron, &amp;apos;Make some gods to lead us! Moses led us out of Egypt, but we don't know what's happened to him now.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">Then they made an idol in the shape of a calf. They offered sacrifices to the idol and were pleased with what they had done.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">God turned his back on his people and left them. Then they worshiped the stars in the sky, just as it says in the Book of the Prophets, &amp;apos;People of Israel, you didn't offer sacrifices and offerings to me during those 40 years in the desert.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43">Instead, you carried the tent where the god Molech is worshiped, and you took along the star of your god Rephan. You made those idols and worshiped them. So now I will have you carried off beyond Babylonia.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44">The tent where our ancestors worshiped God was with them in the desert. This was the same tent that God had commanded Moses to make. And it was made like the model that Moses had seen.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45">Later it was given to our ancestors, and they took it with them when they went with Joshua. They carried the tent along as they took over the land from those people that God had chased out for them. Our ancestors used this tent until the time of King David.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46">He pleased God and asked him if he could build a house of worship for the people of Israel.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="47">And it was finally King Solomon who built a house for God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="48">But the Most High God doesn't live in houses made by humans. It is just as the prophet said, when he spoke for the Lord,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="49">&amp;apos;Heaven is my throne,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="50">I have made everything.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="51">You stubborn and hardheaded people! You are always fighting against the Holy Spirit, just as your ancestors did.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="52">Is there one prophet that your ancestors didn't mistreat? They killed the prophets who told about the coming of the One Who Obeys God. And now you have turned against him and killed him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="53">Angels gave you God's Law, but you still don't obey it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="54">When the council members heard Stephen's speech, they were angry and furious.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="55">But Stephen was filled with the Holy Spirit. He looked toward heaven, where he saw our glorious God and Jesus standing at his right side.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="56">Then Stephen said, &amp;apos;I see heaven open and the Son of Man standing at the right side of God!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="57">The council members shouted and covered their ears. At once they all attacked Stephen</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="58">and dragged him out of the city. Then they started throwing stones at him. The men who had brought charges against him put their coats at the feet of a young man named Saul.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="59">As Stephen was being stoned to death, he called out, &amp;apos;Lord Jesus, please welcome me!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="60">He knelt down and shouted, &amp;apos;Lord, don't blame them for what they have done.&amp;apos; Then he died.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="8">
			<VERS vnumber="3">Saul started making a lot of trouble for the church. He went from house to house, arresting men and women and putting them in jail.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">The Lord's followers who had been scattered went from place to place, telling the good news.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Philip went to the city of Samaria and told the people about Christ.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">They crowded around Philip because they were eager to hear what he was saying and to see him work miracles.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Many people with evil spirits were healed, and the spirits went out of them with a shout. A lot of paralyzed and lame people were also healed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Everyone in that city was very glad because of what was happening.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">For some time a man named Simon had lived there and had amazed the people of Samaria. He practiced witchcraft and claimed to be somebody great.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Everyone, rich and poor, crowded around him. They said, &amp;apos;This man is the power of God called &amp;quot;The Great Power.&amp;quot; &amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">For a long time, Simon had used witchcraft to amaze the people, and they kept crowding around him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">But when they believed what Philip was saying about God's kingdom and about the name of Jesus Christ, they were all baptized.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Even Simon believed and was baptized. He stayed close to Philip, because he marveled at all the miracles and wonders.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">The apostles in Jerusalem heard that some people in Samaria had accepted God's message, and they sent Peter and John.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">When the two apostles arrived, they prayed that these people would be given the Holy Spirit.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Before this, the Holy Spirit had not been given to any of them, though some of them had been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Peter and John then placed their hands on everyone who had faith in the Lord, and they were given the Holy Spirit.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Simon noticed that the Spirit was given only when the apostles placed their hands on the people. So he brought money</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">and said to Peter and John, &amp;apos;Let me have this power too! Then anyone I place my hands on will also be given the Holy Spirit.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Peter said to him, &amp;apos;You and your money will both end up in hell if you think you can buy God's gift!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">You don't have any part in this, and God sees that your heart isn't right.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Get rid of these evil thoughts and ask God to forgive you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">I can see that you are jealous and bound by your evil ways.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">Simon said, &amp;apos;Please pray to the Lord, so that what you said won't happen to me.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">After Peter and John had preached about the Lord, they returned to Jerusalem. On their way they told the good news in many villages of Samaria.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">The Lord's angel said to Philip, &amp;apos;Go south along the desert road that leads from Jerusalem to Gaza.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">So Philip left.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">and was now on his way home. He was sitting in his chariot, reading the book of the prophet Isaiah.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">The Spirit told Philip to catch up with the chariot.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">Philip ran up close and heard the man reading aloud from the book of Isaiah. Philip asked him, &amp;apos;Do you understand what you are reading?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">The official answered, &amp;apos;How can I understand unless someone helps me?&amp;apos; He then invited Philip to come up and sit beside him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">The man was reading the passage that said,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">He was treated like a nobody</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">The official said to Philip, &amp;apos;Tell me, was the prophet talking about himself or about someone else?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">So Philip began at this place in the Scriptures and explained the good news about Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">He ordered the chariot to stop. Then they both went down into the water, and Philip baptized him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">After they had come out of the water, the Lord's Spirit took Philip away. The official never saw him again, but he was very happy as he went on his way.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">Philip later appeared in Azotus. He went from town to town, all the way to Caesarea, telling people about Jesus.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="9">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Saul kept on threatening to kill the Lord's followers. He even went to the high priest</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">and asked for letters to the leaders of the synagogues in Damascus. He did this because he wanted to arrest and take to Jerusalem any man or woman who had accepted the Lord's Way.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">When Saul had almost reached Damascus, a bright light from heaven suddenly flashed around him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">He fell to the ground and heard a voice saying, &amp;apos;Saul! Saul! Why are you so cruel to me?&amp;apos; &amp;apos;I am Jesus,&amp;apos; the Lord answered. &amp;apos;I am the one you are so cruel to. For several days Saul stayed with the Lord's followers in Damascus. The men took Peter upstairs into the room. Many widows were there crying. They showed him the coats and clothes that Dorcas had made while she was still alive. Peter called in the widows and the other followers and showed them that Dorcas had been raised from death.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">&amp;apos;Who are you?&amp;apos; Saul asked.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Now get up and go into the city, where you will be told what to do.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">The men with Saul stood there speechless. They had heard the voice, but they had not seen anyone.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Saul got up from the ground, and when he opened his eyes, he could not see a thing. Someone then led him by the hand to Damascus,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">and for three days he was blind and did not eat or drink.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">A follower named Ananias lived in Damascus, and the Lord spoke to him in a vision. Ananias answered, &amp;apos;Lord, here I am.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">The Lord said to him, &amp;apos;Get up and go to the house of Judas on Straight Street. When you get there, you will find a man named Saul from the city of Tarsus. Saul is praying,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">and he has seen a vision. He saw a man named Ananias coming to him and putting his hands on him, so he could see again.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Ananias replied, &amp;apos;Lord, a lot of people have told me about the terrible things this man has done to your followers in Jerusalem.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Now the chief priests have given him the power to come here and arrest anyone who worships in your name.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">The Lord said to Ananias, &amp;apos;Go! I have chosen him to tell foreigners, kings, and the people of Israel about me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">I will show him how much he must suffer for worshiping in my name.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Ananias left and went into the house where Saul was staying. Ananias placed his hands on him and said, &amp;apos;Saul, the Lord Jesus has sent me. He is the same one who appeared to you along the road. He wants you to be able to see and to be filled with the Holy Spirit.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Suddenly something like fish scales fell from Saul's eyes, and he could see. He got up and was baptized.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Then he ate and felt much better.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Soon he went to the synagogues and started telling people that Jesus is the Son of God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Everyone who heard Saul was amazed and said, &amp;apos;Isn't this the man who caused so much trouble for those people in Jerusalem who worship in the name of Jesus? Didn't he come here to arrest them and take them to the chief priests?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Saul preached with such power that he completely confused the Jewish people in Damascus, as he tried to show them that Jesus is the Messiah.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">Later some of them made plans to kill Saul,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">but he found out about it. He learned that they were guarding the gates of the city day and night in order to kill him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">Then one night his followers let him down over the city wall in a large basket.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">When Saul arrived in Jerusalem, he tried to join the followers. But they were all afraid of him, because they did not believe he was a true follower.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">Then Barnabas helped him by taking him to the apostles. He explained how Saul had seen the Lord and how the Lord had spoken to him. Barnabas also said when Saul was in Damascus, he had spoken bravely in the name of Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">Saul moved about freely with the followers in Jerusalem and told everyone about the Lord.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">He was always arguing with the Jews who spoke Greek, and so they tried to kill him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">But the followers found out about this and took Saul to Caesarea. From there they sent him to the city of Tarsus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">The church in Judea, Galilee, and Samaria now had a time of peace and kept on worshiping the Lord. The church became stronger, as the Holy Spirit encouraged it and helped it grow.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">While Peter was traveling from place to place, he visited the Lord's followers who lived in the town of Lydda.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">There he met a man named Aeneas, who for eight years had been sick in bed and could not move.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">Peter said to Aeneas, &amp;apos;Jesus Christ has healed you! Get up and make up your bed.&amp;apos; At once he stood up.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">Many people in the towns of Lydda and Sharon saw Aeneas and became followers of the Lord.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">In Joppa there was a follower named Tabitha. Her Greek name was Dorcas, which means &amp;apos;deer.&amp;apos; She was always doing good things for people and had given much to the poor.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">But she got sick and died, and her body was washed and placed in an upstairs room.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">Joppa wasn't far from Lydda, and the followers heard that Peter was there. They sent two men to say to him, &amp;apos;Please come with us as quickly as you can!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">At once, Peter went with them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">After Peter had sent everyone out of the room, he knelt down and prayed. Then he turned to the body of Dorcas and said, &amp;apos;Tabitha, get up!&amp;apos; The woman opened her eyes, and when she saw Peter, she sat up.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">He took her by the hand and helped her to her feet.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">Everyone in Joppa heard what had happened, and many of them put their faith in the Lord.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43">Peter stayed on for a while in Joppa in the house of a man named Simon, who made leather.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="10">
			<VERS vnumber="1">In Caesarea there was a man named Cornelius, who was the captain of a group of soldiers called &amp;apos;The Italian Unit.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Cornelius was a very religious man. He worshiped God, and so did everyone else who lived in his house. He had given a lot of money to the poor and was always praying to God. The angel answered, &amp;apos;God has heard your prayers and knows about your gifts to the poor. Cornelius called in two of his servants and one of his soldiers who worshiped God. The next morning, Peter and some of the Lord's followers in Joppa left with the men who had come from Cornelius. Four days ago at about three o'clock in the afternoon I was praying at home. Suddenly a man in bright clothes stood in front of me. Now I am certain that God treats all people alike. Jesus was put to death on a cross. Peter said,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">One afternoon at about three o'clock, Cornelius had a vision. He saw an angel from God coming to him and calling him by name.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Cornelius was surprised and stared at the angel. Then he asked, &amp;apos;What is this all about?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Now send some men to Joppa for a man named Simon Peter.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">He is staying with Simon the leather maker, who lives in a house near the sea.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">After saying this, the angel left.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">He explained everything to them and sent them off to Joppa.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">The next day about noon these men were coming near Joppa. Peter went up on the roof of the house to pray</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">and became very hungry. While the food was being prepared, he fell sound asleep and had a vision.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">He saw heaven open, and something came down like a huge sheet held up by its four corners.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">In it were all kinds of animals, reptiles, and birds.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">A voice said to him, &amp;apos;Peter, get up! Kill these and eat them.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">But Peter said, &amp;apos;Lord, I can't do that! I've never eaten anything that is unclean and not fit to eat.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">The voice spoke to him again, &amp;apos;When God says that something can be used for food, don't say it isn't fit to eat.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">This happened three times before the sheet was suddenly taken back to heaven.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Peter was still wondering what all this meant, when the men sent by Cornelius came and stood at the gate. They had found their way to Simon's house</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">and were asking if Simon Peter was staying there.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">While Peter was still thinking about the vision, the Holy Spirit said to him, &amp;apos;Three men are here looking for you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Hurry down and go with them. Don't worry, I sent them.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Peter went down and said to the men, &amp;apos;I am the one you are looking for. Why have you come?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">They answered, &amp;apos;Captain Cornelius sent us. He is a good man who worships God and is liked by the Jewish people. One of God's holy angels told Cornelius to send for you, so he could hear what you have to say.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">Peter invited them to spend the night.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">The next day they arrived in Caesarea where Cornelius was waiting for them. He had also invited his relatives and close friends.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">When Peter arrived, Cornelius greeted him. Then he knelt at Peter's feet and started worshiping him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">But Peter took hold of him and said, &amp;apos;Stand up! I am nothing more than a human.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">As Peter entered the house, he was still talking with Cornelius. Many people were there,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">and Peter said to them, &amp;apos;You know that we Jews are not allowed to have anything to do with other people. But God has shown me that he doesn't think anyone is unclean or unfit.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">I agreed to come here, but I want to know why you sent for me.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">Cornelius answered:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">He said, &amp;apos;Cornelius, God has heard your prayers, and he knows about your gifts to the poor.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">Now send to Joppa for Simon Peter. He is visiting in the home of Simon the leather maker, who lives near the sea.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">I sent for you at once, and you have been good enough to come. All of us are here in the presence of the Lord God, so that we can hear what he has to say.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">Peter then said:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">God is pleased with everyone who worships him and does right, no matter what nation they come from.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">This is the same message that God gave to the people of Israel, when he sent Jesus Christ, the Lord of all, to offer peace to them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">You surely know what happened everywhere in Judea. It all began in Galilee after John had told everyone to be baptized.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">God gave the Holy Spirit and power to Jesus from Nazareth. He was with Jesus, as he went around doing good and healing everyone who was under the power of the devil.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">We all saw what Jesus did both in Israel and in the city of Jerusalem.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">But three days later, God raised him to life and let him be seen.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">Not everyone saw him. He was seen only by us, who ate and drank with him after he was raised from death. We were the ones God chose to tell others about him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">God told us to announce clearly to the people that Jesus is the one he has chosen to judge the living and the dead.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43">Every one of the prophets has said that all who have faith in Jesus will have their sins forgiven in his name.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44">While Peter was still speaking, the Holy Spirit took control of everyone who was listening.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45">Some Jewish followers of the Lord had come with Peter, and they were surprised that the Holy Spirit had been given to Gentiles.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46">Now they were hearing Gentiles speaking unknown languages and praising God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="47">&amp;apos;These Gentiles have been given the Holy Spirit, just as we have! I am certain that no one would dare stop us from baptizing them.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="48">Peter ordered them to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ, and they asked him to stay on for a few days.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="11">
			<VERS vnumber="1">The apostles and the followers in Judea heard that Gentiles had accepted God's message.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">So when Peter came to Jerusalem, some of the Jewish followers started arguing with him. They wanted Gentile followers to be circumcised, and</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">they said, &amp;apos;You stayed in the homes of Gentiles, and you even ate with them!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Then Peter told them exactly what had happened:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">I was in the town of Joppa and was praying when I fell sound asleep and had a vision. I saw heaven open, and something like a huge sheet held by its four corners came down to me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">When I looked in it, I saw animals, wild beasts, reptiles, and birds.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">I heard a voice saying to me, &amp;apos;Peter, get up! Kill these and eat them.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">But I said, &amp;apos;Lord, I can't do that! I've never taken a bite of anything that is unclean and not fit to eat.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">The voice from heaven spoke to me again, &amp;apos;When God says that something can be used for food, don't say it isn't fit to eat.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">This happened three times before it was all taken back into heaven.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Suddenly three men from Caesarea stood in front of the house where I was staying.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">The Holy Spirit told me to go with them and not to worry. Then six of the Lord's followers went with me to the home of a man</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">who told us that an angel had appeared to him. The angel had ordered him to send to Joppa for someone named Simon Peter.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Then Peter would tell him how he and everyone in his house could be saved.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">After I started speaking, the Holy Spirit was given to them, just as the Spirit had been given to us at the beginning.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">I remembered that the Lord had said, &amp;apos;John baptized with water, but you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">God gave those Gentiles the same gift that he gave us when we put our faith in the Lord Jesus Christ. So how could I have gone against God?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">When they heard Peter say this, they stopped arguing and started praising God. They said, &amp;apos;God has now let Gentiles turn to him, and he has given life to them!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Some of the Lord's followers had been scattered because of the terrible trouble that started when Stephen was killed. They went as far as Phoenicia, Cyprus, and Antioch, but they told the message only to the Jews.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Some of the followers from Cyprus and Cyrene went to Antioch and started telling Gentiles the good news about the Lord Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">The Lord's power was with them, and many people turned to the Lord and put their faith in him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">News of what was happening reached the church in Jerusalem. Then they sent Barnabas to Antioch.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">When Barnabas got there and saw how God had blessed them with undeserved grace, he was very glad. So he begged them to remain faithful to the Lord with all their hearts.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">Barnabas was a good man of great faith, and he was filled with the Holy Spirit. Many more people turned to the Lord.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">Barnabas went to Tarsus to look for Saul.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">He found Saul and brought him to Antioch, where they met with the church for a whole year and taught many of its people. There in Antioch the Lord's followers were first called Christians.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">During this time some prophets from Jerusalem came to Antioch.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">One of them was Agabus. Then with the help of the Spirit, he told that there would be a terrible famine everywhere in the world. And it happened when Claudius was Emperor.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">The followers in Antioch decided to send whatever help they could to the followers in Judea.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">So they appointed Barnabas and Saul to take their gifts to the church leaders in Jerusalem.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="12">
			<VERS vnumber="1">At that time King Herod caused terrible suffering for some members of the church.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">He ordered soldiers to cut off the head of James, the brother of John.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">When Herod saw that this pleased the Jewish people, he had Peter arrested during the Festival of Thin Bread.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">He put Peter in jail and ordered four squads of soldiers to guard him. Herod planned to put him on trial in public after the festival. The chains fell off his hands, Herod came dressed in his royal robes. He sat down on his throne and made a speech.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">While Peter was being kept in jail, the church never stopped praying to God for him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">The night before Peter was to be put on trial, he was asleep and bound by two chains. A soldier was guarding him on each side, and two other soldiers were guarding the entrance to the jail.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Suddenly an angel from the Lord appeared, and light flashed around in the cell. The angel poked Peter in the side and woke him up. Then he said, &amp;apos;Quick! Get up!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">and the angel said, &amp;apos;Get dressed and put on your sandals.&amp;apos; Peter did what he was told. Then the angel said, &amp;apos;Now put on your coat and follow me.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Peter left with the angel, but he thought everything was only a dream.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">They went past the two groups of soldiers, and when they came to the iron gate to the city, it opened by itself. They went out and were going along the street, when all at once the angel disappeared.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Peter now realized what had happened, and he said, &amp;apos;I am certain that the Lord sent his angel to rescue me from Herod and from everything the Jewish leaders planned to do to me.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Then Peter went to the house of Mary the mother of John whose other name was Mark. Many of the Lord's followers had come together there and were praying.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Peter knocked on the gate, and a servant named Rhoda came to answer.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">When she heard Peter's voice, she was too excited to open the gate. She ran back into the house and said Peter was standing there.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">&amp;apos;You are crazy!&amp;apos; everyone told her. But she kept saying it was Peter. Then they said, &amp;apos;It must be his angel.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">But Peter kept on knocking, until finally they opened the gate. They saw him and were completely amazed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Peter motioned for them to keep quiet. Then he told how the Lord had led him out of jail. He also said, &amp;apos;Tell James and the others what has happened.&amp;apos; After that, he left and went somewhere else.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">The next morning the soldiers who had been on guard were terribly worried and wondered what had happened to Peter.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Herod ordered his own soldiers to search for him, but they could not find him. Then he questioned the guards and had them put to death. After this, Herod left Judea to stay in Caesarea for a while.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Herod and the people of Tyre and Sidon were very angry with each other. But their country got its food supply from the region that he ruled. So a group of them went to see Blastus, who was one of Herod's high officials. They convinced Blastus that they wanted to make peace between their cities and Herod,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">and a day was set for them to meet with him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">The people shouted, &amp;apos;You speak more like a god than a man!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">At once an angel from the Lord struck him down because he took the honor that belonged to God. Later, Herod was eaten by worms and died.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">God's message kept spreading.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">And after Barnabas and Saul had done the work they were sent to do, they went back to Jerusalem with John, whose other name was Mark.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="13">
			<VERS vnumber="1">The church at Antioch had several prophets and teachers. They were Barnabas, Simeon, also called Niger, Lucius from Cyrene, Manaen, who was Herod's close friend, and Saul.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">While they were worshiping the Lord and going without eating, the Holy Spirit told them, &amp;apos;Appoint Barnabas and Saul to do the work for which I have chosen them.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Everyone prayed and went without eating for a while longer. Next, they placed their hands on Barnabas and Saul to show that they had been appointed to do this work. Then everyone sent them on their way. Suddenly the man's eyes were covered by a dark mist, and he went around trying to get someone to lead him by the hand. People of Israel, and everyone else who worships God, listen! Then God gave our people judges until the time of the prophet Samuel, &amp;apos;You are my son because today I have become your Father.&amp;apos; &amp;apos;I will make to you the same holy promises that I made to David.&amp;apos; who make fun of God! Be amazed and disappear. I will do something today that you won't believe, even if someone tells you about it!&amp;apos; We had to tell God's message to you before we told it to anyone else. But you rejected the message! This proves that you don't deserve eternal life. Now we are going to the Gentiles. &amp;apos;I have placed you here as a light for the Gentiles. You are to take the saving power of God to people everywhere on earth.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">After Barnabas and Saul had been sent by the Holy Spirit, they went to Seleucia. From there they sailed to the island of Cyprus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">They arrived at Salamis and began to preach God's message in the synagogues. They also had John as a helper.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Barnabas and Saul went all the way to the city of Paphos on the other end of the island, where they met a Jewish man named Bar-Jesus. He practiced witchcraft and was a false prophet.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">He also worked for Sergius Paulus, who was very smart and was the governor of the island. Sergius Paulus wanted to hear God's message, and he sent for Barnabas and Saul.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">But Bar-Jesus, whose other name was Elymas, was against them. He even tried to keep the governor from having faith in the Lord.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Then Saul, better known as Paul, was filled with the Holy Spirit. He looked straight at Elymas</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">and said, &amp;apos;You son of the devil! You are a liar, a crook, and an enemy of everything that is right. When will you stop speaking against the true ways of the Lord?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">The Lord is going to punish you by making you completely blind for a while.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">When the governor saw what had happened, he was amazed at this teaching about the Lord. So he put his faith in the Lord.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Paul and the others left Paphos and sailed to Perga in Pamphylia. But John left them and went back to Jerusalem.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">The rest of them went on from Perga to Antioch in Pisidia. Then on the Sabbath they went to the synagogue and sat down.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">After the reading of the Law and the Prophets, the leaders sent someone over to tell Paul and Barnabas, &amp;apos;Friends, if you have anything to say that will help the people, please say it.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Paul got up. He motioned with his hand and said:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">The God of Israel chose our ancestors, and he let our people prosper while they were living in Egypt. Then with his mighty power he led them out,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">and for about 40 years he took care of them in the desert.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">He destroyed seven nations in the land of Canaan and gave their land to our people.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">All this happened in about 450 years.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">but the people demanded a king. So for 40 years God gave them King Saul, the son of Kish from the tribe of Benjamin.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Later, God removed Saul and let David rule in his place. God said about him, &amp;apos;David the son of Jesse is the kind of person who pleases me most! He does everything I want him to do.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">God promised that someone from David's family would come to save the people of Israel, and this one is Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">But before Jesus came, John was telling everyone in Israel to turn back to God and be baptized.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">Then, when John's work was almost done, he said, &amp;apos;Who do you people think I am? Do you think I am the Promised One? He will come later, and I am not good enough to untie his sandals.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">Now listen, you descendants of Abraham! Pay attention, all of you Gentiles who are here to worship God! Listen to this message about how to be saved, because it is for everyone.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">The people of Jerusalem and their leaders didn't realize who Jesus was. And they didn't understand the words of the prophets they read each Sabbath. So they condemned Jesus just as the prophets had said.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">But God raised him from death!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">Then for many days Jesus appeared to his followers who had gone with him from Galilee to Jerusalem. Now they are telling our people about him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">God made a promise to our ancestors. And we are here to tell you the good news</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">that he has kept this promise to us. It is just as the second Psalm says about Jesus,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">God raised Jesus from death and will never let his body decay. It is just as God said,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">And in another psalm it says, &amp;apos;God will never let the body of his Holy One decay.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">When David was alive, he obeyed God. Then after he died, he was buried in the family grave, and his body decayed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">But God raised Jesus from death, and his body did not decay.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">My friends, the message is that Jesus can forgive your sins! The Law of Moses could not set you free from all your sins.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">But everyone who has faith in Jesus is set free.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">Make sure what the prophets have said doesn't happen to you. They said,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">&amp;apos;Look, you people</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">As Paul and Barnabas were leaving the synagogue, the people begged them to say more about these same things on the next Sabbath.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43">After the service, many Jews and a lot of Gentiles who worshiped God went with them. Paul and Barnabas begged them all to remain faithful to God, who had treated them with undeserved grace.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44">The next Sabbath almost everyone in town came to hear the message about the Lord.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45">When the Jewish people saw the crowds, they were very jealous. They insulted Paul and spoke against everything he said.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46">But Paul and Barnabas bravely said:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="47">The Lord has given us this command,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="48">This message made the Gentiles glad, and they praised what they had heard about the Lord. Everyone who had been chosen for eternal life then put their faith in the Lord.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="49">The message about the Lord spread all over this region.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="50">But the Jewish leaders went to some of the important men in the town and to some respected women who were religious. They turned them against Paul and Barnabas and started making trouble for them. They even chased them out of this part of the country.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="51">Paul and Barnabas shook the dust from that place off their feet and went on to the city of Iconium.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="52">But the Lord's followers in Antioch were very happy and were filled with the Holy Spirit.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="14">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Paul and Barnabas spoke in the synagogue in Iconium, just as they had done at Antioch, and many Jews and Gentiles put their faith in the Lord.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">But the Jews who did not have faith in him made the other Gentiles angry and turned them against the Lord's followers.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Paul and Barnabas stayed there for a while, having faith in the Lord and bravely speaking his message. The Lord gave them the power to work miracles and wonders, and he showed that their message about his gift of undeserved grace was true.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">The people of Iconium did not know what to think. Some of them believed the Jewish group, and others believed the apostles.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Finally, some Gentiles and Jews, together with their leaders, decided to make trouble for Paul and Barnabas and to stone them to death.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">In Lystra there was a man who had been born with paralyzed feet and had never been able to walk.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">The man was listening to Paul speak, when Paul saw that he had faith in Jesus and could be healed. So he looked straight at the man</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">and shouted, &amp;apos;Stand up!&amp;apos; The man jumped up and started walking around.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">When the crowd saw what Paul had done, they yelled out in the language of Lycaonia, &amp;apos;The gods have turned into humans and have come down to us!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">The people then gave Barnabas the name Zeus, and they gave Paul the name Hermes, because he did the talking.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">The temple of Zeus was near the entrance to the city. Its priest and the crowds wanted to offer a sacrifice to Barnabas and Paul. So the priest brought some bulls and flowers to the city gates.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">When the two apostles found out about this, they tore their clothes in horror and ran to the crowd, shouting:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Why are you doing this? We are humans just like you. Please give up all this foolishness. Turn to the living God, who made the sky, the earth, the sea, and everything in them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">In times past, God let each nation go its own way.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">But he showed he was there by the good things he did. God sends rain from heaven and makes your crops grow. He gives food to you and makes your hearts glad.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Even after Paul and Barnabas had said all this, they could hardly keep the people from offering a sacrifice to them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Some Jewish leaders from Antioch and Iconium came and turned the crowds against Paul. They hit him with stones and dragged him out of the city, thinking he was dead.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">But when the Lord's followers gathered around Paul, he stood up and went back into the city. The next day he and Barnabas went to Derbe.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Paul and Barnabas preached the good news in Derbe and won some people to the Lord. Then they went back to Lystra, Iconium, and Antioch in Pisidia.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">They encouraged the followers and begged them to remain faithful. They told them, &amp;apos;We have to suffer a lot before we can get into God's kingdom.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">Paul and Barnabas chose some leaders for each of the churches. Then they went without eating and prayed that the Lord would take good care of these leaders who had trusted in the Lord.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">Paul and Barnabas went on through Pisidia to Pamphylia,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">where they preached in the town of Perga. Then they went down to Attalia</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">and sailed to Antioch in Syria. It was there that they had been placed in God's care for the work they had now completed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">After arriving in Antioch, they called the church together. They told the people what God had helped them do and how he had made it possible for the Gentiles to believe.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">Then they stayed there with the followers for a long time.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="15">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Some people came from Judea and started teaching the Lord's followers that they could not be saved, unless they were circumcised as Moses had taught.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">This caused trouble, and Paul and Barnabas argued with them about this teaching. So it was decided to send Paul and Barnabas and a few others to Jerusalem to discuss this problem with the apostles and the church leaders. My friends, you know that God decided long ago to let me be the one from your group to preach the good news to the Gentiles. God did this so they would hear and obey him. My friends, listen to me! and rebuild David's fallen house. I will build it from its ruins and set it up again. will turn to me and be my chosen ones. I, the Lord, say this. We apostles and leaders send friendly greetings to all of you Gentiles who are followers of the Lord in Antioch, Syria, and Cilicia. We send our best wishes.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">The men who were sent by the church went through Phoenicia and Samaria, telling how the Gentiles had turned to God. This news made the Lord's followers very happy.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">When the men arrived in Jerusalem, they were welcomed by the church, including the apostles and the leaders. They told them everything God had helped them do.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">But some Pharisees had become followers of the Lord. They stood up and said, &amp;apos;Gentiles who have faith in the Lord must be circumcised and told to obey the Law of Moses.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">The apostles and church leaders met to discuss this problem about Gentiles.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">They had talked it over for a long time, when Peter got up and said:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">He knows what is in everyone's heart. And he showed he had chosen the Gentiles, when he gave them the Holy Spirit, just as he had given his Spirit to us.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">God treated them in the same way that he treated us. They put their faith in him, and he made their hearts pure.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Now why are you trying to make God angry by placing a heavy burden on these followers? This burden was too heavy for us or our ancestors.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">But we believe that we will be saved by the gift of undeserved grace from our Lord Jesus Christ, just as the Gentiles are.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Everyone kept quiet and listened as Barnabas and Paul told how God had given them the power to work a lot of miracles and wonders for the Gentiles.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">After they had finished speaking, James said:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Simon Peter has told how God first came to the Gentiles and made some of them his own people.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">This agrees with what the prophets wrote,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">&amp;apos;I, the Lord, will return</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Then other nations</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">I promised it long ago.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">And so, my friends, I don't think we should place burdens on the Gentiles who are turning to God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">We should simply write and tell them not to eat anything that has been offered to idols. They should be told not to eat the meat of any animal that has been strangled or that still has blood in it. They must also not commit any terrible sexual sins.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">We must remember that the Law of Moses has been preached in city after city for many years, and every Sabbath it is read in our synagogues.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">The apostles, the leaders, and all the church members decided to send some men to Antioch along with Paul and Barnabas. They chose Silas and Judas Barsabbas, who were two leaders of the Lord's followers.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">They wrote a letter that said:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">We have heard that some people from here have terribly upset you by what they said. But we did not send them!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">So we met together and decided to choose some men and to send them to you along with our good friends Barnabas and Paul.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">These men have risked their lives for our Lord Jesus Christ.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">We are also sending Judas and Silas, who will tell you in person the same things that we are writing.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">The Holy Spirit has shown us that we should not place any extra burden on you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">But you should not eat anything offered to idols. You should not eat any meat that still has the blood in it or any meat of any animal that has been strangled. You must also not commit any terrible sexual sins. If you follow these instructions, you will do well.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">The four men left Jerusalem and went to Antioch. Then they called the church members together and gave them the letter.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">When the letter was read, everyone was pleased and greatly encouraged.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">Judas and Silas were prophets, and they spoke a long time, encouraging and helping the Lord's followers.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">The men from Jerusalem stayed on in Antioch for a while. And when they left to return to the ones who had sent them, the followers wished them well.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">Sometime later Paul said to Barnabas, &amp;apos;Let's go back and visit the Lord's followers in the cities where we preached his message. Then we will know how they are doing.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">Barnabas wanted to take along John, whose other name was Mark.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">But Paul did not want to, because Mark had left them in Pamphylia and had stopped working with them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">Paul and Barnabas argued, then each of them went his own way. Barnabas took Mark and sailed to Cyprus,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">but Paul took Silas and left after the followers had placed them in God's care.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">They traveled through Syria and Cilicia, encouraging the churches.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="16">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Paul and Silas went back to Derbe and Lystra, where there was a follower named Timothy. His mother was also a follower. She was Jewish, and his father was Greek.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">The Lord's followers in Lystra and Iconium said good things about Timothy,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">and Paul wanted him to go with them. But Paul first had him circumcised, because all the Jewish people around there knew that Timothy's father was Greek. We spent several days in Philippi.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">As Paul and the others went from city to city, they told the followers what the apostles and leaders in Jerusalem had decided, and they urged them to follow these instructions.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">The churches became stronger in their faith, and each day more people put their faith in the Lord.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Paul and his friends went through Phrygia and Galatia, but the Holy Spirit would not let them preach in Asia.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">After they arrived in Mysia, they tried to go into Bithynia, but the Spirit of Jesus would not let them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">So they went on through Mysia until they came to Troas.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">During the night, Paul had a vision of someone from Macedonia who was standing there and begging him, &amp;apos;Come over to Macedonia and help us!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">After Paul had seen the vision, we began looking for a way to go to Macedonia. We were sure that God had called us to preach the good news there.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">We sailed straight from Troas to Samothrace, and the next day we arrived in Neapolis.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">From there we went to Philippi, which is a Roman colony in the first district of Macedonia.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Then on the Sabbath we went outside the city gate to a place by the river, where we thought there would be a Jewish meeting place for prayer. We sat down and talked with the women who came.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">One of them was Lydia, who was from the city of Thyatira and sold expensive purple cloth. She was a worshiper of the Lord God, and he made her willing to accept what Paul was saying.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Then after she and her family were baptized, she kept on begging us, &amp;apos;If you think I really do have faith in the Lord, come stay in my home.&amp;apos; Finally, we accepted her invitation.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">One day on our way to the place of prayer, we were met by a slave girl. She had a spirit in her that gave her the power to tell the future. By doing this she made a lot of money for her owners.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">The girl followed Paul and the rest of us, and she kept yelling, &amp;apos;These men are servants of the Most High God! They are telling you how to be saved.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">This went on for several days. Finally, Paul got so upset that he turned and said to the spirit, &amp;apos;In the name of Jesus Christ, I order you to leave this girl alone!&amp;apos; At once the evil spirit left her.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">When the girl's owners realized they had lost all chances for making more money, they grabbed Paul and Silas and dragged them into court.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">They told the officials, &amp;apos;These Jews are upsetting our city!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">They are telling us to do things we Romans are not allowed to do.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">The crowd joined in the attack on Paul and Silas. Then the officials tore the clothes off the two men and ordered them to be beaten with a whip.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">After they had been badly beaten, they were put in jail, and the jailer was told to guard them carefully.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">The jailer did as he was told. He put them deep inside the jail and chained their feet to heavy blocks of wood.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">About midnight Paul and Silas were praying and singing praises to God, while the other prisoners listened.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">Suddenly a strong earthquake shook the jail to its foundations. The doors opened, and the chains fell from all the prisoners.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">When the jailer woke up and saw that the doors were open, he thought that the prisoners had escaped. He pulled out his sword and was about to kill himself.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">But Paul shouted, &amp;apos;Don't harm yourself! No one has escaped.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">The jailer asked for a torch and went into the jail. He was shaking all over as he knelt down in front of Paul and Silas.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">After he had led them out of the jail, he asked, &amp;apos;What must I do to be saved?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">They replied, &amp;apos;Have faith in the Lord Jesus and you will be saved! This is also true for everyone who lives in your home.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">Then Paul and Silas told him and everyone else in his house about the Lord.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">While it was still night, the jailer took them to a place where he could wash their cuts and bruises. Then he and everyone in his home were baptized.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">They were very glad they had put their faith in God. After this, the jailer took Paul and Silas to his home and gave them something to eat.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">The next morning the officials sent some police with orders for the jailer to let Paul and Silas go.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">The jailer told Paul, &amp;apos;The officials have ordered me to set you free. Now you can leave in peace.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">But Paul told the police, &amp;apos;We are Roman citizens, and the Roman officials had us beaten in public without giving us a trial. They threw us into jail. Now do they think they can secretly send us away? No, they cannot! They will have to come here themselves and let us out.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">When the police told the officials that Paul and Silas were Roman citizens, the officials were afraid.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">So they came and apologized. They led them out of the jail and asked them to please leave town.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">But Paul and Silas went straight to the home of Lydia, where they saw the Lord's followers and encouraged them. Then they left.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="17">
			<VERS vnumber="1">After Paul and his friends had traveled through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they went on to Thessalonica. A synagogue was in that city.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">So as usual, Paul went there to worship, and on three Sabbaths he spoke to the people. He used the Scriptures</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">to show them that the Messiah had to suffer, but that he would rise from death. Paul also told them that Jesus is the Messiah he was preaching about.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Some of them believed what Paul had said, and they became followers with Paul and Silas. Some Gentiles and many important women also believed the message. People were asking, &amp;apos;What is this know-it-all trying to say?&amp;apos; People of Athens, I see that you are very religious.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">The Jewish leaders were jealous and got some troublemakers who hung around the marketplace to start a riot in the city. They wanted to drag Paul and Silas out to the mob, and so they went straight to Jason's home.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">But when they did not find them there, they dragged out Jason and some of the Lord's followers. They took them to the city authorities and shouted, &amp;apos;Paul and Silas have been upsetting things everywhere. Now they have come here,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">and Jason has welcomed them into his home. All of them break the laws of the Roman Emperor by claiming that someone named Jesus is king.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">The officials and the people were upset when they heard this.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">So they made Jason and the other followers pay bail before letting them go.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">That same night the Lord's followers sent Paul and Silas on to Berea, and after they arrived, they went to the synagogue.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">The people in Berea were much nicer than those in Thessalonica, and they gladly accepted the message. Day after day they studied the Scriptures to see if these things were true.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Many of them put their faith in the Lord, including some important Greek women and several men.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">When the Jewish leaders in Thessalonica heard that Paul had been preaching God's message in Berea, they went there and caused trouble by turning the crowds against Paul.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">At once the followers sent Paul down to the coast, but Silas and Timothy stayed in Berea.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Some men went with Paul as far as Athens, and then returned with instructions for Silas and Timothy to join him as soon as possible.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">While Paul was waiting in Athens, he was upset to see all the idols in the city.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">He went to the synagogue to speak to the Jews and to anyone who worshiped with them. Day after day he also spoke to everyone he met in the market.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Some of them were Epicureans and some were Stoics, and they started arguing with him. Some even said, &amp;apos;Paul must be preaching about foreign gods! That's what he means when he talks about Jesus and about people rising from death.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">They brought Paul before a council called the Areopagus, and said, &amp;apos;Tell us what your new teaching is all about.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">We have heard you say some strange things, and we want to know what you mean.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">More than anything else the people of Athens and the foreigners living there loved to hear and to talk about anything new.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">So Paul stood up in front of the council and said:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">As I was going through your city and looking at the things you worship, I found an altar with the words, &amp;apos;To an Unknown God.&amp;apos; You worship this God, but you don't really know him. So I want to tell you about him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">This God made the world and everything in it. He is Lord of heaven and earth, and he doesn't live in temples built by human hands.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">He doesn't need help from anyone. He gives life, breath, and everything else to all people.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">From one person God made all nations who live on earth, and he decided when and where every nation would be.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">God has done all this, so that we will look for him and reach out and find him. He isn't far from any of us,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">and he gives us the power to live, to move, and to be who we are. &amp;apos;We are his children,&amp;apos; just as some of your poets have said.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">Since we are God's children, we must not think that he is like an idol made out of gold or silver or stone. He isn't like anything that humans have thought up and made.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">In the past, God forgave all this because people did not know what they were doing. But now he says that everyone everywhere must turn to him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">He has set a day when he will judge the world's people with fairness. And he has chosen the man Jesus to do the judging for him. God has given proof of this to all of us by raising Jesus from death.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">As soon as the people heard Paul say a man had been raised from death, some of them started laughing. Others said, &amp;apos;We will hear you talk about this some other time.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">When Paul left the council meeting,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">some of the men put their faith in the Lord and went with Paul. One of them was a council member named Dionysius. A woman named Damaris and several others also put their faith in the Lord.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="18">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Paul left Athens and went to Corinth,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">where he met Aquila, a Jewish man from Pontus. Not long before this, Aquila had come from Italy with his wife Priscilla, because Emperor Claudius had ordered the Jewish people to leave Rome. Paul went to see Aquila and Priscilla</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">and found out they were tent makers. Paul was also a tent maker, so he stayed with them, and they worked together.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Every Sabbath, Paul went to the synagogue. He spoke to Jews and Gentiles and tried to win them over.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">But after Silas and Timothy came from Macedonia, he spent all his time preaching to the Jews about Jesus the Messiah.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Finally, they turned against him and insulted him. So he shook the dust from his clothes and told them, &amp;apos;Whatever happens to you will be your own fault! I am not to blame. From now on I am going to preach to the Gentiles.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Paul then moved into the house of a man named Titius Justus, who worshiped God and lived next door to the synagogue.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Crispus was the leader of the synagogue. He and everyone in his family put their faith in the Lord. Many others in Corinth also heard the message, and all the people who had faith in the Lord were baptized.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">One night, Paul had a vision, and in it the Lord said, &amp;apos;Don't be afraid to keep on preaching. Don't stop!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">I am with you, and you won't be harmed. Many people in this city belong to me.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Paul stayed on in Corinth for a year and a half, teaching God's message to the people.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">While Gallio was governor of Achaia, some of the Jewish leaders got together and grabbed Paul. They brought him into court</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">and said, &amp;apos;This man is trying to make our people worship God in a way that is against our Law!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Even before Paul could speak, Gallio said, &amp;apos;If you were charging this man with a crime or some other wrong, I would have to listen to you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">But since this concerns only words, names, and your own law, you will have to take care of it yourselves. I refuse to judge such matters.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Then he sent them out of the court.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">The crowd grabbed Sosthenes, the Jewish leader, and beat him up in front of the court. But none of this mattered to Gallio.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">After Paul had stayed for a while with the Lord's followers in Corinth, he told them goodbye and sailed on to Syria with Aquila and Priscilla. But before he left, he had his head shaved at Cenchreae because he had made a promise to God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">The three of them arrived in Ephesus, where Paul left Priscilla and Aquila. He then went into the synagogue to talk with the people there.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">They asked him to stay longer, but he refused.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">He told them goodbye and said, &amp;apos;If God lets me, I will come back.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Paul sailed to Caesarea, where he greeted the church. Then he went on to Antioch.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">After staying there for a while, he left and visited several places in Galatia and Phrygia. He helped the followers there to become stronger in their faith.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">A Jewish man named Apollos came to Ephesus. Apollos had been born in the city of Alexandria. He was a very good speaker and knew a lot about the Scriptures.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">He also knew much about the Lord's Way, and he spoke about it with great excitement. What he taught about Jesus was right, but all he knew was John's message about baptism.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">Apollos started speaking bravely in the synagogue. But when Priscilla and Aquila heard him, they took him to their home and helped him understand God's Way even better.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">Apollos decided to travel through Achaia. So the Lord's followers wrote letters, encouraging the followers there to welcome him. After Apollos arrived in Achaia, he was a great help to everyone who had put their faith in the Lord Jesus because of God's gift of undeserved grace.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">He got into fierce arguments with the Jewish people, and in public he used the Scriptures to prove that Jesus is the Messiah.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="19">
			<VERS vnumber="1">While Apollos was in Corinth, Paul traveled across the hill country to Ephesus, where he met some of the Lord's followers.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">He asked them, &amp;apos;When you put your faith in Jesus, were you given the Holy Spirit?&amp;apos; &amp;apos;No!&amp;apos; they answered. &amp;apos;We have never even heard of the Holy Spirit.&amp;apos; Friends, you know we make a good living at this. People of Ephesus, who in the world doesn't know that our city is the center for worshiping the great goddess Artemis? Who doesn't know that her image which fell from heaven is right here?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">&amp;apos;Then why were you baptized?&amp;apos; Paul asked. They answered, &amp;apos;Because of what John taught.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Paul replied, &amp;apos;John baptized people so they would turn to God. But he also told them someone else was coming, and they should put their faith in him. Jesus is the one that John was talking about.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">After the people heard Paul say this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Then Paul placed his hands on them. The Holy Spirit was given to them, and they spoke unknown languages and prophesied.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">There were about twelve men in this group.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">For three months Paul went to the synagogue and talked bravely with the people about God's kingdom. He tried to win them over,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">but some of them were stubborn and refused to believe. In front of everyone they said terrible things about God's Way. Paul left and took the followers with him to the lecture hall of Tyrannus. He spoke there every day</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">for two years, until every Jew and Gentile in Asia had heard the Lord's message.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">God gave Paul the power to work great miracles.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">People even took handkerchiefs and aprons that had touched Paul's body, and they carried them to everyone who was sick. All of the sick people were healed, and the evil spirits went out.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Some Jewish men started going around trying to force out evil spirits by using the name of the Lord Jesus. They said to the spirits, &amp;apos;Come out in the name of that same Jesus that Paul preaches about!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Seven sons of a high priest named Sceva were doing this,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">when an evil spirit said to them, &amp;apos;I know Jesus! And I have heard about Paul. But who are you?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Then the man with the evil spirit jumped on them and beat them up. They ran out of the house, naked and bruised.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">When the Jews and Gentiles in Ephesus heard about this, they were so frightened that they praised the name of the Lord Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Many who were followers now started telling everyone about the evil things they had been doing.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Some who had been practicing witchcraft even brought their books and burned them in public. These books were worth about 50,000 silver coins.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">So the Lord's message spread and became even more powerful.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">After all this had happened, Paul decided to visit Macedonia and Achaia on his way to Jerusalem. Paul had said, &amp;apos;From there I will go on to Rome.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">So he sent his two helpers, Timothy and Erastus, to Macedonia. But he stayed on in Asia for a while.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">At that time there was serious trouble because of the Lord's Way.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">A silversmith named Demetrius had a business that made silver models of the temple of the goddess Artemis. Those who worked for him earned a lot of money.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">Demetrius brought together everyone who was in the same business and said:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">But you have surely seen and heard how this man Paul is upsetting a lot of people, not only in Ephesus, but almost everywhere in Asia. He claims that the gods we humans make are not really gods at all.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">Everyone will start saying terrible things about our business. They will stop respecting the temple of the goddess Artemis, who is worshiped in Asia and all over the world. Our great goddess will be forgotten!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">When the workers heard this, they got angry and started shouting, &amp;apos;Great is Artemis, the goddess of the Ephesians!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">Soon the whole city was in a riot, and some men grabbed Gaius and Aristarchus, who had come from Macedonia with Paul. Then everyone in the crowd rushed to the place where the town meetings were held.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">Paul wanted to go out and speak to the people, but the Lord's followers would not let him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">A few of the local officials were friendly to Paul, and they sent someone to warn him not to go.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">Some of the people in the meeting were shouting one thing, and others were shouting something else. Everyone was completely confused, and most of them did not even know why they were there.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">Several of the Jewish leaders pushed a man named Alexander to the front of the crowd and started telling him what to say. He motioned with his hand and tried to explain what was going on.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">But when the crowd saw that he was Jewish, they all shouted for two hours, &amp;apos;Great is Artemis, the goddess of the Ephesians!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">Finally, a town official made the crowd be quiet. Then he said:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">No one can deny this, and so you should calm down and not do anything foolish.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">You have brought men in here who have not robbed temples or spoken against our goddess.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">If Demetrius and his workers have a case against these men, we have courts and judges. Let them take their complaints there.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">But if you want to do more than that, the matter will have to be brought before the city council.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">We could easily be accused of starting a riot today. There is no excuse for it! We cannot even give a reason for this uproar.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">After saying this, he told the people to leave.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="20">
			<VERS vnumber="1">When the riot was over, Paul sent for the followers and encouraged them. He then told them goodbye and left for Macedonia.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">As he traveled from place to place, he encouraged the followers with many messages. Finally, he went to Greece</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">and stayed there for three months. Paul was about to sail to Syria. But some of the Jewish leaders plotted against him, so he decided to return by way of Macedonia. You know everything I did during the time I was with you when I first came to Asia. Then they went with him to the ship.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">With him were Sopater, son of Pyrrhus from Berea, and Aristarchus and Secundus from Thessalonica. Gaius from Derbe was also with him, and so were Timothy and the two Asians, Tychicus and Trophimus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">They went on ahead to Troas and waited for us there.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">After the Festival of Thin Bread, we sailed from Philippi. Five days later we met them in Troas and stayed there for a week.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">On the first day of the week we met to break bread together. Paul spoke to the people until midnight because he was leaving the next morning.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">In the upstairs room where we were meeting, there were a lot of lamps.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">A young man by the name of Eutychus was sitting on a window sill. While Paul was speaking, the young man got very sleepy. Finally, he went to sleep and fell three floors all the way down to the ground. When they picked him up, he was dead.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Paul went down and bent over Eutychus. He took him in his arms and said, &amp;apos;Don't worry! He's alive.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">After Paul had gone back upstairs, he broke bread, and ate with us. He then spoke until dawn and left.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Then the followers took the young man home alive and were very happy.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Paul decided to travel by land to Assos. The rest of us went on ahead by ship, and we were to take him aboard there.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">When he met us in Assos, he came aboard, and we sailed on to Mitylene.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">The next day we came to a place near Chios, and the following day we reached Samos. The day after that we sailed to Miletus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Paul had decided to sail on past Ephesus, because he did not want to spend too much time in Asia. He was in a hurry and wanted to be in Jerusalem in time for Pentecost.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">From Miletus, Paul sent a message for the church leaders at Ephesus to come and meet with him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">When they got there, he said:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Some of the Jews plotted against me and caused me a lot of sorrow and trouble. But I served the Lord and was humble.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">When I preached in public or taught in your homes, I didn't hold back from telling anything that would help you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">I told Jews and Gentiles to turn to God and have faith in our Lord Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">I don't know what will happen to me in Jerusalem, but I must obey God's Spirit and go there.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">In every city I visit, I am told by the Holy Spirit that I will be put in jail and will be in trouble in Jerusalem.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">But I don't care what happens to me, as long as I finish the work the Lord Jesus gave me to do. And this work is to tell the good news about God's gift of undeserved grace.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">I have gone from place to place, preaching to you about God's kingdom, but now I know that none of you will ever see me again.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">I tell you today I am no longer responsible for any of you!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">I have told you everything God wants you to know.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">Look after yourselves and everyone the Holy Spirit has placed in your care. Be like shepherds to God's church. It is the flock he bought with the blood of his own Son.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">I know that after I am gone, others will come like fierce wolves to attack you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">Some of your own people will tell lies to win over the Lord's followers.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">Be on your guard! Remember how day and night for three years I kept warning you with tears in my eyes.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">I now place you in God's care. Remember the message about his gift of undeserved grace! This message can help you and give you what belongs to you as God's people.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">I have never wanted anyone's money or clothes.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">You know how I have worked with my own hands to make a living for myself and my friends.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">By everything I did, I showed how you should work to help everyone who is weak. Remember that our Lord Jesus said, &amp;apos;More blessings come from giving than from receiving.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">After Paul had finished speaking, he knelt down with all of them and prayed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">Everyone cried and hugged and kissed him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">They were especially sad because Paul had told them, &amp;apos;You will never see me again.&amp;apos;</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="21">
			<VERS vnumber="1">After saying goodbye, we sailed straight to Cos. The next day we reached Rhodes and from there sailed on to Patara.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">We found a ship going to Phoenicia, so we got on board and sailed off. My friend, you can see how many tens of thousands of our people have become followers! And all of them are eager to obey the Law of Moses. As soon as the mob saw the commander and soldiers, they stopped beating Paul. &amp;apos;How do you know Greek?&amp;apos; the commander asked.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">We came within sight of Cyprus and then sailed south of it on to the port of Tyre in Syria, where the ship was going to unload its cargo.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">We found the Lord's followers and stayed with them for a week. The Holy Spirit had told them to warn Paul not to go on to Jerusalem.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">But when the week was over, we started on our way again. All the men, together with their wives and children, walked with us from the town to the seashore. We knelt on the beach and prayed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Then after saying goodbye to each other, we got into the ship, and they went back home.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">We sailed from Tyre to Ptolemais, where we greeted the followers and stayed with them for a day.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">The next day we went to Caesarea and stayed with Philip, the preacher. He was one of the seven men who helped the apostles,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">and he had four unmarried daughters who prophesied.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">We had been in Caesarea for several days, when the prophet Agabus came to us from Judea.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">He took Paul's belt, and with it he tied up his own hands and feet. Then he told us, &amp;apos;The Holy Spirit says that some of the Jewish leaders in Jerusalem will tie up the man who owns this belt. They will also hand him over to the Gentiles.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">After Agabus said this, we and the followers living there begged Paul not to go to Jerusalem.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">But Paul answered, &amp;apos;Why are you crying and breaking my heart? I am not only willing to be put in jail for the Lord Jesus, but I am even willing to die for him in Jerusalem!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Since we could not get Paul to change his mind, we gave up and prayed, &amp;apos;Lord, please make us willing to do what you want.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Then we got ready to go to Jerusalem.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Some of the followers from Caesarea went with us and took us to stay in the home of Mnason. He was from Cyprus and had been a follower from the beginning.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">When we arrived in Jerusalem, the Lord's followers gladly welcomed us.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Paul went with us to see James the next day, and all the church leaders were present.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Paul greeted them and told how God had used him to help the Gentiles.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Everyone who heard this praised God and said to Paul:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">But they have been told that you are teaching those who live among the Gentiles to disobey this Law. They claim that you are telling them not to circumcise their sons or to follow our customs.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">What should we do now that our people have heard you are here?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">Please do what we ask, because four of our men have made special promises to God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">Join with them and prepare yourself for the ceremony that goes with the promises. Pay the cost for their heads to be shaved. Then everyone will learn that the reports about you are not true. They will know you do obey the Law of Moses.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">Some while ago we told the Gentile followers what we think they should do. We instructed them not to eat anything offered to idols. They were told not to eat any meat with blood still in it or the meat of an animal that has been strangled. They were also told not to commit any terrible sexual sins.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">The next day Paul took the four men with him and got himself ready at the same time they did. Then he went into the temple and told when the final ceremony would take place and when an offering would be made for each of them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">When the period of seven days for the ceremony was almost over, some of the Jewish people from Asia saw Paul in the temple. They got a large crowd together and started attacking him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">They were shouting, &amp;apos;Friends, help us! This man goes around everywhere, saying bad things about our nation and about the Law of Moses and about this temple. He has even brought shame to this holy temple by bringing in Gentiles.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">Some of them thought that Paul had brought Trophimus from Ephesus into the temple, because they had seen them together in the city.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">The whole city was in an uproar, and the people turned into a mob. They grabbed Paul and dragged him out of the temple. Then suddenly the doors were shut.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">The people were about to kill Paul when the Roman army commander heard that all Jerusalem was starting to riot.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">So he quickly took some soldiers and officers and ran to where the crowd had gathered.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">The army commander went over and arrested him and had him bound with two chains. Then he tried to find out who Paul was and what he had done.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">Part of the crowd shouted one thing, and part of them shouted something else. But they were making so much noise that the commander could not find out a thing. Then he ordered Paul to be taken into the fortress.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">As they reached the steps, the crowd became so wild that the soldiers had to lift Paul up and carry him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">The crowd followed and kept shouting, &amp;apos;Kill him! Kill him!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">When Paul was about to be taken into the fortress, he asked the commander, &amp;apos;Can I say something to you?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">&amp;apos;Aren't you that Egyptian who started a riot not long ago and led 4,000 terrorists into the desert?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">&amp;apos;No!&amp;apos; Paul replied. &amp;apos;I am a Jew from Tarsus, an important city in Cilicia. Please let me speak to the crowd.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">The commander told him he could speak, so Paul stood on the steps and motioned to the people. When they were quiet, he spoke to them in Aramaic:</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="22">
			<VERS vnumber="1">&amp;apos;My friends and leaders of our nation, listen as I explain what happened!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">When the crowd heard Paul speak to them in Aramaic, they became even quieter. Then Paul said: The Lord replied, &amp;apos;I am Jesus from Nazareth! I am the one you are so cruel to.&amp;apos; Then he told me, &amp;apos;Get up and go to Damascus. When you get there, you will be told what to do.&amp;apos; At once I could see. &amp;apos;Yes,&amp;apos; Paul answered. But Paul replied, &amp;apos;I was born a Roman citizen.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">I am a Jew, born in the city of Tarsus in Cilicia. But I grew up here in Jerusalem where I was a student of Gamaliel and was taught to follow every single law of our ancestors. In fact, I was just as eager to obey God as any of you are today.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">I made trouble for everyone who followed the Lord's Way, and I even had some of them killed. I had others arrested and put in jail. I didn't care if they were men or women.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">The high priest and all the council members can tell you this is true. They even gave me letters to the Jewish leaders in Damascus, so that I could arrest people there and bring them to Jerusalem to be punished.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">One day about noon I was getting close to Damascus, when a bright light from heaven suddenly flashed around me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">I fell to the ground and heard a voice asking, &amp;apos;Saul, Saul, why are you so cruel to me?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">&amp;apos;Who are you?&amp;apos; I answered.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Those who were traveling with me saw the light, but did not hear the voice.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">I asked, &amp;apos;Lord, what do you want me to do?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">The light had been so bright that I couldn't see. And the others had to lead me by the hand to Damascus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">In that city there was a man named Ananias, who faithfully obeyed the Law of Moses and was well liked by all the Jewish people living there.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">He came to me and said, &amp;apos;Saul, my friend, you can now see again!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Then Ananias told me, &amp;apos;The God that our ancestors worshiped has chosen you to know what he wants done. He has chosen you to see the One Who Obeys God and to hear his voice.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">You must tell everyone what you have seen and heard.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">What are you waiting for? Get up! Be baptized, and wash away your sins by praying to the Lord.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">After this I returned to Jerusalem and went to the temple to pray. There I had a vision</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">of the Lord who said to me, &amp;apos;Hurry and leave Jerusalem! The people won't listen to what you say about me.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">I replied, &amp;apos;Lord, they know that in many of our synagogues I arrested and beat people who had faith in you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Stephen was killed because he spoke for you, and I stood there and cheered them on. I even guarded the clothes of the men who murdered him.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">But the Lord told me to go, and he promised to send me far away to the Gentiles.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">The crowd listened until Paul said this. Then they started shouting, &amp;apos;Get rid of this man! He doesn't deserve to live.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">They kept shouting. They waved their clothes around and threw dust into the air.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">The Roman commander ordered Paul to be taken into the fortress and beaten with a whip. He did this to find out why the people were screaming at Paul.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">While the soldiers were tying Paul up to be beaten, he asked the officer standing there, &amp;apos;Is it legal to beat a Roman citizen before he has been tried in court?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">When the officer heard this, he went to the commander and said, &amp;apos;What are you doing? This man is a Roman citizen!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">The commander went to Paul and asked, &amp;apos;Tell me, are you a Roman citizen?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">The commander then said, &amp;apos;I paid a lot of money to become a Roman citizen.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">The men who were about to beat and question Paul quickly backed off. And the commander himself was frightened when he realized that he had put a Roman citizen in chains.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">The next day the commander wanted to know the real reason why the Jewish leaders had brought charges against Paul. So he had Paul's chains removed, and he ordered the chief priests and the whole council to meet. Then he had Paul led in and made him stand in front of them.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="23">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Paul looked straight at the council members and said, &amp;apos;My friends, to this day I have served God with a clear conscience!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Then Ananias the high priest ordered the men standing beside Paul to hit him on the mouth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Paul turned to the high priest and said, &amp;apos;You whitewashed wall! God will hit you. You sit there to judge me by the Law of Moses. But at the same time you order men to break the Law by hitting me.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">The men standing beside Paul asked, &amp;apos;Don't you know you are insulting God's high priest?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Paul replied, &amp;apos;Oh! I didn't know he was the high priest. The Scriptures do tell us not to speak evil about a leader of our people.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">When Paul saw that some of the council members were Sadducees and others were Pharisees, he shouted, &amp;apos;My friends, I am a Pharisee and the son of a Pharisee. I am on trial simply because I believe that the dead will be raised to life.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">As soon as Paul said this, the Pharisees and the Sadducees got into a big argument, and the council members started taking sides.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">The Sadducees do not believe in angels or spirits or that the dead will rise to life. But the Pharisees believe in all of these,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">and so there was a lot of shouting. Some of the teachers of the Law of Moses were Pharisees. Finally, they became angry and said, &amp;apos;We don't find anything wrong with this man. Maybe a spirit or an angel really did speak to him.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">The argument became fierce, and the commander was afraid that Paul would be pulled apart. So he ordered the soldiers to go in and rescue Paul. Then they took him back into the fortress.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">That night the Lord stood beside Paul and said, &amp;apos;Don't worry! Just as you have told others about me in Jerusalem, you must also tell about me in Rome.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Then some of them went to the chief priests and the nation's leaders and said, &amp;apos;We have promised God that we would not eat a thing until we have killed Paul.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">You and everyone in the council must go to the commander and pretend that you want to find out more about the charges against Paul. Ask for him to be brought before your court. Meanwhile, we will be waiting to kill him before he gets there.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">When Paul's nephew heard about the plot, he went to the fortress and told Paul about it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">So Paul said to one of the army officers, &amp;apos;Take this young man to the commander. He has something to tell him.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">The officer took him to the commander and said, &amp;apos;The prisoner named Paul asked me to bring this young man to you, because he has something to tell you.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">The commander took the young man aside and asked him in private, &amp;apos;What do you want to tell me?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">He answered, &amp;apos;Some men are planning to ask you to bring Paul down to the Jewish council tomorrow. They will claim they want to find out more about him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">But please don't do what they say. More than 40 men are going to attack Paul. They have made a vow not to eat or drink anything until they have killed him. Even now they are waiting to hear what you decide.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">The commander sent the young man away after saying to him, &amp;apos;Don't let anyone know you told me this.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">The commander called in two of his officers and told them, &amp;apos;By nine o'clock tonight have 200 soldiers ready to go to Caesarea. Take along 70 men on horseback and 200 foot soldiers with spears.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">Get a horse ready for Paul and make sure he gets safely through to Felix the governor.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">The commander wrote a letter that said:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">Greetings from Claudius Lysias to the Honorable Governor Felix:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">Some Jews grabbed this man and were about to kill him. But when I found out that he was a Roman citizen, I took some soldiers and rescued him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">I wanted to find out what they had against him. So I brought him before their council</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">and learned that the charges concern only their religious laws. This man isn't guilty of anything for which he should die or even be put in jail.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">As soon as I learned that there was a plot against him, I sent him to you and told their leaders to bring charges against him in your court.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">The soldiers obeyed the commander's orders, and that same night they took Paul to the city of Antipatris.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">The next day the foot soldiers returned to the fortress and let the soldiers on horseback take him the rest of the way.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">When they came to Caesarea, they gave the letter to the governor and handed Paul over to him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">The governor read the letter. Then he asked Paul and found out that he was from Cilicia.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">The governor said, &amp;apos;I will listen to your case as soon as the people come to bring their charges against you.&amp;apos; After saying this, he gave orders for Paul to be kept as a prisoner in Herod's palace.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="24">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Five days later Ananias the high priest, together with some of their leaders and a lawyer named Tertullus, went to the governor to present their case against Paul.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">So Paul was called in, and Tertullus stated the case against him: Honorable Felix, you have brought our people a long period of peace, and because of your concern our nation is much better off. I know that you have judged the people of our nation for many years, and I am glad to defend myself in your court.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">All of us are always grateful for what you have done.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">I don't want to bother you, but please be patient with us and listen to me for just a few minutes.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">This man has been found to be a real pest and troublemaker for our people all over the world. He is also a leader of a group called Nazarenes.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">The Jewish crowd spoke up and agreed with what Tertullus had said.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">The governor motioned for Paul to speak, and he began:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">It was no more than twelve days ago that I went to worship in Jerusalem. You can find this out easily enough.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Never once did the Jews find me arguing with anyone in the temple. I didn't cause trouble in the synagogues or in the city itself.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">There is no way that they can prove these charges they are now bringing against me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">I admit that their leaders think the Lord's Way which I follow is based on wrong beliefs. But I still worship the same God that my ancestors worshiped. And I believe everything written in the Law of Moses and in the Prophets.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">I am just as sure as these people are that God will raise from death everyone, good or evil.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">And because I am sure, I try my best to have a clear conscience in whatever I do for God or for people.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">After being away for several years, I returned here to bring gifts for the poor people of my nation and to offer sacrifices.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">This is what I was doing when I was found going through a ceremony in the temple. I wasn't with a crowd, and there was no uproar.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Some Jews from Asia were there at that time, and if they have anything to say against me, they should be here now.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Or ask the ones who are here. They can tell you that they didn't find me guilty of anything when I was tried by their own council.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">The only charge they can bring against me is what I shouted out in court, when I said, &amp;apos;I am on trial today because I believe that the dead will be raised to life!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Felix knew a lot about the Lord's Way. But he brought the trial to an end and said, &amp;apos;I will make my decision after Lysias the commander arrives.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">He then ordered the army officer to keep Paul under guard, but not to lock him up or to stop his friends from helping him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">Several days later Felix and his wife Drusilla, who was Jewish, went to the place where Paul was kept under guard. They sent for Paul and listened while he spoke to them about having faith in Christ Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">But Felix was frightened when Paul started talking to them about doing right, about self-control, and about the coming judgment. So he said to Paul, &amp;apos;That's enough for now. You may go. But when I have time I will send for you.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">After this, Felix often sent for Paul and talked with him, because he hoped that Paul would offer him a bribe.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">Two years later Porcius Festus became governor in place of Felix. But since Felix wanted to do the Jewish leaders a favor, he kept Paul in jail.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="25">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Three days after Festus had become governor, he went from Caesarea to Jerusalem.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">There the chief priests and some Jewish leaders told him about their charges against Paul. They also asked Festus</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">if he would be willing to bring Paul to Jerusalem. They begged him to do this because they were planning to attack and kill Paul on the way.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">But Festus told them, &amp;apos;Paul will be kept in Caesarea, and I am soon going there myself.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">If he has done anything wrong, let your leaders go with me and bring charges against him there.&amp;apos; Felix left a man here in jail, Festus answered, &amp;apos;You can hear him tomorrow.&amp;apos; King Agrippa and other guests, look at this man! Every Jew from Jerusalem and Caesarea has come to me, demanding for him to be put to death.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Festus stayed in Jerusalem for eight or ten more days before going to Caesarea. Then the next day he took his place as judge and had Paul brought into court.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">As soon as Paul came in, the leaders from Jerusalem crowded around him and said he was guilty of many serious crimes. But they could not prove anything.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Then Paul spoke in his own defense, &amp;apos;I have not broken the Law of my people. And I have not done anything against either the temple or the Emperor.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Festus wanted to please the leaders. So he asked Paul, &amp;apos;Are you willing to go to Jerusalem and be tried by me on these charges?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Paul replied, &amp;apos;I am on trial in the Emperor's court, and that's where I should be tried. You know very well I have not done anything to harm the Jewish nation.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">If I had done something deserving death, I would not ask to escape the death penalty. But I am not guilty of any of these crimes, and no one has the right to hand me over to these people. I now ask to be tried by the Emperor himself.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">After Festus had talked this over with members of his council, he told Paul, &amp;apos;You have asked to be tried by the Emperor, and to the Emperor you will go!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">A few days later King Agrippa and Bernice came to Caesarea to visit Festus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">They had been there for several days, when Festus told the king about the charges against Paul. He said:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">and when I went to Jerusalem, the chief priests and the Jewish leaders came and asked me to find him guilty.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">I told them it isn't the Roman custom to hand a man over to people who are bringing charges against him. He must first have the chance to meet them face to face and to defend himself against their charges.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">So when they came here with me, I wasted no time. On the very next day I took my place on the judge's bench and ordered him to be brought in.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">But when the men stood up to make their charges against him, they did not accuse him of any of the crimes that I thought they would.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Instead, they argued with him about some of their beliefs and about a dead man named Jesus, who Paul said was alive.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Since I did not know how to find out the truth about all this, I asked Paul if he would be willing to go to Jerusalem and be put on trial there.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">But Paul asked to be kept in jail until the Emperor could decide his case. So I ordered him to be kept here until I could send him to the Emperor.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Then Agrippa said to Festus, &amp;apos;I would also like to hear what this man has to say.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">The next day Agrippa and Bernice made a big show as they came into the meeting room. High ranking army officers and leading citizens of the town were also there. Festus then ordered Paul to be brought in</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">and said:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">I have not found him guilty of any crime deserving death. But because he has asked to be judged by the Emperor, I have decided to send him to Rome.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">I have to write some facts about this man to the Emperor. So I have brought him before all of you, but especially before you, King Agrippa. After we have talked about his case, I will then have something to write.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">It makes no sense to send a prisoner to the Emperor without stating the charges against him.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="26">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Agrippa told Paul, &amp;apos;You may now speak for yourself.&amp;apos; Paul stretched out his hand and said: Then the Lord answered, &amp;apos;I am Jesus! I am the one you are so cruel to.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">King Agrippa, I am glad for this chance to defend myself before you today on all these charges my own people have brought against me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">You know a lot about our religious customs and the beliefs that divide us. So I ask you to listen patiently to me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Now I am on trial because I believe the promise God made to our people long ago.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Day and night our twelve tribes have earnestly served God, waiting for his promised blessings. King Agrippa, because of this hope, some of our leaders have brought charges against me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Why should any of you doubt that God raises the dead to life?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">I once thought that I should do everything I could to oppose Jesus from Nazareth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">I did this first in Jerusalem, and with the authority of the chief priests I put many of God's people in jail. I even voted for them to be killed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">I often had them punished in our synagogues, and I tried to make them give up their faith. In fact, I was so angry with them, that I went looking for them in foreign cities.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">King Agrippa, one day I was on my way to Damascus with the authority and permission of the chief priests.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">About noon I saw a light brighter than the sun. It flashed from heaven on me and on everyone traveling with me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">We all fell to the ground. Then I heard a voice say to me in Aramaic, &amp;apos;Saul, Saul, why are you so cruel to me? It's foolish to fight against me!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">&amp;apos;Who are you?&amp;apos; I asked.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Now stand up. I have appeared to you, because I have chosen you to be my servant. You are to tell others what you have learned about me and what I will show you later.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">The Lord also said, &amp;apos;I will protect you from the Jews and from the Gentiles that I am sending you to.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">I want you to open their eyes, so they will turn from darkness to light and from the power of Satan to God. Then their sins will be forgiven, and by faith in me they will become part of God's holy people.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">King Agrippa, I obeyed this vision from heaven.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">First I preached to the people in Damascus, and then I went to Jerusalem and all over Judea. Finally, I went to the Gentiles and said, &amp;apos;Stop sinning and turn to God! Then prove what you have done by the way you live.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">That is why some men grabbed me in the temple and tried to kill me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">But all this time God has helped me, and I have preached both to the rich and to the poor. I have told them only what the prophets and Moses said would happen.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">I told them how the Messiah would suffer and be the first to be raised from death, so he could bring light to his own people and to the Gentiles.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">Before Paul finished defending himself, Festus shouted, &amp;apos;Paul, you're crazy! Too much learning has driven you out of your mind.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">But Paul replied, &amp;apos;Honorable Festus, I am not crazy. What I am saying is true, and it makes sense.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">None of these things happened off in a corner somewhere. I am sure that King Agrippa knows what I am talking about. That's why I can speak so plainly to him.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">Then Paul said to Agrippa, &amp;apos;Do you believe what the prophets said? I know you do.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">Agrippa asked Paul, &amp;apos;In such a short time do you think you can talk me into being a Christian?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">Paul answered, &amp;apos;Whether it takes a short time or a long time, I wish you and everyone else who hears me today would become just like me! Except, of course, for these chains.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">Then King Agrippa, Governor Festus, Bernice, and everyone who was with them got up.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">But before they left, they said, &amp;apos;This man isn't guilty of anything. He doesn't deserve to die or to be put in jail.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">Agrippa told Festus, &amp;apos;Paul could have been set free, if he had not asked to be tried by the Roman Emperor.&amp;apos;</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="27">
			<VERS vnumber="1">When it was time for us to sail to Rome, Captain Julius from the Emperor's special troops was put in charge of Paul and the other prisoners.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">We went aboard a ship from Adramyttium that was about to sail to some ports along the coast of Asia. Aristarchus from Thessalonica in Macedonia sailed on the ship with us. You should have listened to me! If you had stayed on in Crete, you would not have had this damage and loss.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">The next day we came to shore at Sidon. Captain Julius was very kind to Paul. He even let him visit his friends, so they could give him whatever he needed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">When we left Sidon, the winds were blowing against us, and we sailed close to the island of Cyprus to be safe from the wind.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Then we sailed south of Cilicia and Pamphylia until we came to the port of Myra in Lycia.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">There the army captain found a ship from Alexandria that was going to Italy. So he ordered us to board that ship.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">We sailed along slowly for several days and had a hard time reaching Cnidus. The wind would not let us go any farther in that direction, so we sailed past Cape Salmone, where the island of Crete would protect us from the wind.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">We went slowly along the coast and finally reached a place called Fair Havens, not far from the town of Lasea.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">By now we had already lost a lot of time, and sailing was no longer safe. In fact, even the Great Day of Forgiveness was past.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Then Paul spoke to the crew of the ship, &amp;apos;Men, listen to me! If we sail now, our ship and its cargo will be badly damaged, and many lives will be lost.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">But Julius listened to the captain of the ship and its owner, rather than to Paul.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">The harbor at Fair Havens wasn't a good place to spend the winter. Because of this, almost everyone agreed that we should at least try to sail along the coast of Crete as far as Phoenix. It had a harbor that opened toward the southwest and northwest, and we could spend the winter there.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">When a gentle wind from the south started blowing, the men thought it was a good time to do what they had planned. So they pulled up the anchor, and we sailed along the coast of Crete.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">But soon a strong wind called &amp;apos;The Northeaster&amp;apos; blew against us from the island.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">The wind struck the ship, and we could not sail against it. So we let the wind carry the ship.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">We went along the island of Cauda on the side that was protected from the wind. We had a hard time holding the lifeboat in place,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">but finally we got it where it belonged. Then the sailors wrapped ropes around the ship to hold it together. They lowered the sail and let the ship drift along, because they were afraid it might hit the sandbanks in the gulf of Syrtis.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">The storm was so fierce that the next day they threw some of the ship's cargo overboard.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Then on the third day, with their bare hands they threw overboard some of the ship's gear.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">For several days we could not see either the sun or the stars. A strong wind kept blowing, and we finally gave up all hope of being saved.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Since none of us had eaten anything for a long time, Paul stood up and told the men:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">But now I beg you to cheer up, because you will be safe. Only the ship will be lost.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">I belong to God, and I worship him. Last night he sent an angel</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">to tell me, &amp;apos;Paul, don't be afraid! You will stand trial before the Emperor. And because of you, God will save the lives of everyone on the ship.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">Cheer up! I am sure that God will do exactly what he promised.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">But we will first be shipwrecked on some island.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">For 14 days and nights we had been blown around over the Mediterranean Sea. But about midnight the sailors realized we were getting near land.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">They measured and found that the water was about 40 meters deep. A little later they measured again and found it was only about 30 meters.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">The sailors were afraid that we might hit some rocks, and they let down four anchors from the back of the ship. Then they prayed for daylight.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">The sailors wanted to escape from the ship. So they lowered the lifeboat into the water, pretending that they were letting down some anchors from the front of the ship.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">But Paul said to Captain Julius and the soldiers, &amp;apos;If the sailors don't stay on the ship, you won't have any chance to save your lives.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">The soldiers then cut the ropes that held the lifeboat and let it fall into the sea.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">Just before daylight Paul begged the people to eat something. He told them, &amp;apos;For 14 days you have been so worried that you haven't eaten a thing.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">I beg you to eat something. Your lives depend on it. Do this and not one of you will be hurt.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">After Paul had said this, he took a piece of bread and gave thanks to God. Then in front of everyone, he broke the bread and ate some.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">They all felt encouraged, and each of them ate something.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">There were 276 people on the ship,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">and after everyone had eaten, they threw the cargo of wheat into the sea to make the ship lighter.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">Morning came, and the ship's crew saw a coast they did not recognize. But they did see a cove with a beach. So they decided to try to run the ship aground on the beach.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">They cut the anchors loose and let them sink into the sea. At the same time they untied the ropes that were holding the rudders. Next, they raised the sail at the front of the ship and let the wind carry the ship toward the beach.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">But it ran aground on a sandbank. The front of the ship stuck firmly in the sand, and the rear was being smashed by the force of the waves.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">The soldiers decided to kill the prisoners to keep them from swimming away and escaping.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43">But Captain Julius wanted to save Paul's life, and he did not let the soldiers do what they had planned. Instead, he ordered everyone who could swim to jump into the water and head for shore.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44">Then he told the others to hold on to planks of wood or parts of the ship. At last, everyone safely reached shore.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="28">
			<VERS vnumber="1">When we came ashore, we learned that the island was called Malta.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">The local people were very friendly, and they welcomed us by building a fire, because it was rainy and cold. My friends, I have never done anything to hurt our people, and I have never gone against the customs of our ancestors. But in Jerusalem I was handed over as a prisoner to the Romans. But I don't have anything to say against my own nation. &amp;quot;Go to these people and tell them: You will listen and listen, but never understand. You will look and look, but never see. have stubborn hearts. Your ears are stopped up, and your eyes are covered. You cannot see or hear or understand. If you could, you would turn to me, and I would heal you.&amp;quot; &amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">After Paul had gathered some wood and had put it on the fire, the heat caused a snake to crawl out, and it bit him on the hand.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">When the local people saw the snake hanging from Paul's hand, they said to each other, &amp;apos;This man must be a murderer! He didn't drown in the sea, but the goddess of justice will kill him anyway.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Paul shook the snake off into the fire and wasn't harmed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">The people kept thinking that Paul would either swell up or suddenly drop dead. They watched him for a long time, and when nothing happened to him, they changed their minds and said, &amp;apos;This man is a god.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">The governor of the island was named Publius, and he owned some of the land around there. Publius was very friendly and welcomed us into his home for three days.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">His father was in bed, sick with fever and stomach trouble, and Paul went to visit him. Paul healed the man by praying and placing his hands on him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">After this happened, everyone on the island brought their sick people to Paul, and they were all healed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">The people were very respectful to us, and when we sailed, they gave us everything we needed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Three months later we sailed in a ship that had been docked at Malta for the winter. The ship was from Alexandria in Egypt and was known as &amp;apos;The Twin Gods.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">We arrived in Syracuse and stayed for three days.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">From there we sailed to Rhegium. The next day a south wind began to blow, and two days later we arrived in Puteoli.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">There we found some of the Lord's followers, who begged us to stay with them. A week later we left for the city of Rome.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Some of the followers in Rome heard about us and came to meet us at the Market of Appius and at the Three Inns. When Paul saw them, he thanked God and was encouraged.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">We arrived in Rome, and Paul was allowed to live in a house by himself with a soldier to guard him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Three days after we got there, Paul called together some of the Jewish leaders and said:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">They looked into the charges against me and wanted to release me. They found that I had not done anything deserving death.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">The Jewish leaders disagreed, so I asked to be tried by the Emperor.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">I am bound by these chains because of what we people of Israel hope for. This is why I have called you here to talk about this hope of ours.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">The leaders replied, &amp;apos;No one from Judea has written us a letter about you. And not one of them has come here to report on you or to say anything against you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">But we would like to hear what you have to say. We understand that people everywhere are against this new group.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">They agreed on a time to meet with Paul, and many of them came to his house. From early morning until late in the afternoon, Paul talked to them about God's kingdom. He used the Law of Moses and the Books of the Prophets to try to win them over to Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">Some of the leaders agreed with what Paul said, but others did not.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">Since they could not agree among themselves, they started leaving. But Paul said, &amp;apos;The Holy Spirit said the right thing when he sent Isaiah the prophet</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">to tell our ancestors,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">All of you</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">For two years Paul stayed in a rented house and welcomed everyone who came to see him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">He bravely preached about God's kingdom and taught about the Lord Jesus Christ, and no one tried to stop him.</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="1">
			<VERS vnumber="1">From Paul, a servant of Christ Jesus. God chose me to be an apostle, and he appointed me to preach the good news I pray that God our Father and our Lord Jesus Christ will be kind to you and will bless you with peace! These people don't respect their parents.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">that he promised long ago by what his prophets said in the holy Scriptures.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Jesus was kind to me and chose me to be an apostle, so that people of all nations would obey and have faith.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">You are some of those people chosen by Jesus Christ.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">This letter is to all of you in Rome. God loves you and has chosen you to be his very own people.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">First, I thank God in the name of Jesus Christ for all of you. I do this because people everywhere in the world are talking about your faith.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">God has seen how I never stop praying for you, while I serve him with all my heart and tell the good news about his Son.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">In all my prayers, I ask God to make it possible for me to visit you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">I want to see you and share with you the same blessings that God's Spirit has given me. Then you will grow stronger in your faith.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">What I am saying is that we can encourage each other by the faith that is ours.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">My friends, I want you to know that I have often planned to come for a visit. But something has always kept me from doing it. I want to win followers to Christ in Rome, as I have done in many other places.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">I am proud of the good news! It is God's powerful way of saving all people who have faith, whether they are Jews or Gentiles.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">The good news tells how God accepts everyone who has faith, but only those who have faith. It is just as the Scriptures say, &amp;apos;The people God accepts because of their faith will live.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">From heaven God shows how angry he is with all the wicked and evil things that sinful people do to crush the truth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">They know everything that can be known about God, because God has shown it all to them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">God's eternal power and character cannot be seen. But from the beginning of creation, God has shown what these are like by all he has made. That's why those people don't have any excuse.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">They know about God, but they don't honor him or even thank him. Their thoughts are useless, and their stupid minds are in the dark.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">They claim to be wise, but they are fools.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">They don't worship the glorious and eternal God. Instead, they worship idols that are made to look like humans who cannot live forever, and like birds, animals, and reptiles.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">So God let these people go their own way. They did what they wanted to do, and their filthy thoughts made them do shameful things with their bodies.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">They gave up the truth about God for a lie, and they worshiped God's creation instead of God, who will be praised forever. Amen.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">God let them follow their own evil desires. Women no longer wanted to have sex in a natural way, and they did things with each other that were not natural.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">Men behaved in the same way. They stopped wanting to have sex with women and had strong desires for sex with other men. They did shameful things with each other, and what has happened to them is punishment for their foolish deeds.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">Since these people refused even to think about God, he let their useless minds rule over them. That's why they do all sorts of indecent things.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">They are evil, wicked, and greedy, as well as mean in every possible way. They want what others have, and they murder, argue, cheat, and are hard to get along with. They gossip,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">say cruel things about others, and hate God. They are proud, conceited, and boastful, always thinking up new ways to do evil.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">They are stupid, unreliable, and don't have any love or pity for others.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">They know God has said that anyone who acts this way deserves to die. But they keep on doing evil things, and they even encourage others to do them.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="2">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Some of you accuse others of doing wrong. But there is no excuse for what you do. When you judge others, you condemn yourselves, because you are guilty of doing the very same things.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">We know that God is right to judge everyone who behaves in this way.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Do you really think God won't punish you, when you behave exactly like the people you accuse?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">You surely don't think much of God's wonderful goodness or of his patience and willingness to put up with you. Don't you know that the reason God is good to you is because he wants you to turn to him?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">But you are stubborn and refuse to turn to God. So you are making things even worse for yourselves on that day when he will show how angry he is and will judge the world with fairness.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">God will reward each of us for what we have done.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">He will give eternal life to everyone who has patiently done what is good in the hope of receiving glory, honor, and life that lasts forever.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">But he will show how angry and furious he can be with every selfish person who rejects the truth and wants to do evil.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">All who are wicked will be punished with trouble and suffering. It doesn't matter if they are Jews or Gentiles.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">But all who do right will be rewarded with glory, honor, and peace, whether they are Jews or Gentiles.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">God doesn't have any favorites!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Those people who don't know about God's Law will still be punished for what they do wrong. And the Law will be used to judge everyone who knows what it says.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">God accepts those who obey his Law, but not those who simply hear it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Some people naturally obey the Law's commands, even though they don't have the Law.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">This proves that the conscience is like a law written in the human heart. And it will show whether we are forgiven or condemned,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">when God appoints Jesus Christ to judge everyone's secret thoughts, just as my message says.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Some of you call yourselves Jews. You trust in the Law and take pride in God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">By reading the Scriptures you learn how God wants you to behave, and you discover what is right.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">You are sure that you are a guide for the blind and a light for all who are in the dark.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">And since there is knowledge and truth in God's Law, you think you can instruct fools and teach young people.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">But how can you teach others when you refuse to learn? You preach it is wrong to steal. But do you steal?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">You say people should be faithful in marriage. But are you faithful? You hate idols, yet you rob their temples.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">You take pride in the Law, but you disobey the Law and bring shame to God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">It is just as the Scriptures tell us, &amp;apos;You have made foreigners say insulting things about God.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">Being circumcised is worthwhile, if you obey the Law. But if you don't obey the Law, you are no better off than people who are not circumcised.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">In fact, if they obey the Law, they are as good as anyone who is circumcised.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">So everyone who obeys the Law, but has never been circumcised, will condemn you. Even though you are circumcised and have the Law, you still don't obey its teachings.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">Just because you live like a Jew and are circumcised doesn't make you a real Jew.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">To be a real Jew you must obey the Law. True circumcision is something that happens deep in your heart, not something done to your body. And besides, you should want praise from God and not from humans.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="3">
			<VERS vnumber="1">What good is it to be a Jew? What good is it to be circumcised?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">It is good in a lot of ways! First of all, God's messages were spoken to the Jews.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">It is true that some of them did not believe the message. But does this mean that God cannot be trusted, just because they did not have faith?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">No, indeed! God tells the truth, even if everyone else is a liar. The Scriptures say about God, &amp;apos;Your words will be proven true, and in court you will win your case.&amp;apos; &amp;apos;No one is acceptable to God! or even searches for God. and are worthless. There isn't one person who does right. an open pit, and their tongues are good only for telling lies. Each word is as deadly as the fangs of a snake, but bitter curses. become violent. they leave ruin and destruction. to live in peace.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">If our evil deeds show how right God is, then what can we say? Is it wrong for God to become angry and punish us? What a foolish thing to ask.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">But the answer is, &amp;apos;No.&amp;apos; Otherwise, how could God judge the world?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Since your lies bring great honor to God by showing how truthful he is, you may ask why God still says you are a sinner.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">You might as well say, &amp;apos;Let's do something evil, so that something good will come of it!&amp;apos; Some people even claim that we are saying this. But God is fair and will judge them as well.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">What does all this mean? Does it mean that we Jews are better off than the Gentiles? No, it doesn't! Jews, as well as Gentiles, are ruled by sin, just as I have said.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">The Scriptures tell us,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Not one of them understands</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">They have all turned away</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Their words are like</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">and they say nothing</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">These people quickly</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Wherever they go,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">They don't know how</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">They don't even fear God.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">We know that everything in the Law was written for those who are under its power. The Law says these things to stop anyone from making excuses and to let God show that the whole world is guilty.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">God doesn't accept people simply because they obey the Law. No, indeed! All the Law does is to point out our sin.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Now we see how God does make us acceptable to him. The Law and the Prophets tell how we become acceptable, and it isn't by obeying the Law of Moses.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">God treats everyone alike. He accepts people only because they have faith in Jesus Christ.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">All of us have sinned and fallen short of God's glory.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">But God treats us much better than we deserve, and because of Christ Jesus, he freely accepts us and sets us free from our sins.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">What is left for us to brag about? Not a thing! Is it because we obeyed some law? No! It is because of faith.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">We see that people are acceptable to God because they have faith, and not because they obey the Law.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">Does God belong only to the Jews? Isn't he also the God of the Gentiles? Yes, he is!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">There is only one God, and he accepts Gentiles as well as Jews, simply because of their faith.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">Do we destroy the Law by our faith? Not at all! We make it even more powerful.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1">Well then, what can we say about our ancestor Abraham?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">If he became acceptable to God because of what he did, then he would have something to brag about. But he would never be able to brag about it to God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">The Scriptures say, &amp;apos;God accepted Abraham because Abraham had faith in him.&amp;apos; when God forgives our sins and our evil deeds. What a blessing when the Lord erases our sins from his book.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Money paid to workers isn't a gift. It is something they earn by working.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">But you cannot make God accept you because of something you do. God accepts sinners only because they have faith in him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">In the Scriptures David talks about the blessings that come to people who are acceptable to God, even though they don't do anything to deserve these blessings. David says,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Are these blessings meant for circumcised people or for those who are not circumcised? Well, the Scriptures say that God accepted Abraham because Abraham had faith in him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">But when did this happen? Was it before or after Abraham was circumcised? Of course, it was before.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Abraham let himself be circumcised to show he had been accepted because of his faith even before he was circumcised. This makes Abraham the father of all who are acceptable to God because of their faith, even though they are not circumcised.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">This also makes Abraham the father of everyone who is circumcised and has faith in God, as Abraham did before he was circumcised.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">God promised Abraham and his descendants that he would give them the world. This promise wasn't made because Abraham had obeyed a law, but because his faith in God made him acceptable.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">If Abraham and his descendants were given this promise because they had obeyed a law, then faith would mean nothing, and the promise would be worthless.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">God becomes angry when his Law is broken. But where there isn't a law, it cannot be broken.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Everything depends on having faith in God, so that God's promise is assured by his gift of undeserved grace. This promise isn't only for Abraham's descendants who have the Law. It is for all who are Abraham's descendants because they have faith, just as he did. Abraham is the ancestor of us all.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">The Scriptures say that Abraham would become the ancestor of many nations. This promise was made to Abraham because he had faith in God, who raises the dead to life and creates new things.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">God promised Abraham a lot of descendants. And when it all seemed hopeless, Abraham still had faith in God and became the ancestor of many nations.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Abraham's faith never became weak, not even when he was nearly 100 years old. He knew he was almost dead and that his wife Sarah could not have children.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">But Abraham never doubted or questioned God's promise. His faith made him strong, and he gave all the credit to God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Abraham was certain that God could do what he had promised.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">So God accepted him,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">just as we read in the Scriptures. But these words were not written only for Abraham.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">They were written for us, since we will also be accepted because of our faith in God, who raised our Lord Jesus to life.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">God gave Jesus to die for our sins, and he raised him to life, so that we would be made acceptable to God.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="5">
			<VERS vnumber="1">By faith we have been made acceptable to God. And now, thanks to our Lord Jesus Christ, we have peace with God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Christ has also introduced us to God's gift of undeserved grace on which we now take our stand. So we are happy, as we look forward to sharing in the glory of God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">But that's not all! We gladly suffer, because we know that suffering helps us to endure.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">And endurance builds character, which gives us a hope</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">that will never disappoint us. All of this happens because God has given us the Holy Spirit, who fills our hearts with his love. In some ways Adam is like Christ who came later.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Christ died for us at a time when we were helpless and sinful.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">No one is really willing to die for an honest person, though someone might be willing to die for a truly good person.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">But God showed how much he loved us by having Christ die for us, even though we were sinful.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">But there is more! Now that God has accepted us because Christ sacrificed his life's blood, we will also be kept safe from God's anger.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Even when we were God's enemies, he made peace with us, because his Son died for us. Yet something even greater than friendship is ours. Now that we are at peace with God, we will be saved by the life of his Son.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">And in addition to everything else, we are happy because God sent our Lord Jesus Christ to make peace with us.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Adam sinned, and that sin brought death into the world. Now everyone has sinned, and so everyone must die.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Sin was in the world before the Law came. But no record of sin was kept, because there was no Law.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Yet death still had power over all who lived from the time of Adam to the time of Moses. This happened, though not everyone disobeyed a direct command from God, as Adam did.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">But the gift of God's undeserved grace was very different from Adam's sin. That one sin brought death to many others. Yet in an even greater way, Jesus Christ alone brought God's gift of undeserved grace to many people.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">There is a lot of difference between Adam's sin and God's gift. That one sin led to punishment. But God's gift made it possible for us to be acceptable to him, even though we have sinned many times.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Death ruled like a king because Adam had sinned. But that cannot compare with what Jesus Christ has done. God has treated us with undeserved grace, and he has accepted us because of Jesus. And so we will live and rule like kings.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Everyone was going to be punished because Adam sinned. But because of the good thing that Christ has done, God accepts us and gives us the gift of life.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Adam disobeyed God and caused many others to be sinners. But Jesus obeyed him and will make many people acceptable to God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">The Law came, so that the full power of sin could be seen. Yet where sin was powerful, God's gift of undeserved grace was even more powerful.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Sin ruled by means of death. But God's gift of grace now rules, and God has accepted us because of Jesus Christ our Lord. This means that we will have eternal life.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="6">
			<VERS vnumber="1">What should we say? Should we keep on sinning, so that God's gift of undeserved grace will show up even better?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">No, we should not! If we are dead to sin, how can we go on sinning?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Don't you know that all who share in Christ Jesus by being baptized also share in his death?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">When we were baptized, we died and were buried with Christ. We were baptized, so we would live a new life, as Christ was raised to life by the glory of God the Father.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">If we shared in Jesus' death by being baptized, we will be raised to life with him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">We know that the persons we used to be were nailed to the cross with Jesus. This was done, so our sinful bodies would no longer be the slaves of sin.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">We know sin doesn't have power over dead people.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">As surely as we died with Christ, we believe we will also live with him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">We know that death no longer has any power over Christ. He died and was raised to life, never again to die.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">When Christ died, he died for sin once and for all. But now he is alive, and he lives only for God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">In the same way, you must think of yourselves as dead to the power of sin. But Christ Jesus has given life to you, and you live for God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Don't let sin rule your body. After all, your body is bound to die, so don't obey its desires</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">or let any part of it become a slave of evil. Give yourselves to God, as people who have been raised from death to life. Make every part of your body a slave that pleases God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Don't let sin keep ruling your lives. You are ruled by God's undeserved grace and not by the Law.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">What does all this mean? Does it mean we are free to sin, because we are ruled by God's gift of undeserved grace and not by the Law? Certainly not!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Don't you know that you are slaves of anyone you obey? You can be slaves of sin and die, or you can be obedient slaves of God and be acceptable to him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">You used to be slaves of sin. But I thank God that with all your heart you followed the example set forth in the teaching you received.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Now you are set free from sin and are slaves who please God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">I am using these everyday examples, because in some ways you are still weak. You used to let the different parts of your body be slaves of your evil thoughts. But now you must make every part of your body serve God, so that you will belong completely to him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">When you were slaves of sin, you didn't have to please God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">But what good did you receive from the things you did? All you have to show for them is your shame, and they lead to death.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Now you have been set free from sin, and you are God's slaves. This will make you holy and will lead you to eternal life.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">Sin pays off with death. But God's gift is eternal life given by Jesus Christ our Lord.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="7">
			<VERS vnumber="1">My friends, you surely understand enough about law to know that laws only have power over people who are alive.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">For example, the Law says that a man's wife must remain his wife as long as he lives. But once her husband is dead, she is free</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">to marry someone else. However, if she goes off with another man while her husband is still alive, she is said to be unfaithful. So with my mind I serve the Law of God, although my selfish desires make me serve the law of sin.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">That is how it is with you, my friends. You are now part of the body of Christ and are dead to the power of the Law. You are free to belong to Christ, who was raised to life so we could serve God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">When we thought only of ourselves, the Law made us have sinful desires. It made every part of our bodies into slaves who are doomed to die.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">But the Law no longer rules over us. We are like dead people, and it cannot have any power over us. Now we can serve God in a new way by obeying his Spirit, and not in the old way by obeying the written Law.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Does this mean that the Law is sinful? Certainly not! But if it had not been for the Law, I would not have known what sin is really like. For example, I would not have known what it means to want something that belongs to someone else, unless the Law had told me not to do this.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">It was sin that used this command as a way of making me have all kinds of desires. But without the Law, sin is dead.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Before I knew about the Law, I was alive. But as soon as I heard that command, sin came to life,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">and I died. The very command that was supposed to bring life to me, instead brought death.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Sin used this command to trick me, and because of it I died.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Still, the Law and its commands are holy and correct and good.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Am I saying something good caused my death? Certainly not! It was sin that killed me by using something good. Now we can see how terrible and evil sin really is.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">We know that the Law is spiritual. But I am merely a human, and I have been sold as a slave to sin.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">In fact, I don't understand why I act the way I do. I don't do what I know is right. I do the things I hate.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Although I don't do what I know is right, I agree that the Law is good.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">So I am not the one doing these evil things. The sin that lives in me is what does them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">I know that my selfish desires won't let me do anything that is good. Even when I want to do right, I cannot.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Instead of doing what I know is right, I do wrong.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">And so, if I don't do what I know is right, I am no longer the one doing these evil things. The sin that lives in me is what does them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">The Law has shown me that something in me keeps me from doing what I know is right.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">With my whole heart I agree with the Law of God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">But in every part of me I discover something fighting against my mind, and it makes me a prisoner of sin that controls everything I do.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">What a miserable person I am. Who will rescue me from this body that is doomed to die?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">Thank God! Jesus Christ will rescue me.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="8">
			<VERS vnumber="1">If you belong to Christ Jesus, you won't be punished.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">The Holy Spirit will give you life that comes from Christ Jesus and will set you free from sin and death.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">The Law of Moses cannot do this, because our selfish desires make the Law weak. But God set you free when he sent his own Son to be like us sinners and to be a sacrifice for our sin. God used Christ's body to condemn sin.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">He did this, so that we would do what the Law commands by obeying the Spirit instead of our own desires. &amp;apos;For you we face death all day long. We are like sheep on their way to be butchered.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">People who are ruled by their desires think only of themselves. Everyone who is ruled by the Holy Spirit thinks about spiritual things.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">If our minds are ruled by our desires, we will die. But if our minds are ruled by the Spirit, we will have life and peace.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Our desires fight against God, because they do not and cannot obey God's laws.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">If we follow our desires, we cannot please God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">You are no longer ruled by your desires, but by God's Spirit, who lives in you. People who don't have the Spirit of Christ in them don't belong to him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">But Christ lives in you. So you are alive because God has accepted you, even though your bodies must die because of your sins.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Yet God raised Jesus to life! God's Spirit now lives in you, and he will raise you to life by his Spirit.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">My dear friends, we must not live to satisfy our desires.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">If you do, you will die. But you will live, if by the help of God's Spirit you say &amp;apos;No&amp;apos; to your desires.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Only those people who are led by God's Spirit are his children.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">God's Spirit doesn't make us slaves who are afraid of him. Instead, we become his children and call him our Father.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">God's Spirit makes us sure that we are his children.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">His Spirit lets us know that together with Christ we will be given what God has promised. We will also share in the glory of Christ, because we have suffered with him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">I am sure what we are suffering now cannot compare with the glory that will be shown to us.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">In fact, all creation is eagerly waiting for God to show who his children are.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Meanwhile, creation is confused, but not because it wants to be confused. God made it this way in the hope</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">that creation would be set free from decay and would share in the glorious freedom of his children.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">We know that all creation is still groaning and is in pain, like a woman about to give birth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">The Spirit makes us sure about what we will be in the future. But now we groan silently, while we wait for God to show that we are his children. This means that our bodies will also be set free.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">And this hope is what saves us. But if we already have what we hope for, there is no need to keep on hoping.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">However, we hope for something we have not yet seen, and we patiently wait for it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">In certain ways we are weak, but the Spirit is here to help us. For example, when we don't know what to pray for, the Spirit prays for us in ways that cannot be put into words.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">All of our thoughts are known to God. He can understand what is in the mind of the Spirit, as the Spirit prays for God's people.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">We know that God is always at work for the good of everyone who loves him. They are the ones God has chosen for his purpose,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">and he has always known who his chosen ones would be. He had decided to let them become like his own Son, so his Son would be the first of many children.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">God then accepted the people he had already decided to choose, and he has shared his glory with them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">What can we say about all this? If God is on our side, can anyone be against us?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">God did not keep back his own Son, but he gave him for us. If God did this, won't he freely give us everything else?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">If God says his chosen ones are acceptable to him, can anyone bring charges against them?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">Or can anyone condemn them? No indeed! Christ died and was raised to life, and now he is at God's right side, speaking to him for us.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">Can anything separate us from the love of Christ? Can trouble, suffering, and hard times, or hunger and nakedness, or danger and death?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">It is exactly as the Scriptures say,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">In everything we have won more than a victory because of Christ who loves us.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">I am sure that nothing can separate us from God's love&amp;ndash;not life or death, not angels or spirits, not the present or the future,</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="4">But the Lord told Elijah, &amp;apos;I still have 7,000 followers who have not worshiped Baal.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">It is the same way now. God treated the people of Israel with undeserved grace, and so a few of them are still his followers.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">This happened because of God's undeserved kindness and not because of anything they have done. It could not have happened except for God's gift of undeserved grace.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">This means that only a chosen few of the people of Israel found what all of them were searching for. And the rest of them were stubborn,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">just as the Scriptures say,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Then David said,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Blindfold their eyes!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Do I mean that the people of Israel fell, never to get up again? Certainly not! Their failure made it possible for the Gentiles to be saved, and this will make the people of Israel jealous.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">But if the rest of the world's people were helped so much by their sin and loss, they will be helped even more by their full return.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">I am now speaking to you Gentiles, and as long as I am an apostle to you, I will take pride in my work.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">I hope in this way to make some of my own people jealous enough to be saved.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">When Israel rejected God, the rest of the people in the world were able to turn to him. So when God makes friends with Israel, it will be like bringing the dead back to life.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">If part of a batch of dough is made holy by being offered to God, then all of the dough is holy. If the roots of a tree are holy, the rest of the tree is holy too.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">You Gentiles are like branches of a wild olive tree made to be part of a cultivated olive tree. You have taken the place of some branches that were cut away from it. And because of this, you enjoy the blessings that come from being part of that cultivated tree.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">But don't think you are better than the branches that were cut away. Just remember you are not supporting the roots of this tree. Its roots are supporting you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Maybe you think those branches were cut away, so you could be put in their place.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">That's true enough. But they were cut away because they did not have faith, and you are where you are because you do have faith. So don't be proud, but be afraid.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">If God cut away those natural branches, couldn't he do the same to you?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Now you see both how kind and how hard God can be. He was hard on those who fell, but he was kind to you. And he will keep on being kind to you, if you keep on trusting in his kindness. Otherwise, you will be cut away too.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">If those other branches will start having faith, they will be made a part of that tree again. God has the power to put them back.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">After all, it wasn't natural for branches to be cut from a wild olive tree and to be made part of a cultivated olive tree. So it is much more likely that God will join the natural branches back to the cultivated olive tree.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">My friends, I don't want you Gentiles to be too proud of yourselves. So I will explain the mystery of what has happened to the people of Israel. Some of them have become stubborn, and they will stay like that until the complete number of you Gentiles has come in.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">In this way all of Israel will be saved, as the Scriptures say,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">This is what the Lord</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">The people of Israel are treated as God's enemies, so the good news can come to you Gentiles. But they are still the chosen ones, and God loves them because of their famous ancestors.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">God doesn't take back the gifts he has given or disown the people he has chosen.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">At one time you Gentiles rejected God. But now Israel has rejected God, and you have been shown mercy.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">And because of the mercy shown to you, they will also be shown mercy.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">All people have disobeyed God, and that's why he treats them as prisoners. But he does this, so that he can have mercy on all of them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">Who can measure the wealth and wisdom and knowledge of God? Who can understand his decisions or explain what he does?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">&amp;apos;Has anyone known</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">Has anyone loaned</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1">Dear friends, God is good. So I beg you to offer your bodies to him as a living sacrifice, pure and pleasing. That's the most sensible way to serve God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Don't be like the people of this world, but let God change the way you think. Then you will know how to do everything that is good and pleasing to him. &amp;apos;I am the one to take revenge and pay them back.&amp;apos; &amp;apos;If your enemies are hungry, give them something to eat. And if they are thirsty, give them something to drink. This will be the same as piling burning coals on their heads.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">I realize God has treated me with undeserved grace, and so I tell each of you not to think you are better than you really are. Use good sense and measure yourself by the amount of faith that God has given you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">A body is made up of many parts, and each of them has its own use.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">That's how it is with us. There are many of us, but we each are part of the body of Christ, as well as part of one another.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">God has also given each of us different gifts to use. If we can prophesy, we should do it according to the amount of faith we have.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">If we can serve others, we should serve. If we can teach, we should teach.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">If we can encourage others, we should encourage them. If we can give, we should be generous. If we are leaders, we should do our best. If we are good to others, we should do it cheerfully.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1">Obey the rulers who have authority over you. Only God can give authority to anyone, and he puts these rulers in their places of power.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">People who oppose the authorities are opposing what God has done, and they will be punished.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Rulers are a threat to evil people, not to good people. There is no need to be afraid of the authorities. Just do right, and they will praise you for it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">After all, they are God's servants, and it is their duty to help you. If you do something wrong, you ought to be afraid, because these rulers have the right to punish you. They are God's servants who punish criminals to show how angry God is.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">But you should obey the rulers because you know it is the right thing to do, and not just because of God's anger.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">You must also pay your taxes. The authorities are God's servants, and it is their duty to take care of these matters.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Pay all that you owe, whether it is taxes and fees or respect and honor.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Let love be your only debt! If you love others, you have done all that the Law demands.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">In the Law there are many commands, such as, &amp;apos;Be faithful in marriage. Do not murder. Do not steal. Do not want what belongs to others.&amp;apos; But all of these are summed up in the command that says, &amp;apos;Love others as much as you love yourself.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">No one who loves others will harm them. So love is all that the Law demands.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">You know what sort of times we live in, and so you should live properly. It is time to wake up. You know that the day when we will be saved is nearer now than when we first put our faith in the Lord.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Night is almost over, and day will soon appear. We must stop behaving as people do in the dark and be ready to live in the light.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">So behave properly, as people do in the day. Don't go to wild parties or get drunk or be vulgar or indecent. Don't quarrel or be jealous.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="3">But you should not criticize others for eating or for not eating. After all, God welcomes everyone.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">What right do you have to criticize someone else's servants? Only their Lord can decide if they are doing right, and the Lord will make sure that they do right. &amp;apos;I swear by my very life that everyone will kneel down and praise my name!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Some of the Lord's followers think one day is more important than another. Others think all days are the same. But each of you should make up your own mind.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Any followers who count one day more important than another day do it to honor their Lord. And any followers who eat meat give thanks to God, just like the ones who don't eat meat.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Whether we live or die, it must be for God, rather than for ourselves.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Whether we live or die, it must be for the Lord. Alive or dead, we still belong to the Lord.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">This is because Christ died and rose to life, so that he would be the Lord of the dead and of the living.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Why do you criticize other followers of the Lord? Why do you look down on them? The day is coming when God will judge all of us.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">In the Scriptures God says,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">And so, each of us must give an account to God for what we do.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">We must stop judging others. We must also make up our minds not to upset anyone's faith.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">The Lord Jesus has made it clear to me that God considers all foods fit to eat. But if you think some foods are unfit to eat, then for you they are not fit.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">If you are hurting others by the foods you eat, you are not guided by love. Don't let your appetite destroy someone Christ died for.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Don't let your right to eat bring shame to Christ.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">God's kingdom isn't about eating and drinking. It is about pleasing God, about living in peace, and about true happiness. All this comes from the Holy Spirit.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">If you serve Christ in this way, you will please God and be respected by people.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">We should try to live at peace and help each other have a strong faith.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Don't let your appetite destroy what God has done. All foods are fit to eat, but it is wrong to cause problems for others by what you eat.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">It is best not to eat meat or drink wine or do anything else that causes problems for other followers of the Lord.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">What you believe about these things should be kept between you and God. You are fortunate, if your actions don't make you have doubts.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">But if you do have doubts about what you eat, you are going against your beliefs. And you know that is wrong, because anything you do against your beliefs is sin.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="3">Even Christ did not try to please himself. But as the Scriptures say, &amp;apos;The people who insulted you also insulted me.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">And the Scriptures were written to teach and encourage us by giving us hope.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">God is the one who makes us patient and cheerful. I pray that he will help you live at peace with each other, as you follow Christ.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Then all of you together will praise God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. &amp;apos;I will tell the nations about you, and I will sing praises to your name.&amp;apos; &amp;apos;Praise the Lord, all you Gentiles.

			<VERS vnumber="7">Honor God by accepting each other, as Christ has accepted you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">I tell you that Christ came as a servant of the Jews to show that God has kept the promises he made to their famous ancestors. Christ also came,</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="10">The Scriptures also say to the Gentiles, &amp;apos;Come and celebrate with God's people.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Again the Scriptures say,</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="15">But I have spoken to you plainly and have tried to remind you of some things. God treated me with undeserved grace!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">He chose me to be a servant of Christ Jesus for the Gentiles and to do the work of a priest in the service of his good news. God did this so that the Holy Spirit could make the Gentiles into a holy offering, pleasing to him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Because of Christ Jesus, I can take pride in my service for God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">In fact, all I will talk about is how Christ let me speak and work, so that the Gentiles would obey him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Indeed, I will tell how Christ worked miracles and wonders by the power of the Holy Spirit. I have preached the good news about him all the way from Jerusalem to Illyricum.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">But I have always tried to preach where people have never heard about Christ. I am like a builder who doesn't build on someone else's foundation.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">It is just as the Scriptures say,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">My work has always kept me from coming to see you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">Now there is nothing left for me to do in this part of the world, and for years I have wanted to visit you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">So I plan to stop off on my way to Spain. Then after a short, but refreshing, visit with you, I hope you will quickly send me on.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">This is something they really wanted to do. But sharing their money with the Jews was also like paying back a debt, because the Jews had already shared their spiritual blessings with the Gentiles.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">After I have safely delivered this money, I will visit you and then go on to Spain.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">And when I do arrive in Rome, I know it will be with the full blessings of Christ.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">My friends, by the power of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the love that comes from the Holy Spirit, I beg you to pray sincerely with me and for me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">Pray that God will protect me from the unbelievers in Judea, and that his people in Jerusalem will be pleased with what I am doing.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1">From Paul, chosen by God to be an apostle of Christ Jesus, and from Sosthenes, who is also a follower. &amp;apos;I will destroy the wisdom of all who claim to be wise. I will confuse those who think they know so much.&amp;apos; Instead, God chose to save only those who believe the foolish message we preach.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">To God's church in Corinth. Christ Jesus chose you to be his very own people, and you worship in his name, as we and all others do who call him Lord.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">My prayer is that God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ will be kind to you and will bless you with peace!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">I never stop thanking my God for treating you with undeserved grace by giving you Christ Jesus,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">who helps you speak and understand so well.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Now you are certain that everything we told you about our Lord Christ Jesus is true.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">You are not missing out on any blessings, as you wait for him to return.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">And until the day Christ does return, he will keep you completely innocent.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">God can be trusted, and he chose you to be partners with his Son, our Lord Jesus Christ.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">My dear friends, as a follower of our Lord Jesus Christ, I beg you to get along with each other. Don't take sides. Always try to agree in what you think.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Several people from Chloe's family have already reported to me that you keep arguing with each other.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">They have said that some of you claim to follow me, while others claim to follow Apollos or Peter or Christ.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Has Christ been divided up? Was I nailed to a cross for you? Were you baptized in my name?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">I thank God that I didn't baptize any of you except Crispus and Gaius.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Not one of you can say that you were baptized in my name.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">I did baptize the family of Stephanas, but I don't remember if I baptized anyone else.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Christ did not send me to baptize. He sent me to tell the good news without using words that sound wise and would make the cross of Christ lose its power.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">The message about the cross doesn't make any sense to lost people. But for those of us who are being saved, it is God's power at work.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">As God says in the Scriptures,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">What happened to those wise people? What happened to those experts in the Scriptures? What happened to the ones who think they have all the answers? Didn't God show that the wisdom of this world is foolish?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">God was wise and decided not to let the people of this world use their wisdom to learn about him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Jews ask for miracles, and Greeks want something that sounds wise.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">But we preach that Christ was nailed to a cross. Most Jews have problems with this, and most Gentiles think it is foolish.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">Our message is God's power and wisdom for the Jews and the Greeks that he has chosen.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">Even when God is foolish, he is wiser than everyone else, and even when God is weak, he is stronger than everyone else.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">My dear friends, remember what you were when God chose you. The people of this world didn't think that many of you were wise. Only a few of you were in places of power, and not many of you came from important families.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">But God chose the foolish things of this world to put the wise to shame. He chose the weak things of this world to put the powerful to shame.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">What the world thinks is worthless, useless, and nothing at all is what God has used to destroy what the world considers important.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">God did all this to keep anyone from bragging to him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">You are God's children. He sent Christ Jesus to save us and to make us wise, acceptable, and holy.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">So if you want to brag, do what the Scriptures say and brag about the Lord.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="2">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Friends, when I came and told you the mystery that God had shared with us, I didn't use big words or try to sound wise.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">In fact, while I was with you, I made up my mind to speak only about Jesus Christ, who had been nailed to a cross. &amp;apos;What God has planned for people who love him is more than eyes have seen or ears have heard. It has never even entered our minds!&amp;apos; &amp;apos;Has anyone ever known the thoughts of the Lord or given him advice?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">At first, I was weak and trembling with fear.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">When I talked with you or preached, I didn't try to prove anything by sounding wise. I simply let God's Spirit show his power.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">That way you would have faith because of God's power and not because of human wisdom.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">We do use wisdom when speaking to people who are mature in their faith. But it isn't the wisdom of this world or of its rulers, who will soon disappear.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">We speak of God's hidden and mysterious wisdom that God decided to use for our glory long before the world began.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">The rulers of this world didn't know anything about this wisdom. If they had known about it, they would not have nailed the glorious Lord to a cross.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">But it is just as the Scriptures say,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">God's Spirit has shown you everything. His Spirit finds out everything, even what is deep in the mind of God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">You are the only one who knows what is in your own mind, and God's Spirit is the only one who knows what is in God's mind.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">But God has given us his Spirit. This is why we don't think the same way that the people of this world think. This is also why we can recognize the blessings God has given us.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Every word we speak was taught to us by God's Spirit, not by human wisdom. And this same Spirit helps us teach spiritual things to spiritual people.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">This is why only someone who has God's Spirit can understand spiritual blessings. Anyone who doesn't have God's Spirit thinks these blessings are foolish.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">People who are guided by the Spirit can make all kinds of judgments, but they cannot be judged by others.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">The Scriptures ask, But we understand what Christ is thinking.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="3">
			<VERS vnumber="1">My friends, you are acting like the people of this world. That's why I could not speak to you as spiritual people. You are like babies as far as your faith in Christ is concerned.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">So I had to treat you like babies and feed you milk. You could not take solid food, and you still cannot,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">because you are not yet spiritual. You are jealous and argue with each other. This proves you are not spiritual and you are acting like the people of this world.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Some of you say you follow me, and others claim to follow Apollos. Isn't this how ordinary people behave?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Apollos and I are merely servants who helped you to have faith. It was the Lord who made it all happen.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">I planted the seeds, Apollos watered them, but God made them sprout and grow.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">What matters isn't those who planted or watered, but God who made the plants grow.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">The one who plants is just as important as the one who waters. And each one will be paid for what they do.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Apollos and I work together for God, and you are God's garden and God's building.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">God treated me with undeserved grace and let me become an expert builder. I laid a foundation on which others have built. But we must each be careful how we build,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">because Christ is the only foundation.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">We will be rewarded if our building is left standing.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">But if it is destroyed by the fire, we will lose everything. Yet we ourselves will be saved, like someone escaping from flames.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">All of you surely know you are God's temple and his Spirit lives in you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Together you are God's holy temple, and God will destroy anyone who destroys his temple.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Don't fool yourselves! If any of you think you are wise in the things of this world, you will have to become foolish before you can be truly wise.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">This is because God considers the wisdom of this world to be foolish. It is just as the Scriptures say, &amp;apos;God catches the wise when they try to outsmart him.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">The Scriptures also say, &amp;apos;The Lord knows that the plans made by wise people are useless.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">and you belong to Christ, and Christ belongs to God.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1">Think of us as servants of Christ who have been given the work of explaining God's mysterious ways.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">And since our first duty is to be faithful to the one we work for,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">it doesn't matter to me if I am judged by you or even by a court of law. In fact, I don't judge myself.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">I don't know of anything against me, but this doesn't prove I am right. The Lord is my judge.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">So don't judge anyone until the Lord returns. He will show what is hidden in the dark and what is in everyone's heart. Then God will be the one who praises each of us.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Friends, I have used Apollos and myself as examples to teach you the meaning of the saying, &amp;apos;Follow the rules.&amp;apos; I want you to stop saying one of us is better than the other.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">What is so special about you? What do you have that you were not given? And if it was given to you, how can you brag?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Are you already satisfied? Are you now rich? Have you become kings while we are still nobodies? I wish you were kings. Then we could have a share in your kingdom.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">It seems to me that God has put us apostles in the worst possible place. We are like prisoners on their way to death. Angels and the people of this world just laugh at us.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Because of Christ we are thought of as fools, but Christ has made you wise. We are weak and hated, but you are powerful and respected.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Even today we go hungry and thirsty and don't have anything to wear except rags. We are mistreated and don't have a place to live.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">We work hard with our own hands, and when people abuse us, we wish them well. When we suffer, we are patient.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">When someone curses us, we answer with kind words. Until now we are thought of as nothing more than the trash and garbage of this world.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">I am not writing to embarrass you. I want to help you, just as parents help their own dear children.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Ten thousand people may teach you about Christ, but I am your only father. You became my children when I told you about Christ Jesus,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">and I want you to be like me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">This is why I sent Timothy to you. I love him like a son, and he is a faithful servant of the Lord. Timothy will tell you what I do to follow Christ and how it agrees with what I always teach about Christ in every church.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Some of you think I am not coming for a visit, and so you are bragging.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">But if the Lord lets me come, I will soon be there. Then I will find out if the ones who are doing all this bragging really have any power.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">God's kingdom isn't just a lot of words. It is power.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1">I have heard terrible things about some of you. In fact, you are behaving worse than Gentiles. A man is even sleeping with his own stepmother.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">You are proud, when you ought to feel bad enough to chase away anyone who acts like this.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">You must then hand that man over to Satan. His body will be destroyed, but his spirit will be saved when the Lord Jesus returns.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Stop being proud! Don't you know how a little yeast can spread through the whole batch of dough?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Get rid of the old yeast! Then you will be like fresh bread made without yeast, and this is what you are. Our Passover lamb is Christ, who has already been sacrificed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">So don't celebrate the festival by being evil and sinful, which is like serving bread made with yeast. Be pure and truthful and celebrate by using bread made without yeast.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">In my other letter I told you not to have anything to do with immoral people.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">But I wasn't talking about the people of this world. You would have to leave this world to get away from everyone who is immoral or greedy or who cheats or worships idols.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">I was talking about your own people who are immoral or greedy or worship idols or curse others or get drunk or cheat. Don't even eat with them!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Why should I judge outsiders? Aren't we supposed to judge only church members?</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="3">Don't you know we will judge angels? And if this is so, we can surely judge everyday matters.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Why do you take everyday complaints to judges who are not respected by the church?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">I say this to your shame. Aren't any of you wise enough to act as a judge between one follower and another?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Why should one of you take another to be tried by unbelievers?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">When one of you takes another to court, all of you lose. It would be better to let yourselves be cheated and robbed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">But instead, you cheat and rob other followers.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Don't you know that evil people won't have a share in the blessings of God's kingdom? Don't fool yourselves! No one who is immoral or worships idols or is unfaithful in marriage or is a pervert or behaves like a homosexual</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="11">Some of you used to be like that. But now the name of our Lord Jesus Christ and the power of God's Spirit have washed you and made you holy and acceptable to God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Some of you say, &amp;apos;We can do anything we want to.&amp;apos; But I tell you not everything is good for us. So I refuse to let anything have power over me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">You also say, &amp;apos;Food is meant for our bodies, and our bodies are meant for food.&amp;apos; But I tell you that God will destroy them both. We are not supposed to do indecent things with our bodies. We are to use them for the Lord who is in charge of our bodies.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">God will raise us from death by the same power he used when he raised our Lord to life.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Don't you know that your bodies are part of the body of Christ? Is it right for me to join part of the body of Christ to a prostitute? No, it isn't!</VERS>

		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="7">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Now I will answer the questions you asked in your letter. You asked, &amp;apos;Is it best for people not to marry?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Well, having your own husband or wife should keep you from doing something immoral.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Husbands and wives should be fair with each other about having sex.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">A wife belongs to her husband instead of to herself, and a husband belongs to his wife instead of to himself.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">So don't refuse sex to each other, unless you agree not to have sex for a little while, in order to spend time in prayer. Then Satan won't be able to tempt you because of your lack of self-control.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">In my opinion that is what should be done, though I don't know of anything the Lord said about this matter.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">I wish all of you were like me, but God has given different gifts to each of us.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">My advice for the unmarried and for widows is that it is acceptable for them to remain single, just as I am.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">But if you don't have enough self-control, then go ahead and get married. After all, it is better to marry than to burn with desire.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">I instruct married couples to stay together, and this is exactly what the Lord himself taught. A wife who leaves her husband</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">should either stay single or go back to her husband. And a husband should not leave his wife.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">I don't know of anything else the Lord said about marriage. All I can do is to give you my own advice. If your wife isn't a follower of the Lord, but is willing to stay with you, don't divorce her.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">If your husband isn't a follower, but is willing to stay with you, don't divorce him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Your husband or wife who isn't a follower is made holy by having you as a partner. This also makes your children holy and keeps them from being unclean in God's sight.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">If your husband or wife isn't a follower of the Lord and decides to divorce you, then you should agree to it. You are no longer bound to that person. After all, God chose you and wants you to live at peace.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">And besides, how do you know if you will be able to save your husband or wife who isn't a follower?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">In every church I tell the people to stay as they were when the Lord Jesus chose them and God called them to be his own. Now I say the same thing to you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">If you are already circumcised, don't try to change it. If you are not circumcised, don't get circumcised.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Being circumcised or uncircumcised isn't really what matters. The important thing is to obey God's commands.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">So don't try to change what you were when God chose you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Are you a slave? Don't let that bother you. But if you can win your freedom, you should.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">When the Lord chooses slaves, they become his free people. And when he chooses free people, they become slaves of Christ.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">God paid a great price for you. So don't become slaves of anyone else.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">Stay what you were when God chose you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">I don't know of anything the Lord said about people who have never been married. But I will tell you what I think. And you can trust me, because the Lord has treated me with kindness.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">We are now going through hard times, and I think it is best for you to stay as you are.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">If you are married, stay married. If you are not married, don't try to get married.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">It isn't wrong to marry, even if you have never been married before. But those who marry will have a lot of trouble, and I want to protect you from this.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">My friends, what I mean is that the Lord will soon come, and it won't matter if you are married or not.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">It will be all the same if you are crying or laughing, or if you are buying or are completely broke.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">It won't make any difference how much good you are getting from this world or how much you like it. This world as we know it is now passing away.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">I want all of you to be free from worry. An unmarried man worries about how to please the Lord.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">But a married man has more worries. He must worry about the things of this world, because he wants to please his wife.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">So he is pulled in two directions. Unmarried women and women who have never been married worry only about pleasing the Lord, and they keep their bodies and minds pure. But a married woman worries about the things of this world, because she wants to please her husband.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">What I am saying is for your own good&amp;ndash;it isn't to limit your freedom. I want to help you to live right and to love the Lord above all else.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">But suppose you are engaged to someone old enough to be married, and you want her so much that all you can think about is getting married. Then go ahead and marry. There is nothing wrong with that.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">But it is better to have self-control and to make up your mind not to marry.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">It is perfectly all right to marry, but it is better not to get married at all.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">A wife should stay married to her husband until he dies. Then she is free to marry again, but only to a man who is a follower of the Lord.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">However, I think I am obeying God's Spirit when I say she would be happier to stay single.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="8">
			<VERS vnumber="1">In your letter you asked me about food offered to idols. All of us know something about this subject. But knowledge makes us proud of ourselves, while love makes us helpful to others.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">In fact, people who think they know so much don't know anything at all.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">But God has no doubts about who loves him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Even though food is offered to idols, we know that none of the idols in this world are alive. After all, there is only one God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Many things in heaven and on earth are called gods and lords, but none of them really are gods or lords.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">We have only one God, and he is the Father. He created everything, and we live for him. Jesus Christ is our only Lord. Everything was made by him, and by him life was given to us.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Not everyone knows these things. In fact, many people have grown up with the belief that idols have life in them. So when they eat meat offered to idols, they are bothered by a weak conscience.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">But food doesn't bring us any closer to God. We are no worse off if we don't eat, and we are no better off if we do.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Don't cause problems for someone with a weak conscience, just because you have the right to eat anything.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">You know all this, and so it doesn't bother you to eat in the temple of an idol. But suppose a person with a weak conscience sees you and decides to eat food that has been offered to idols.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Then what you know has destroyed someone Christ died for.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">When you sin by hurting a follower with a weak conscience, you sin against Christ.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">So if I hurt one of the Lord's followers by what I eat, I will never eat meat as long as I live.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="3">When people question me, I tell them</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">that Barnabas and I have the right to our food and drink.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">We each have the right to marry one of the Lord's followers and to take her along with us, just as the other apostles and the Lord's brothers and Peter do.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Are we the only ones who have to support ourselves by working at another job?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Do soldiers pay their own salaries? Don't people who raise grapes eat some of what they grow? Don't shepherds get milk from their own goats?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">No, he wasn't! He was talking about us. This was written in the Scriptures so that all who plow and all who grind the grain will look forward to sharing in the harvest.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">When we told the message to you, it was like planting spiritual seed. So we have the right to accept material things as our harvest from you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">If others have the right to do this, we have an even greater right. But we haven't used this right of ours. We are willing to put up with anything to keep from causing trouble for the message about Christ.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Don't you know that people who work in the temple make their living from what is brought to the temple? Don't you know that a person who serves at the altar is given part of what is offered?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">In the same way, the Lord wants everyone who preaches the good news to make a living from preaching this message.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">But I have never used these privileges of mine, and I am not writing this because I want to start now. I would rather die than have someone rob me of the right to take pride in this.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">I don't have any reason to brag about preaching the good news. Preaching is something God told me to do, and if I don't do it, I am doomed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">If I preach because I want to, I will be paid. But even if I don't want to, it is still something God has sent me to do.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">What pay am I given? It is the chance to preach the good news free of charge and not to use the privileges that are mine because I am a preacher.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">I am not anyone's slave. But I have become a slave to everyone, so I can win as many people as possible.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">When I am with the Jews, I live like a Jew to win Jews. They are ruled by the Law of Moses, and I am not. But I live by the Law to win them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">And when I am with people who are not ruled by the Law, I forget about the Law to win them. Of course, I never really forget about the law of God. In fact, I am ruled by the law of Christ.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">When I am with people whose faith is weak, I live as they do to win them. I do everything I can to win everyone I possibly can.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">I do all this for the good news, because I want to share in its blessings.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">You know that many runners enter a race, and only one of them wins the prize. So run to win!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">Athletes work hard to win a crown that cannot last, but we do it for a crown that will last forever.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">I don't run without a goal. And I don't box by beating my fists in the air.</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="10">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Friends, I want to remind you that all our ancestors walked under the cloud and went through the sea.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">This was like being baptized and becoming followers of Moses.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">All of them also ate the same spiritual food</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">and drank the same spiritual drink, which flowed from the spiritual rock that followed them. That rock was Christ.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">But most of them did not please God. So they died, and their bodies were scattered all over the desert.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">What happened to them is a warning to keep us from wanting to do the same evil things.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">They worshiped idols, just as the Scriptures say, &amp;apos;The people sat down to eat and drink. Then they got up to dance around.&amp;apos; So don't worship idols.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Some of those people did shameful things, and in a single day about 23,000 died. Don't do shameful things as they did.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">And don't try to test Christ, as some of them did and were later bitten by poisonous snakes.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Don't even grumble, as some of them did and were killed by the destroying angel.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">These things happened to them as a warning to us. All this was written in the Scriptures to teach us who live in these last days.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Even if you think you can stand up to temptation, be careful not to fall.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">You are tempted in the same way that everyone else is tempted. But God can be trusted not to let you be tempted too much, and he will show you how to escape from your temptations.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">My friends, you must keep away from idols.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">I am speaking to you as people who have enough sense to know what I am talking about.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">When we drink from the cup we ask God to bless, isn't that sharing in the blood of Christ? When we eat the bread we break, isn't that sharing in the body of Christ?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">By sharing in the same loaf of bread, we become one body, even though there are many of us.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Aren't the people of Israel sharing in the worship when they gather around the altar and eat the sacrifices offered there?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Am I saying that either the idols or the food sacrificed to them is anything at all?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">No, I am not! This food is really sacrificed to demons and not to God. I don't want you to have anything to do with demons.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">You cannot drink from the cup of demons and still drink from the Lord's cup. You cannot eat at the table of demons and still eat at the Lord's table.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">We would make the Lord jealous if we did this. And we are not stronger than the Lord.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">Some of you say, &amp;apos;We can do whatever we want to!&amp;apos; But I tell you not everything may be good or helpful.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">We should think about others and not about ourselves.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">However, when you buy meat in the market, go ahead and eat it. Keep your conscience clear by not asking where the meat came from.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">The Scriptures say, &amp;apos;The earth and everything in it belong to the Lord.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">If an unbeliever invites you to dinner, and you want to go, then go. Eat whatever you are served. Don't cause a problem for someone's conscience by asking where the food came from.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="3">Now I want you to know that Christ is the head of all men, and a man is the head of a woman. But God is the head of Christ.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">This means that any man who prays or prophesies with something on his head brings shame to his head.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">But any woman who prays or prophesies without something on her head brings shame to her head. In fact, she may as well shave her head.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">A woman should wear something on her head. It is a disgrace for a woman to shave her head or cut her hair. But if she refuses to wear something on her head, let her cut off her hair.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Men were created to be like God and to bring honor to God. This means a man should not wear anything on his head. Women were created to bring honor to men.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">It was the woman who was made from a man, and not the man who was made from a woman.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">He wasn't created for her. She was created for him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">And so, because of this, and also because of the angels, a woman ought to wear something on her head, as a sign of her authority.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">As far as the Lord is concerned, men and women need each other.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">It is true that the first woman came from a man, but all other men have been given birth by women. Yet God is the one who created everything.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Ask yourselves if it is proper for a woman to pray without something on her head.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Isn't it unnatural and disgraceful for men to have long hair?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">But long hair is a beautiful way for a woman to cover her head.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="23">I have already told you what the Lord Jesus did on the night he was betrayed. And it came from the Lord himself.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">Then after he had given thanks, he broke it and said, &amp;apos;This is my body, which is given for you. Eat this and remember me.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">After the meal, Jesus took a cup of wine in his hands and said, &amp;apos;This is my blood, and with it God makes his new agreement with you. Drink this and remember me.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">The Lord meant that when you eat this bread and drink from this cup, you tell about his death until he comes.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">But if you eat the bread and drink the wine in a way that isn't worthy of the Lord, you sin against his body and blood.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">This is why you must examine the way you eat and drink.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">If you fail to understand that you are the body of the Lord, you will condemn yourselves by the way you eat and drink.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1">My friends, you asked me about spiritual gifts.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">I want you to remember that before you became followers of the Lord, you were led in all the wrong ways by idols that cannot even talk.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Now I want you to know that if you are led by God's Spirit, you will say that Jesus is Lord, and you will never curse Jesus. God put our bodies together in such a way that even the parts that seem the least important are valuable.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">There are different kinds of spiritual gifts, but they all come from the same Spirit.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">There are different ways to serve the same Lord,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">and we can each do different things. Yet the same God works in all of us and helps us in everything we do.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">The Spirit has given each of us a special way of serving others.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Some of us can speak with wisdom, while others can speak with knowledge, but these gifts come from the same Spirit.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">To others the Spirit has given great faith or the power to heal the sick</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">or the power to work mighty miracles. Some of us are prophets, and some of us recognize when God's Spirit is present. Others can speak different kinds of languages, and still others can tell what these languages mean.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">But it is the Spirit who does all this and decides which gifts to give to each of us.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">The body of Christ has many different parts, just as any other body does.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Some of us are Jews, and others are Gentiles. Some of us are slaves, and others are free. But God's Spirit baptized each of us and made us part of the body of Christ. Now we each drink from that same Spirit.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Our bodies don't have just one part. They have many parts.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Suppose a foot says, &amp;apos;I'm not a hand, and so I'm not part of the body.&amp;apos; Wouldn't the foot still belong to the body?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Or suppose an ear says, &amp;apos;I'm not an eye, and so I'm not part of the body.&amp;apos; Wouldn't the ear still belong to the body?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">If our bodies were only an eye, we couldn't hear a thing. And if they were only an ear, we couldn't smell a thing.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">But God has put all parts of our body together in the way that he decided is best.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">A body isn't really a body, unless there is more than one part.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">It takes many parts to make a single body.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">That's why the eyes cannot say they don't need the hands. That's also why the head cannot say it doesn't need the feet.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">In fact, we cannot get along without the parts of the body that seem to be the weakest.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">We take special care to dress up some parts of our bodies. We are modest about our personal parts,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">but we don't have to be modest about other parts.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">He did this to make all parts of the body work together smoothly, with each part caring about the others.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">If one part of our body hurts, we hurt all over. If one part of our body is honored, the whole body will be happy.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">Together you are the body of Christ. Each one of you is part of his body.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">First, God chose some people to be apostles and prophets and teachers for the church. But he also chose some to work miracles or heal the sick or help others or be leaders or speak different kinds of languages.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">Not everyone is an apostle. Not everyone is a prophet. Not everyone is a teacher. Not everyone can work miracles.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">Not everyone can heal the sick. Not everyone can speak different kinds of languages. Not everyone can tell what these languages mean.</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="14">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Love should be your guide. Be eager to have the gifts that come from the Holy Spirit, especially the gift of prophecy.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">If you speak languages that others don't know, God will understand what you are saying, though no one else will know what you mean. You will be talking about mysteries that only the Spirit understands.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">But when you prophesy, you will be understood, and others will be helped. They will be encouraged and made to feel better. &amp;apos;I will use strangers who speak unknown languages to talk to my people. They will speak to them in foreign languages, but still my people won't listen to me.&amp;apos; When God's people meet in church,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">By speaking languages that others don't know, you help only yourself. But by prophesying you help everyone in the church.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">I am glad for you to speak unknown languages, although I prefer that you would prophesy. In fact, prophesying does much more good than speaking unknown languages, unless someone can help the church by explaining what you mean.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">My friends, what good would it do, if I came and spoke unknown languages to you and didn't explain what I meant? How would I help you, unless I told you what God had shown me or gave you some knowledge or prophecy or teaching?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">If all musical instruments sounded alike, how would you know the difference between a flute and a harp?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">If a bugle call isn't clear, how would you know to get ready for battle?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">This is how it is when you speak unknown languages. If no one can understand what you are talking about, you will only be talking to the wind.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">There are many different languages in this world, and all of them make sense.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">But if I don't understand the language that someone is using, we will be like foreigners to each other.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">If you really want spiritual gifts, choose the ones that will be most helpful to the church.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">When we speak languages that others don't know, we should pray for the power to explain what we mean.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">For example, if I use an unknown language in my prayers, my spirit prays but my mind is useless.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Then what should I do? There are times when I should pray with my spirit, and times when I should pray with my mind. Sometimes I should sing with my spirit, and at other times I should sing with my mind.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Suppose some strangers are in your worship service, when you are praising God with your spirit. If they don't understand you, how will they know to say, &amp;apos;Amen&amp;apos;?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">You may be worshiping God in a wonderful way, but no one else will be helped.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">I thank God that I speak unknown languages more than any of you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">But words that make sense can help the church. This is why in church I would rather speak five words that make sense than to speak 10,000 words in a language that others don't know.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">My friends, stop thinking like children. Think like mature people and be as innocent as tiny babies.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">In the Scriptures the Lord says,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Languages others don't know may mean something to unbelievers, but not to the Lord's followers. Prophecy, on the other hand, is for followers, not for unbelievers.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">Suppose everyone in your worship service started speaking unknown languages, and some outsiders or some unbelievers come in. Won't they think you are crazy?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">But suppose all of you are prophesying when those unbelievers and outsiders come in. They will realize that they are sinners, and they will want to change their ways because of what you are saying.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">They will tell what is hidden in their hearts. Then they will kneel down and say to God, &amp;apos;We are certain that you are with these people.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">My friends, when you meet to worship, you must do everything for the good of everyone there. That's how it should be when someone sings or teaches or tells what God has said or speaks an unknown language or explains what the language means.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">No more than two or three of you should speak unknown languages during the meeting. You must take turns, and someone should always be there to explain what you mean.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">If no one can explain, you must keep silent in church and speak only to yourself and to God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">Two or three persons may prophesy, and everyone else must listen carefully.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">If someone sitting there receives a message from God, the speaker must stop and let the other person speak.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">Let only one person speak at a time, then all of you will learn something and be encouraged.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">A prophet should be willing to stop and let someone else speak.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">God wants everything to be done peacefully and in order.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">the women must not be allowed to speak. They must keep quiet and listen, as the Law of Moses teaches.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">If there is something they want to know, they can ask their husbands when they get home. It is disgraceful for women to speak in church.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">God's message did not start with you people, and you are not the only ones it has reached.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">If you think of yourself as a prophet or a spiritual person, you will know I am writing only what the Lord has commanded.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">So don't pay attention to anyone who ignores what I am writing.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">My friends, be eager to prophesy and don't stop anyone from speaking languages that others don't know.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">But do everything properly and in order.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="15">
			<VERS vnumber="1">My friends, I want you to remember the message I preached and that you believed and trusted.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">You will be saved by this message, if you hold firmly to it. But if you don't, your faith was all for nothing. Christ died for our sins, as the Scriptures say. and three days later he was raised to life, as the Scriptures say. then to the twelve. to more than five hundred other followers. Most of them are still alive, but some have died. then to all of the apostles. &amp;apos;Let's eat and drink. Tomorrow we die.&amp;apos; &amp;apos;Death has lost the battle! Where is its sting?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">I told you the most important part of the message exactly as it was told to me. This part is:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">He was buried,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Christ appeared to Peter,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">After this, he appeared</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">He also appeared to James,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Finally, he appeared to me, even though I am like someone who was born at the wrong time.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">I am the least important of all the apostles. In fact, I caused so much trouble for God's church that I don't even deserve to be called an apostle.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">But God treated me with undeserved grace! He made me what I am, and his grace wasn't wasted. I worked much harder than any of the other apostles, although it was really God's grace at work and not me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">But it doesn't matter if I preached or if they preached. All of you believed the message just the same.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">If we preach that Christ was raised from death, how can some of you say the dead will not be raised to life?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">If they won't be raised to life, Christ himself wasn't raised to life.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">And if Christ wasn't raised to life, our message is worthless, and so is your faith.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">If the dead won't be raised to life, we have told lies about God by saying he raised Christ to life, when he really did not.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">So if the dead won't be raised to life, Christ wasn't raised to life.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Unless Christ was raised to life, your faith is useless, and you are still living in your sins.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">And those people who died after putting their faith in him are completely lost.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">If our hope in Christ is good only for this life, we are worse off than anyone else.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">But Christ has been raised to life! And he makes us certain that others will also be raised to life.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Just as we will die because of Adam, we will be raised to life because of Christ.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Adam brought death to all of us, and Christ will bring life to all of us.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">But we must each wait our turn. Christ was the first to be raised to life, and his people will be raised to life when he returns.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">Then after Christ has destroyed all powers and forces, the end will come, and he will give the kingdom to God the Father.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">Christ will rule until he puts all his enemies under his power,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">and the last enemy he destroys will be death.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">When the Scriptures say he will put everything under his power, they don't include God. It was God who put everything under the power of Christ.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">After everything is under the power of God's Son, he will put himself under the power of God, who put everything under his Son's power. Then God will mean everything to everyone.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">If the dead are not going to be raised to life, what will people do who are being baptized for them? Why are they being baptized for those dead people?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">And why do we always risk our lives</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">and face death every day? The pride that I have in you because of Christ Jesus our Lord is what makes me say this.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">What do you think I gained by fighting wild animals in Ephesus? If the dead are not raised to life,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">Don't fool yourselves. Bad friends will destroy you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">Be sensible and stop sinning. You should be embarrassed that some people still don't know about God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">Some of you have asked, &amp;apos;How will the dead be raised to life? What kind of bodies will they have?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">Don't be foolish. A seed must die before it can sprout from the ground.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">Wheat seeds and all other seeds look different from the sprouts that come up.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">This is because God gives everything the kind of body he wants it to have.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">People, animals, birds, and fish are each made of flesh, but none of them are alike.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">Everything in the heavens has a body, and so does everything on earth. But each one is very different from all the others.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">The sun isn't like the moon, the moon isn't like the stars, and each star is different.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">That's how it will be when our bodies are raised to life. These bodies will die, but the bodies that are raised will live forever.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43">These ugly and weak bodies will become beautiful and strong.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44">As surely as there are physical bodies, there are spiritual bodies. And our physical bodies will be changed into spiritual bodies.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45">The first man was named Adam, and the Scriptures tell us that he was a living person. But Jesus, who may be called the last Adam, is a life-giving spirit.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46">We see that the one with a spiritual body did not come first. He came after the one who had a physical body.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="47">The first man was made from the dust of the earth, but the second man came from heaven.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="48">Everyone on earth has a body like the body of the one who was made from the dust of the earth. And everyone in heaven has a body like the body of the one who came from heaven.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="49">Just as we are like the one who was made out of earth, we will be like the one who came from heaven.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="50">My friends, I want you to know that our bodies of flesh and blood will decay. This means they cannot share in God's kingdom, which lasts forever.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="51">I will explain a mystery to you. Not every one of us will die, but we will all be changed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="52">It will happen suddenly, quicker than the blink of an eye. At the sound of the last trumpet the dead will be raised. We will all be changed, so we will never die again.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="53">Our dead and decaying bodies will be changed into bodies that won't die or decay.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="54">The bodies we now have are weak and can die. But they will be changed into bodies that are eternal. Then the Scriptures will come true,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="55">Where is its victory?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="56">Sin is what gives death its sting, and the Law is the power behind sin.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="57">But thank God for letting our Lord Jesus Christ give us the victory!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="58">My dear friends, stand firm and don't be shaken. Always keep busy working for the Lord. You know that everything you do for him is worthwhile.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1">From Paul, chosen by God to be an apostle of Jesus Christ, and from Timothy, who is also a follower. To God's church in Corinth and to all of God's people in Achaia.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">I pray that God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ will be kind to you and will bless you with peace!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Praise God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ! The Father is a merciful God, who always gives us comfort.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">He comforts us when we are in trouble, so that we can share this same comfort with others in trouble.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">We share in the terrible sufferings of Christ, but also in the wonderful comfort he gives.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">We suffer in the hope that you will be comforted and saved. And because we are comforted, you will also be comforted, as you patiently endure suffering like ours.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">You never disappoint us. You suffered as much as we did, and we know that you will be comforted as we were.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">My friends, I want you to know what a hard time we had in Asia. Our sufferings were so horrible and so unbearable that death seemed certain.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">In fact, we felt sure we were going to die. But this made us stop trusting in ourselves and start trusting God, who raises the dead to life.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">God saved us from the threat of death, and we are sure that he will do it again and again.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Please help us by praying for us. Then many people will give thanks for the blessings we receive in answer to all these prayers.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">We can be proud of our clear conscience. We have always lived honestly and sincerely, especially when we were with you. And we were guided by God's gift of undeserved grace instead of by the wisdom of this world.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">I am not writing anything you cannot read and understand. I hope you will understand it completely,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">just as you already partly understand us. Then when our Lord Jesus returns, you can be as proud of us as we are of you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">I was so sure of your pride in us that I had planned to visit you first of all. In this way you would have the blessing of two visits from me&amp;ndash;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">once on my way to Macedonia and again on my return from there. Then you could send me on to Judea.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Do you think I couldn't make up my mind about what to do? Or do I seem like someone who says &amp;apos;Yes&amp;apos; or &amp;apos;No&amp;apos; simply to please others?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">God can be trusted, and so can I, when I say our answer to you has always been &amp;apos;Yes&amp;apos; and never &amp;apos;No.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">This is because Jesus Christ the Son of God is always &amp;apos;Yes&amp;apos; and never &amp;apos;No.&amp;apos; And he is the one Silas, Timothy, and I told you about.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="4">At the time I wrote, I was suffering terribly. My eyes were full of tears, and my heart was broken. But I didn't want to make you feel bad. I only wanted to let you know how much I cared for you. No one really has what it takes to do this work.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">I don't want to be hard on you. But if one of you has made someone feel bad, I am not really the one who has been made to feel bad. Some of you are the ones.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Most of you have already pointed out the wrong that person did, and this is punishment enough for what was done.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">When people sin, you should forgive and comfort them, so they won't give up in despair.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">You should make them sure of your love for them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">I also wrote because I wanted to test you and find out if you would follow my instructions.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">I will forgive anyone you forgive. Yes, for your sake and with Christ as my witness, I have forgiven whatever needed to be forgiven.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">I have done this to keep Satan from getting the better of us. We all know what goes on in his mind.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">When I went to Troas to preach the good news about Christ, I found that the Lord had already prepared the way.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">But I was worried when I didn't find my friend Titus there. So I left the other followers and went on to Macedonia.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">I am grateful that God always makes it possible for Christ to lead us to victory. God also helps us spread the knowledge about Christ everywhere, and this knowledge is like the smell of perfume.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">A lot of people try to get rich from preaching God's message. But we are God's sincere messengers, and by the power of Christ we speak our message with God as our witness.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1">Are we once again bragging about ourselves? Do we need letters to you or from you to tell others about us? Some people do need letters telling about them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">But you are our letter, and you are in our hearts for everyone to read and understand.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">You are like a letter written by Christ and delivered by us. But you are not written with pen and ink or on tablets made of stone. You are written in our hearts by the Spirit of the living God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">We are sure about all this. Christ makes us sure in the very presence of God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">We don't have the right to claim that we have done anything on our own. God gives us what it takes to do all we do.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">He makes us worthy to be the servants of his new agreement that comes from the Holy Spirit and not from a written Law. After all, the Law brings death, but the Spirit brings life.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">The Law of Moses brought only the promise of death, even though it was carved on stones and given in a wonderful way. Still the Law made Moses' face shine so brightly the people of Israel could not look at it, even though it was a fading glory.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">So won't the agreement the Spirit brings to us be even more wonderful?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">If something that brings the death sentence is glorious, won't something that makes us acceptable to God be even more glorious?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">In fact, the new agreement is so wonderful that the Law is no longer glorious at all.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">The Law was given with a glory that faded away. But the glory of the new agreement is much greater, because it will never fade away.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">This wonderful hope makes us feel like speaking freely.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">We are not like Moses. His face was shining, but he covered it to keep the people of Israel from seeing the brightness fade away.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">The people were stubborn, and something still keeps them from seeing the truth when the Law is read. Only Christ can take away the covering that keeps them from seeing.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">When the Law of Moses is read, they have their minds covered over</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">with a covering that is removed only for those who turn to the Lord.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">The Lord and the Spirit are one and the same, and the Lord's Spirit sets us free.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">So our faces are not covered. They show the bright glory of the Lord, as the Lord's Spirit makes us more and more like our glorious Lord.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1">God has been kind enough to trust us with this work. This is why we never give up.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">We don't do shameful things that must be kept secret. And we don't try to fool anyone or twist God's message around. God is our witness that we speak only the truth, so others will be sure we can be trusted.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">If there is anything hidden about our message, it is hidden only to someone who is lost.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">The god who rules this world has blinded the minds of unbelievers. They cannot see the light, which is the good news about our glorious Christ, who shows what God is like.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">We are not preaching about ourselves. Our message is that Jesus Christ is Lord. He also sent us to be your servants.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">The Scriptures say, &amp;apos;God commanded light to shine in the dark.&amp;apos; Now God is shining in our hearts to let you know that his glory is seen in Jesus Christ.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">We are like clay jars in which this treasure is stored. The real power comes from God and not from us.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">We often suffer, but we are never crushed. Even when we don't know what to do, we never give up.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">In times of trouble, God is with us, and when we are knocked down, we get up again.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">This means that death is working in us, but life is working in you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">In the Scriptures it says, &amp;apos;I spoke because I had faith.&amp;apos; We have this same kind of faith. So we speak</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">because we know that God raised the Lord Jesus to life. And just as God raised Jesus, he will also raise us to life. Then he will bring us into his presence together with you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">All of this has been done for you, so more and more people will know how kind God is and will praise and honor him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">We never give up. Our bodies are gradually dying, but we ourselves are being made stronger each day.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">These little troubles are getting us ready for an eternal glory that will make all our troubles seem like nothing.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Things that are seen don't last forever, but things that are not seen are eternal. This is why we keep our minds on the things that cannot be seen.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="5">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Our bodies are like tents that we live in here on earth. But when these tents are destroyed, we know that God will give each of us a place to live. These homes will not be buildings someone has made, but they are in heaven and will last forever.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">While we are here on earth, we sigh because we want to live in that heavenly home.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">We want to put it on like clothes and not be naked. As long as we are in these bodies, we are away from the Lord.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">These tents we now live in are like a heavy burden, and we groan. But we don't do this just because we want to leave these bodies that will die. It is because we want to change them for bodies that will never die.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">God is the one who makes all this possible. He has given us his Spirit to make us certain he will do it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">So always be cheerful!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">But we live by faith, not by what we see.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">We should be cheerful, because we would rather leave these bodies and be at home with the Lord.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">But whether we are at home with the Lord or away from him, we still try our best to please him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">After all, Christ will judge each of us for the good or the bad that we do while living in these bodies.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">We know what it means to respect the Lord, and we encourage everyone to turn to him. God himself knows what we are like, and I hope you also know what kind of people we are.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">We are not trying once more to brag about ourselves. But we want you to be proud of us, when you are with those who are not sincere and brag about what others think of them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">If we seem out of our minds, it is between God and us. But if we are in our right minds, it is for your good.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">We are ruled by Christ's love for us. We are certain that if one person died for everyone else, then all of us have died.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">And Christ did die for all of us. He died so we would no longer live for ourselves, but for the one who died and was raised to life for us.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">We are careful not to judge people by what they seem to be, though we once judged Christ in this way.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Anyone who belongs to Christ is a new person. The past is forgotten, and everything is new.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">God has done it all! He sent Christ to make peace between himself and us, and he has given us the work of making peace between himself and others.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">What we mean is that God was in Christ, offering peace and forgiveness to the people of this world. And he has given us the work of sharing his message about peace.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">We were sent to speak for Christ, and God is begging you to listen to our message. We speak for Christ and sincerely ask you to make peace with God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Christ never sinned! But God treated him as a sinner, so Christ could make us acceptable to God.</VERS>

This is the day for you to be saved. &amp;apos;I will live with these people and walk among them. I will be their God, and they will be my people.&amp;apos; &amp;apos;Leave them and stay away! Don't touch anything that isn't clean. Then I will welcome you You will be my sons and my daughters, as surely as I am God, the All-Powerful.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">We don't want anyone to find fault with our work, and so we try hard not to cause problems.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">But in everything and in every way we show we truly are God's servants. We have always been patient, though we have had a lot of trouble, suffering, and hard times.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">We have been beaten, put in jail, and hurt in riots. We have worked hard and have gone without sleep or food.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">But we have kept ourselves pure and have been understanding, patient, and kind. The Holy Spirit has been with us, and our love has been real.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">We have spoken the truth, and God's power has worked in us. In all our struggles we have said and done only what is right.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Whether we were honored or dishonored or praised or cursed, we always told the truth about ourselves. But some people said we did not.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">We are unknown to others, but well known to you. We seem to be dying, and yet we are still alive. We have been punished, but never killed,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">and we are always happy, even in times of suffering. Although we are poor, we have made many people rich. And though we own nothing, everything is ours.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Friends in Corinth, we are telling the truth when we say there is room in our hearts for you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">We are not holding back on our love for you, but you are holding back on your love for us.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">I speak to you as I would speak to my own children. Please make room in your hearts for us.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Stay away from people who are not followers of the Lord! Can someone who is good get along with someone who is evil? Are light and darkness the same?</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="7">
			<VERS vnumber="1">My friends, God has made us these promises. So we should stay away from everything that keeps our bodies and spirits from being clean. We should honor God and try to be completely like him. Although we were encouraged, we felt even better when we saw how happy Titus was, because you had shown he had nothing to worry about.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Make a place for us in your hearts! We haven't mistreated or hurt anyone. We haven't cheated anyone.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">I am not saying this to be hard on you. But, as I have said before, you will always be in our thoughts, whether we live or die.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">I trust you completely. I am always proud of you, and I am greatly encouraged. In all my trouble I am still very happy.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">After we came to Macedonia, we didn't have any chance to rest. We were faced with all kinds of problems. We were troubled by enemies and troubled by fears.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">But God cheers up people in need, and this is what he did when he sent Titus to us.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Of course, we were glad to see Titus, but what really made us glad is the way you cheered him up. He told how sorry you were and how concerned you were about me. And this made me even happier.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">I don't feel bad anymore, even though my letter hurt your feelings. I did feel bad at first, but I don't now. I know that the letter hurt you for a while.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Now I am happy, but not because I hurt your feelings. It is because God used your hurt feelings to make you turn back to him, and none of you were harmed by us.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">When God makes you feel sorry enough to turn to him and be saved, you don't have anything to feel bad about. But when this world makes you feel sorry, it can cause your death.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Just look what God has done by making you feel sorry! You sincerely want to prove you are innocent. You are angry. You are shocked. You are eager to see that justice is done. You have proved that you were completely right in this matter.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">When I wrote you, it wasn't to accuse the one who was wrong or to take up for the one who was hurt. I wrote, so God would show you how much you do care for us.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">And we were greatly encouraged.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">We had told him how much we thought of you, and you did not disappoint us. Just as we have always told you the truth, so everything we told him about you has also proved to be true.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Titus loves all of you very much, especially when he remembers how you obeyed him and how you trembled with fear when you welcomed him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">It makes me really glad to know I can depend on you.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="8">
			<VERS vnumber="1">My friends, we want you to know that the churches in Macedonia have shown others God's gift of undeserved grace.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Although they were going through hard times and were very poor, they were glad to give generously.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">They gave as much as they could afford and even more, simply because they wanted to.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">They even asked and begged us to let them have the joy of giving their money for God's people.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">And they did more than we had hoped. They gave themselves first to the Lord and then to us, just as God wanted them to do. &amp;apos;Those who gathered too much had nothing left. Those who gathered only a little had all they needed.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Titus was the one who got you started doing this good thing, so we begged him to help you finish what you had begun.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">You do everything better than anyone else. You have stronger faith. You speak better and know more. You are eager to give, and you love us better. Now you must give more generously than anyone else.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">I am not ordering you to do this. I am simply testing how real your love is by comparing it with the concern that others have shown.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">You know our Lord Jesus Christ treated us with undeserved grace by giving up all his riches, so you could become rich.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">A year ago you were the first ones to give, and you gave because you wanted to. So listen to my advice.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">I think you should finish what you started. If you give according to what you have, you will prove you are as eager to give as you were to think about giving.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">It doesn't matter how much you have. What matters is how much you are willing to give from what you have.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">I am not trying to make life easier for others by making life harder for you. But it is only fair</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">for you to share with them when you have so much, and they have so little. Later, when they have more than enough, and you are in need, they can share with you. Then everyone will have a fair share,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">just as the Scriptures say,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">I am grateful that God made Titus care as much about you as we do.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">When we begged Titus to visit you, he said he would. He wanted to because he cared so much for you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">With Titus we are also sending one of the Lord's followers who is well known in every church for spreading the good news.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">The churches chose this follower to travel with us while we carry this gift that will bring praise to the Lord and show how much we hope to help.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">We don't want anyone to find fault with the way we handle your generous gift.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">But we want to do what pleases the Lord and what people think is right.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">We are also sending someone else with Titus and the other follower. We approve of this man. In fact, he has already shown us many times that he wants to help. And now he wants to help even more than ever, because he trusts you so much.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">Titus is my partner, who works with me to serve you. The other two followers are sent by the churches, and they bring honor to Christ.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">Treat them in such a way that the churches will see your love and will know why we bragged about you.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="9">
			<VERS vnumber="1">I don't need to write you about the money you plan to give for God's people.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">I know how eager you are to give. And I have proudly told the Lord's followers in Macedonia that you people in Achaia have been ready for a whole year. Now your desire to give has made them want to give.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">This is why I am sending Titus and the two others to you. I want you to be ready, just as I promised. This will prove we were not wrong to brag about you. &amp;apos;A few seeds make a small harvest, but a lot of seeds make a big harvest.&amp;apos; &amp;apos;God freely gives his gifts to the poor, and always does right.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Some followers from Macedonia may come with me, and I want them to find that you have the money ready. If you don't, I would be embarrassed for trusting you to do this. But you would be embarrassed even more.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">So I have decided to ask Titus and the others to spend some time with you before I arrive. This way they can arrange to collect the money you have promised. Then you will have the chance to give because you want to, and not because you feel forced to.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Remember this saying,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Each of you must make up your own mind about how much to give. But don't feel sorry that you must give and don't feel you are forced to give. God loves people who love to give.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">God can bless you with everything you need, and you will always have more than enough to do all kinds of good things for others.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">The Scriptures say,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">God gives seed to farmers and provides everyone with food. He will increase what you have, so you can give even more to those in need.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">You will be blessed in every way, and you will be able to keep on being generous. Then many people will thank God when we deliver your gift.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">What you are doing is much more than a service that supplies God's people with what they need. It is something that will make many others thank God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">The way in which you have proved yourselves by this service will bring honor and praise to God. You believed the message about Christ, and you obeyed it by sharing generously with God's people and with everyone else.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Now they are praying for you and want to see you, because God used you to bless them so very much.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Thank God for his gift that is too wonderful for words!</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="10">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Do you think I am a coward when I am with you and brave when I am far away? Well, I ask you to listen, because Christ himself was humble and gentle.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Some people have said we act like the people of this world. So when I arrive, I expect I will have to be firm and forceful in what I say to them. Please don't make me treat you that way.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">We live in this world, but we don't act like its people</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">or fight our battles with the weapons of this world. Instead, we use God's power that can destroy fortresses. We destroy arguments</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">and every bit of pride that keeps anyone from knowing God. We capture people's thoughts and make them obey Christ.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">And when you completely obey him, we will punish anyone who refuses to obey.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">You judge by appearances. If any of you think you are the only ones who belong to Christ, then think again. We belong to Christ as much as you do.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Maybe I brag a little too much about the authority that the Lord gave me to help you and not to hurt you. Yet I am not embarrassed to brag.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">And I am not trying to scare you with my letters.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Some of you are saying, &amp;apos;Paul's letters are harsh and powerful. But in person, he is a weakling and has nothing worth saying.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Those people had better understand that when I am with you, I will do exactly what I say in my letters.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">We won't dare compare ourselves with those who think so much of themselves. But they are foolish to compare themselves with themselves.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">We won't brag about something we don't have a right to brag about. We will only brag about the work God has sent us to do, and you are part of that work.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">We are not bragging more than we should. After all, we did bring the message about Christ to you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">We don't brag about what others have done, as if we had done those things ourselves. But I hope as you become stronger in your faith, we will be able to reach many more of the people around you. That has always been our goal.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Then we will be able to preach the good news in other lands where we cannot take credit for work someone else has already done.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">The Scriptures say, &amp;apos;If you want to brag, then brag about the Lord.&amp;apos;</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="4">We told you about Jesus, and you received the Holy Spirit and accepted our message. But you let some people tell you about another Jesus. Now you are ready to receive another spirit and accept a different message.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">I think I am as good as any of those super apostles.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">I may not speak as well as they do, but I know as much. And this has already been made perfectly clear to you. If they can brag, so can I, but it is a foolish thing to do.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="10">As surely as I speak the truth about Christ, no one in Achaia can stop me from bragging about this.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">And it isn't because I don't love you. God himself knows how much I do love you.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="13">Anyway, they are no more than false apostles and dishonest workers. They only pretend to be apostles of Christ.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">And it is no wonder. Even Satan tries to make himself look like an angel of light.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">So why does it seem strange for Satan's servants to pretend to do what is right? Someday they will get exactly what they deserve.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">I don't want any of you to think I am a fool. But if you do, then let me be a fool and brag a little.</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="12">
			<VERS vnumber="1">I have to brag. There is nothing to be gained by it, but I must brag about the visions and other things that the Lord has shown me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">I know about one of Christ's followers who was taken up into the third heaven 14 years ago. I don't know if the man was still in his body when it happened, but God certainly knows.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">As I said, only God really knows if this man was in his body at the time.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">But he was taken up into paradise, where he heard things too wonderful to tell.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">I will brag about that man, but not about myself, except to say how weak I am.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Yet even if I did brag, I would not be foolish. I would simply be speaking the truth. But I will try not to say too much. That way, none of you will think more highly of me than you should because of what you have seen me do and say.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Of course, I am now referring to the wonderful things I saw. One of Satan's angels was sent to make me suffer terribly, so that I would not feel too proud.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Three times I begged the Lord to make this suffering go away.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">But he replied, &amp;apos;My gift of undeserved grace is all you need. My power is strongest when you are weak.&amp;apos; So if Christ keeps giving me his power, I will gladly brag about how weak I am.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Yes, I am glad to be weak or insulted or mistreated or to have troubles and sufferings, if it is for Christ. Because when I am weak, I am strong.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">I have been making a fool of myself. But you forced me to do it, when you should have been speaking up for me. I may be nothing at all, but I am as good as those super apostles.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">When I was with you, I was patient and worked all the powerful miracles and signs and wonders of a true apostle.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">You missed out on only one blessing the other churches received. That is, you didn't have to support me. Forgive me for doing you wrong.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">I am planning to visit you for the third time. But I still won't make a burden of myself. What I really want is you, and not what you have. Children are not supposed to save up for their parents, but parents are supposed to take care of their children.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">So I will gladly give all I have and all I am. Will you love me less for loving you too much?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">You agree that I wasn't a burden to you. Maybe that's because I was trying to catch you off guard and trick you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Were you cheated by any of those I sent to you?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">I urged Titus to visit you, and I sent another follower with him. But Titus didn't cheat you, and we felt and behaved the same way he did.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Have you been thinking all along that we have been defending ourselves to you? Actually, we have been speaking to God as followers of Christ. But, my friends, we did it all for your good.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">I am afraid when I come, we won't be pleased with each other. I fear that some of you may be arguing or jealous or angry or selfish or gossiping or insulting each other. I even fear that you may be proud and acting like a mob.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">I am afraid God will make me ashamed when I visit you again. I will feel like crying because many of you have never given up your old sins. You are still doing things that are immoral, indecent, and shameful.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="13">
			<VERS vnumber="1">I am on my way to visit you for the third time. And as the Scriptures say, &amp;apos;Any charges must be proved true by at least two or three witnesses.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">During my second visit I warned you that I would punish you and anyone else who doesn't stop sinning. I am far away from you now, but I give you the same warning.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">This should prove to you that I am speaking for Christ. When he corrects you, he won't be weak. He will be powerful!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Although he was weak when he was nailed to the cross, he now lives by the power of God. We are weak, just as Christ was. But you will see that we will live by the power of God, just as Christ does. Now I pray that God, who gives love and peace, will be with you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Test yourselves and find out if you really are true to your faith. If you pass the test, you will discover that Christ is living in you. But if Christ isn't living in you, you have failed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">I hope you will discover we have not failed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">We pray you will stop doing evil things. We don't pray like this to make ourselves look good, but to get you to do right, even if we are failures.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">All we can do is to follow the truth and not fight against it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Even though we are weak, we are glad that you are strong, and we pray you will do even better.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">I am writing these things to you before I arrive. This way I won't have to be hard on you when I use the authority the Lord has given me. I was given this authority, so I could help you and not destroy you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Goodbye, my friends. Do better and pay attention to what I have said. Try to get along and live peacefully with each other.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Give each other a warm greeting. All God's people send their greetings.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">I pray that the Lord Jesus Christ will bless you and be kind to you! May God bless you with his love, and may the Holy Spirit join all your hearts together.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="6">I am shocked that you have so quickly turned from God, who chose you with his gift of undeserved grace. You have believed another message,</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="8">I pray that God will punish anyone who preaches anything different from our message to you! It doesn't matter if that person is one of us or an angel from heaven.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">I have said it before, and I will say it again. I hope God will punish anyone who preaches anything different from what you have already believed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">I am not trying to please people. I want to please God. Do you think I am trying to please people? If I were doing that, I would not be a servant of Christ.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">My friends, I want you to know that no one made up the message I preach.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">It wasn't given or taught to me by some mere human. My message came directly from Jesus Christ when he appeared to me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">You know how I used to live as a Jew. I was cruel to God's church and even tried to destroy it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">I was a much better Jew than anyone else my own age, and I obeyed every law our ancestors had given us.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">But even before I was born, God had chosen me by his gift of undeserved grace and had decided</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">to show me his Son, so I would announce his message to the Gentiles. I didn't talk this over with anyone.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">I didn't say a word, not even to the men in Jerusalem who were apostles before I was. Instead, I went at once to Arabia, and afterwards I returned to Damascus.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="19">The only other apostle I saw was James, the Lord's brother.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="23">They had only heard that the one who had been cruel to them was now preaching the message that he had once tried to destroy.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">And because of me, they praised God.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="2">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Fourteen years later I went to Jerusalem with Barnabas. I also took along Titus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">But I went there because God had told me to go, and I explained the good news I had been preaching to the Gentiles. Then I met privately with the ones who seemed to be the most important leaders. I wanted to make sure my work in the past and my future work would not be for nothing. Peter, you are a Jew, but you live like a Gentile. So how can you force Gentiles to live like Jews? I have been nailed to the cross with Christ.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Titus went to Jerusalem with me. He was a Greek, but still he wasn't forced to be circumcised.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">We went there because of those who pretended to be followers and had sneaked in among us as spies. They had come to take away the freedom Christ Jesus had given us, and they were trying to make us their slaves.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">But we wanted you to have the true message. This is why we didn't give in to them, not even for a second.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Some of them were supposed to be important leaders, but I didn't care who they were. God doesn't have any favorites! None of these so-called special leaders added anything to my message.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">They realized God had sent me with the good news for Gentiles, and he had sent Peter with the same message for Jews.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">God, who had sent Peter on a mission to the Jews, was now using me to preach to the Gentiles.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">James, Peter, and John realized that God had given me the message about his gift of undeserved grace. And these men are supposed to be the backbone of the church. They even gave Barnabas and me a friendly handshake. This was to show that we would work with Gentiles and that they would work with Jews.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">They only asked us to remember the poor, and this was something I had always been eager to do.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">When Peter came to Antioch, I told him face to face that he was wrong.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">He used to eat with Gentile followers of the Lord, until James sent some Jewish followers. Peter was afraid of the Jews and soon stopped eating with Gentiles.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">He and the others hid their true feelings so well that even Barnabas was fooled.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">But when I saw they were not really obeying the truth that is in the good news, I corrected Peter in front of everyone and said:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">We are Jews by birth and are not sinners like Gentiles.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">But we know that God accepts only those who have faith in Jesus Christ. No one can please God by simply obeying the Law. So we put our faith in Christ Jesus, and God accepted us because of our faith.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">When we Jews started looking for a way to please God, we discovered that we are sinners too. Does this mean that Christ is the one who makes us sinners? No, it doesn't!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">But if I tear down something and then build it again, I prove that I was wrong at first.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">It was the Law itself that killed me and freed me from its power, so I could live for God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">I have died, but Christ lives in me. And I now live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave his life for me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">I don't turn my back on God's gift of undeserved grace. If we can be acceptable to God by obeying the Law, it was useless for Christ to die.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="3">
			<VERS vnumber="1">You stupid Galatians! I told you exactly how Jesus Christ was nailed to a cross. Has someone now put an evil spell on you?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">I want to know only one thing. How were you given God's Spirit? Was it by obeying the Law of Moses or by hearing about Christ and having faith in him?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">How can you be so stupid? Do you think that by yourself you can complete what God's Spirit started in you?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Have you gone through all of this for nothing? Is it all really for nothing?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">God gives you his Spirit and works miracles in you. But does he do this because you obey the Law of Moses or because you have heard about Christ and have faith in him?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">The Scriptures say that God accepted Abraham because Abraham had faith.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">And so, you should understand that everyone who has faith is a child of Abraham.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Long ago the Scriptures said God would accept the Gentiles because of their faith. This is why God told Abraham the good news that all nations would be blessed because of him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">This means everyone who has faith will share in the blessings given to Abraham because of his faith.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Anyone who tries to please God by obeying the Law is under a curse. The Scriptures say, &amp;apos;Everyone who doesn't obey everything in the Law is under a curse.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">No one can please God by obeying the Law. The Scriptures also say, &amp;apos;The people God accepts because of their faith will live.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">The Law isn't based on faith. It promises life only to people who obey its commands.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">But Christ rescued us from the Law's curse, when he became a curse in our place. This is because the Scriptures say that anyone who is nailed to a tree is under a curse.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">And because of what Jesus Christ has done, the blessing promised to Abraham was taken to the Gentiles. This happened so that by faith we would be given the promised Holy Spirit.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">My friends, I will use an everyday example to explain what I mean. Once someone agrees to something, no one else can change or cancel the agreement.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">That is how it is with the promises God made to Abraham and his descendant. The promises were not made to many descendants, but only to one, and that one is Christ.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">What I am saying is that the Law cannot change or cancel God's promise made 430 years before the Law was given.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">If we have to obey the Law in order to receive God's blessings, those blessings don't really come to us because of God's promise. But God was kind to Abraham and made him a promise.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">What is the use of the Law? It was given later to show that we sin. But it was only supposed to last until the coming of that descendant who was given the promise. In fact, angels gave the Law to Moses, and he gave it to the people.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">There is only one God, and the Law did not come directly from him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Does the Law disagree with God's promises? No, it doesn't! If any law could give life to us, we could become acceptable to God by obeying that law.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">But the Scriptures say that sin controls everyone, so that God's promises will be for anyone who has faith in Jesus Christ.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">The Law controlled us and kept us under its power until the time came when we would have faith.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">In fact, the Law was to be our teacher until Christ came. Then we could have faith and be acceptable to God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">But once a person has learned to have faith, there is no more need to have the Law as a teacher.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">All of you are God's children because of your faith in Christ Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">And when you were baptized, it was as though you had put on Christ in the same way you put on new clothes.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">Faith in Christ Jesus is what makes each of you equal with each other, whether you are a Jew or a Greek, a slave or a free person, a man or a woman.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">So if you belong to Christ, you are now part of Abraham's family, and you will be given what God has promised.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="4">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Children who are under age are no better off than slaves, even though everything their parents own will someday be theirs.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">This is because children are placed in the care of guardians and teachers until the time their parents have set.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">This is how it was with us. We were like children ruled by the powers of this world. &amp;apos;You have never had children, but now you can be glad. You have never given birth, but now you can shout. Once you had no children, but now you will have more children than a woman who has been married for a long time.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">But when the time was right, God sent his Son, and a woman gave birth to him. His Son obeyed the Law,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">so he could set us free from the Law, and we could become God's children.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Now that we are his children, God has sent the Spirit of his Son into our hearts. And his Spirit tells us that God is our Father.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">You are no longer slaves. You are God's children, and you will be given what he has promised.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Before you knew God, you were slaves of gods that are not real.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">But now you know God, or better still, God knows you. How can you turn back and become the slaves of those weak and pitiful powers?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">You even celebrate certain days, months, seasons, and years.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">I am afraid I have wasted my time working with you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">My friends, I beg you to be like me, just as I once tried to be like you. Did you mistreat me</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">when I first preached to you? No you didn't, even though you knew I had come there because I was sick.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">My illness must have caused you some trouble, but you didn't hate me or turn me away because of it. You welcomed me as though I were one of God's angels or even Christ Jesus himself.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Where is that good feeling now? I am sure if it had been possible, you would have taken out your own eyes and given them to me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Am I now your enemy, just because I told you the truth?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Those people may be paying you a lot of attention, but it isn't for your good. They only want to keep you away from me, so you will pay them a lot of attention.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">It is always good to give your attention to something worthwhile, even when I am not with you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">My children, I am in terrible pain until Christ may be seen living in you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">I wish I were with you now. Then I would not have to talk this way. You really have me puzzled.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Some of you would like to be under the rule of the Law of Moses. But do you know what the Law says?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">In the Scriptures we learn that Abraham had two sons. The mother of one of them was a slave, while the mother of the other one had always been free.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">The son of the slave woman was born in the usual way. But the son of the free woman was born because of God's promise.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">All of this has another meaning as well. Each of the two women stands for one of the agreements God made with his people. Hagar, the slave woman, stands for the agreement that was made at Mount Sinai. Everyone born into her family is a slave.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">Hagar also stands for Mount Sinai in Arabia and for the present city of Jerusalem. She and her children are slaves.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">But our mother is the city of Jerusalem in heaven above, and she isn't a slave.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">The Scriptures say about her,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">My friends, you were born because of this promise, just as Isaac was.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">But the child who was born in the natural way made trouble for the child who was born because of the Spirit. The same thing is happening today.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">The Scriptures say, &amp;apos;Get rid of the slave woman and her son! He won't be given anything. The son of the free woman will receive everything.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">My friends, we are children of the free woman and not of the slave.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="5">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Christ has set us free! This means we are really free. Now hold on to your freedom and don't ever become slaves of the Law again.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">I, Paul, promise you that Christ won't do you any good if you get circumcised.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">If you do, you must obey the whole Law.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">And if you try to please God by obeying the Law, you have cut yourself off from Christ and his gift of undeserved grace.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">But the Spirit makes us sure God will accept us because of our faith in Christ.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">If you are a follower of Christ Jesus, it makes no difference whether you are circumcised or not. All that matters is your faith that makes you love others.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">You were doing so well until someone made you turn from the truth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">And that person was certainly not sent by the one who chose you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">A little yeast can change a whole batch of dough,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">but you belong to the Lord. This makes me certain you will do what I say, instead of what someone else tells you to do. Whoever is causing trouble for you will be punished.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">My friends, if I still preach that people need to be circumcised, why am I in so much trouble? The message about the cross would no longer be a problem, if I told people to be circumcised.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">I wish everyone who is upsetting you would not only get circumcised, but would cut off much more!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">My friends, you were chosen to be free. So don't use your freedom as an excuse to do anything you want. Use it as an opportunity to serve each other with love.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">All the Law says can be summed up in the command to love others as much as you love yourself.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">But if you keep attacking each other like wild animals, you had better watch out or you will destroy yourselves.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">If you are guided by the Spirit, you won't obey your selfish desires.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">The Spirit and your desires are enemies of each other. They are always fighting each other and keeping you from doing what you feel you should.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">But if you obey the Spirit, the Law of Moses has no control over you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">People's desires make them give in to immoral ways, filthy thoughts, and shameful deeds.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">They worship idols, practice witchcraft, hate others, and are hard to get along with. People become jealous, angry, and selfish. They not only argue and cause trouble, but they are</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">envious. They get drunk, carry on at wild parties, and do other evil things as well. I told you before, and I am telling you again: No one who does these things will share in the blessings of God's kingdom.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">God's Spirit makes us loving, happy, peaceful, patient, kind, good, faithful,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">gentle, and self-controlled. There is no law against behaving in any of these ways.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">And because we belong to Christ Jesus, we have killed our selfish feelings and desires.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">God's Spirit has given us life, and so we should follow the Spirit.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">But don't be conceited or make others jealous by claiming to be better than they are.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="6">
			<VERS vnumber="1">My friends, you are spiritual. So if someone is trapped in sin, you should gently lead that person back to the right path. But watch out, and don't be tempted yourself.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">You obey the law of Christ when you offer each other a helping hand.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">If you think you are better than others, when you really aren't, you are wrong.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Do your own work well, and then you will have something to be proud of. But don't compare yourself with others.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="11">You can see what big letters I make when I write with my own hand.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Those people who are telling you to get circumcised are only trying to show how important they are. And they don't want to get into trouble for preaching about the cross of Christ.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">They are circumcised, but they don't obey the Law of Moses. All they want is to brag about having you circumcised.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">But I will never brag about anything except the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ. Because of his cross, the world is dead as far as I am concerned, and I am dead as far as the world is concerned.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">It doesn't matter if you are circumcised or not. All that matters is that you are a new person.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="16">So I never stop being grateful for you, as I mention you in my prayers.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">I ask the glorious Father and God of our Lord Jesus Christ to give you his Spirit. The Spirit will make you wise and let you understand what it means to know God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">My prayer is that light will flood your hearts and you will understand the hope given to you when God chose you. Then you will discover the glorious blessings that will be yours together with all God's people.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">I want you to know about the great and mighty power that God has for us followers. It is the same wonderful power he used</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">when he raised Christ from death and let him sit at his right side in heaven.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">There Christ rules over all forces, authorities, powers, and rulers. He rules over all beings in this world and will rule in the future world as well.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">God has put all things under the power of Christ, and for the good of the church he has made him the head of everything.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">The church is the body of Christ and is filled with Christ who completely fills everything.</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="2">
			<VERS vnumber="1">In the past you were dead because you sinned and fought against God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">You followed the ways of this world and obeyed the devil. He rules the world, and his spirit has power over everyone who doesn't obey God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Once we were also ruled by the selfish desires of our bodies and minds. We had made God angry, and we were going to be punished like everyone else.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">God raised us from death to life with Christ Jesus, and he has given us a place beside Christ in heaven.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">God did this so in the future world he could show how truly good and kind he is to us because of what Christ Jesus has done.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">You were saved by faith in God, who treats us much better than we deserve. This is God's gift to you, and not anything you have done on your own.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">It isn't something you have earned, so there is nothing you can brag about.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">God planned for us to do good things and to live as he has always wanted us to live. This is why he sent Christ to make us what we are.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Don't forget that you are Gentiles. In fact, you used to be called &amp;apos;uncircumcised&amp;apos; by those who take pride in being circumcised.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">At that time you did not know about Christ. You were foreigners to the people of Israel, and you had no part in the promises God had made to them. You were living in this world without hope and without God,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">and you were far from God. But Christ offered his life's blood as a sacrifice and brought you near God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Christ has made peace between Jews and Gentiles, and he has united us by breaking down the wall of hatred that separated us. Christ gave his own body</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">to destroy the Law of Moses with all its rules and commands. He even brought Jews and Gentiles together as though we were only one person, when he united us in peace.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">On the cross Christ did away with our hatred for each other. He also made peace between us and God by uniting Jews and Gentiles in one body.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Christ came and preached peace to you Gentiles, who were far from God, and peace to us Jews, who were near God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">And because of Christ, all of us can come to the Father by the same Spirit.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">You Gentiles are no longer strangers and foreigners. You are citizens with everyone else who belongs to the family of God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">You are like a building with the apostles and prophets as the foundation and with Christ as the most important stone.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Christ is the one who holds the building together and makes it grow into a holy temple for the Lord.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">And you are part of that building Christ has built as a place for God's own Spirit to live.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="3">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Christ Jesus made me his prisoner, so I could help you Gentiles.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">You have surely heard about God's gift of undeserved grace in choosing me to help you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">In fact, this letter tells you a little about how God has shown me his mysterious ways.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">As you read the letter, you will also find out how well I really do understand the mystery about Christ.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">No one knew about this mystery until God's Spirit told it to his holy apostles and prophets.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">And the mystery is this: Because of Christ Jesus, the good news has given the Gentiles a share in the promises God gave to the Jews. God has also let the Gentiles be part of the same body.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">God treated me with kindness. His power worked in me, and it became my job to spread the good news.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">I am the least important of all God's people. But God was kind and chose me to tell the Gentiles that because of Christ there are blessings that cannot be measured.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">God, who created everything, wanted me to help everyone understand the mysterious plan that had always been hidden in his mind.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Then God would use the church to show the powers and authorities in the spiritual world that he has many different kinds of wisdom.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">God did this according to his eternal plan. And he was able to do what he had planned because of all Christ Jesus our Lord had done.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Christ now gives us courage and confidence, so we can come to God by faith.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">This is why you should not be discouraged when I suffer for you. After all, it will bring honor to you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">I kneel in prayer to the Father.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">All beings in heaven and on earth receive their life from him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">God is wonderful and glorious. I pray that his Spirit will make you become strong followers</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">and that Christ will live in your hearts because of your faith. Stand firm and be deeply rooted in his love.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">I pray that you and all God's people will understand what is called wide or long or high or deep.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">I want you to know all about Christ's love, although it is too wonderful to be measured. Then your lives will be filled with all that God is.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1">As a prisoner of the Lord, I beg you to live in a way that is worthy of the people God has chosen to be his own.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Always be humble and gentle. Patiently put up with each other and love each other.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Try your best to let God's Spirit keep your hearts united. Do this by living at peace.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">All of you are part of the same body. There is only one Spirit of God, just as you were given one hope when you were chosen to be God's people.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">We have only one Lord, one faith, and one baptism.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">There is one God who is the Father of all people. Not only is God above all others, but he works by using all of us, and he lives in all of us. &amp;apos;When he went up to the highest place, he led away many prisoners and gave gifts to people.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Christ has generously divided out his gifts to us.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">As the Scriptures say,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">When it says, &amp;apos;he went up,&amp;apos; it means that Christ had been deep in the earth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">This also means that the one who went deep into the earth is the same one who went into the highest heaven, so he would fill the whole universe.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Christ chose some of us to be apostles, prophets, missionaries, pastors, and teachers,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">so his people would learn to serve and his body would grow strong.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">This will continue until we are united by our faith and by our understanding of the Son of God. Then we will be mature, just as Christ is, and we will be completely like him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">We must stop acting like children. We must not let deceitful people trick us by their false teachings, which are like winds that toss us around from place to place.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Love should always make us tell the truth. Then we will grow in every way and be more like Christ, the head</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">of the body. Christ holds it together and makes all of its parts work perfectly, as it grows and becomes strong because of love.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">As a follower of the Lord, I order you to stop living like stupid, godless people.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Their minds are in the dark, and they are stubborn and ignorant and have missed out on the life that comes from God. They no longer have any feelings about what is right,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">and they are so greedy they do all kinds of indecent things.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">You were told that your foolish desires will destroy you and that you must give up your old way of life with all its bad habits.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">Let the Spirit change your way of thinking</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">and make you into a new person. You were created to be like God, and so you must please him and be truly holy.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">We are part of the same body. Stop lying and start telling each other the truth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">Don't get so angry that you sin. Don't go to bed angry</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">and don't give the devil a chance.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">If you are a thief, quit stealing. Be honest and work hard, so you will have something to give to people in need.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">Stop all your dirty talk. Say the right thing at the right time and help others by what you say.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">Don't make God's Spirit sad. The Spirit makes you sure that someday you will be free from your sins.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">Stop being bitter and angry and mad at others. Don't yell at one another or curse each other or ever be rude.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">Instead, be kind and merciful, and forgive others, just as God forgave you because of Christ.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="5">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Do as God does. After all, you are his dear children.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Let love be your guide. Christ loved us and offered his life for us as a sacrifice that pleases God. &amp;apos;Wake up from your sleep and rise from death. Then Christ will shine on you.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">You are God's people, so don't let it be said that any of you are immoral or indecent or greedy.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Don't use dirty or foolish or filthy words. Instead, say how thankful you are.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Being greedy, indecent, or immoral is just another way of worshiping idols. You can be sure people who behave in this way will never be part of the kingdom that belongs to Christ and to God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Don't let anyone trick you with foolish talk. God punishes everyone who disobeys him and says foolish things.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">So don't have anything to do with anyone like that.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">You used to be like people living in the dark, but now you are people of the light because you belong to the Lord. So act like people of the light</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">and make your light shine. Be good and honest and truthful,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">as you try to please the Lord.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Don't take part in doing those worthless things that are done in the dark. Instead, show how wrong they are.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">It is disgusting even to talk about what is done in the dark.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">But the light will show what these things are really like.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Light shows up everything, just as the Scriptures say,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Act like people with good sense and not like fools.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">These are evil times, so make every minute count.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Don't be stupid. Instead, find out what the Lord wants you to do.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Don't destroy yourself by getting drunk, but let the Spirit fill your life.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">When you meet together, sing psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs, as you praise the Lord with all your heart.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Always use the name of our Lord Jesus Christ to thank God the Father for everything.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Honor Christ and put others first.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">A wife should put her husband first, as she does the Lord.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">A husband is the head of his wife, as Christ is the head and the Savior of the church, which is his own body.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">Wives should always put their husbands first, as the church puts Christ first.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">A husband should love his wife as much as Christ loved the church and gave his life for it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">He made the church holy by the power of his word, and he made it pure by washing it with water.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">Christ did this, so he would have a glorious and holy church, without faults or spots or wrinkles or any other flaws.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">In the same way, a husband should love his wife as much as he loves himself. A husband who loves his wife shows he loves himself.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">None of us hate our own bodies. We provide for them and take good care of them, just as Christ does for the church,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">because we are each part of his body.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">As the Scriptures say, &amp;apos;A man leaves his father and mother to get married, and he becomes like one person with his wife.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">This is a great mystery, but I understand it to mean Christ and his church.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">So each husband should love his wife as much as he loves himself, and each wife should respect her husband.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1">Children, you belong to the Lord, and you do the right thing when you obey your parents. The first commandment with a promise says,</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="4">Parents, don't be hard on your children. Raise them properly. Teach them and instruct them about the Lord.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Slaves, you must obey your earthly masters. Show them great respect and be as loyal to them as you are to Christ.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Try to please them at all times, and not just when you think they are watching. You are slaves of Christ, so with your whole heart you must do what God wants you to do.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Gladly serve your masters, as though they were the Lord himself, and not simply people.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">You know that you will be rewarded for any good things you do, whether you are slaves or free.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Slave owners, you must treat your slaves with this same respect. Don't threaten them. They have the same Master in heaven that you do, and he doesn't have favorites.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Finally, let the mighty strength of the Lord make you strong.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Put on all the armor that God gives, so you can defend yourself against the devil's tricks.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">We are not fighting against humans. We are fighting against forces and authorities and against rulers of darkness and powers in the spiritual world.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">So put on all the armor that God gives. Then when that evil day comes, you will be able to defend yourself. And when the battle is over, you will still be standing firm.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Be ready! Let the truth be like a belt around your waist, and let God's justice protect you like armor.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="17">Let God's saving power be like a helmet, and for a sword use God's message that comes from the Spirit.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Never stop praying, especially for others. Always pray by the power of the Spirit. Stay alert and keep praying for God's people.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="20">I was sent to do this work, and this is the reason I am in jail. So pray that I will be brave and will speak as I should.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="3">Every time I think of you, I thank my God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">And whenever I mention you in my prayers, it makes me happy.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">This is because you have taken part with me in spreading the good news from the first day you heard about it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">God is the one who began this good work in you, and I am certain that he won't stop before it is complete on the day that Christ Jesus returns.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">You have a special place in my heart. So it is only natural for me to feel the way I do. All of you have helped in the work God has given me, as I defend the good news and tell about it here in jail.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">God himself knows how much I want to see you. He knows I care for you in the same way Christ Jesus does.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">I pray that your love will keep on growing and you will fully know and understand</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">how to make the right choices. Then you will still be pure and innocent when Christ returns. And until that day,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Jesus Christ will keep you busy doing good deeds that bring glory and praise to God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">My dear friends, I want you to know that what has happened to me has helped to spread the good news.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">The Roman guards and all the others know I am here in jail because I serve Christ.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Now most of the Lord's followers have become brave and are fearlessly telling the message.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Some are preaching about Christ because they are jealous and envious of us. Others are preaching because they want to help.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">They love Christ and know I am here to defend the good news about him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">But the ones who are jealous of us are not sincere. They just want to cause trouble for me while I am in jail.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">But that doesn't matter. All that matters is that people are telling about Christ, whether they are sincere or not. This is what makes me glad.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">because I know that your prayers and the help that comes from the Spirit of Christ Jesus will keep me safe.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">I honestly expect and hope I will never do anything to be ashamed of. Whether I live or die, I always want to be as brave as I am now and bring honor to Christ.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">If I live, it will be for Christ, and if I die, I will gain even more.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">I don't know what to choose. I could keep on living and doing something useful.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">It is a hard choice to make. I want to die and be with Christ, because this would be much better.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">Then, when I visit you again, you will have good reason to take great pride in Christ Jesus because of me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">Above all else, you must live in a way that brings honor to the good news about Christ. Then, whether I visit you or not, I will hear that all of you think alike. I will know that you are working together and are struggling side by side to get others to believe the good news.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">Be brave when you face your enemies. Your courage will show them that they are going to be destroyed, and it will show you that you will be saved. God will make all of this happen,</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="5">and think the same way that Christ Jesus thought: equal with God. and became a slave, when he became like one of us. He obeyed God and even died on a cross. the highest place and honored his name above all others. everyone will bow down, those in heaven, on earth, and under the earth. of God the Father everyone will openly agree, &amp;apos;Jesus Christ is Lord!&amp;apos;</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="14">Do everything without grumbling or arguing.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Then you will be the pure and innocent children of God. You live among people who are crooked and evil, but you must not do anything they can say is wrong. Try to shine as lights among the people of this world,</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="27">In fact, he was very sick and almost died. But God was kind to him, and also to me, and he kept me from being burdened down with sorrow.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="2">Watch out for those people who behave like dogs! They are evil and want to do more than just circumcise you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">But we are the ones who are truly circumcised, because we worship by the power of God's Spirit and take pride in Christ Jesus. We don't brag about what we have done,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">although I could. Others may brag about themselves, but I have more reason to brag than anyone else.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">I was circumcised when I was eight days old, and I am from the nation of Israel and the tribe of Benjamin. I am a true Hebrew. As a Pharisee, I strictly obeyed the Law of Moses.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">And I was so eager I even made trouble for the church. I did everything the Law demands in order to please God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">But Christ has shown me that what I once thought was valuable is worthless.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Nothing is as wonderful as knowing Christ Jesus my Lord. I have given up everything else and count it all as garbage. All I want is Christ</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">and to know that I belong to him. I could not make myself acceptable to God by obeying the Law of Moses. God accepted me simply because of my faith in Christ.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">All I want is to know Christ and the power that raised him to life. I want to suffer and die as he did,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">so that somehow I also may be raised to life.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="13">My friends, I don't feel I have already arrived. But I forget what is behind, and I struggle for what is ahead.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">I run toward the goal, so I can win the prize of being called to heaven. This is the prize God offers because of what Christ Jesus has done.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">All of us who are mature should think in this same way. And if any of you think differently, God will make it clear to you.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="3">And, my true partner, I ask you to help them. These women have worked together with me and with Clement and with the others in spreading the good news. Their names are now written in the book of life.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Always be glad because of the Lord! I will say it again: Be glad.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Always be gentle with others. The Lord will soon be here.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Don't worry about anything, but pray about everything. With thankful hearts offer up your prayers and requests to God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Then, because you belong to Christ Jesus, God will bless you with peace that no one can completely understand. And this peace will control the way you think and feel.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Finally, my friends, keep your minds on whatever is true, pure, right, holy, friendly, and proper. Don't ever stop thinking about what is truly worthwhile and worthy of praise.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">You know the teachings I gave you, and you know what you heard me say and saw me do. So follow my example. And God, who gives peace, will be with you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">The Lord has made me very grateful that at last you have thought about me once again. Actually, you were thinking about me all along, but you didn't have any chance to show it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">I am not complaining about having too little. I have learned to be satisfied with whatever I have.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">I know what it is to be poor or to have plenty, and I have lived under all kinds of conditions. I know what it means to be full or to be hungry, to have too much or too little.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Christ gives me the strength to face anything.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">It was good of you to help me when I was having such a hard time.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">My friends at Philippi, you remember what it was like when I started preaching the good news in Macedonia. After I left there, you were the only church that became my partner by giving blessings and by receiving them in return.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Even when I was in Thessalonica, you helped me more than once.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">I am not trying to get something from you, but I want you to receive the blessings that come from giving.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">I have been paid back everything, and with interest. I am completely satisfied with the gifts you sent with Epaphroditus. They are like a sweet-smelling offering or like the right kind of sacrifice that pleases God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">I pray that God will take care of all your needs with the wonderful blessings that come from Christ Jesus!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">May God our Father be praised forever and ever. Amen.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Give my greetings to all who are God's people because of Christ Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">All of God's people send their greetings, especially those in the service of the Emperor.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">I pray that our Lord Jesus Christ will be kind to you and will bless your life!</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1">From Paul, chosen by God to be an apostle of Christ Jesus, and from Timothy, who is also a follower. I pray that God our Father will be kind to you and will bless you with peace! who cannot be seen. He is the first-born Son, superior to all creation. everything in heaven and on earth, everything seen and unseen, including all forces and powers, and all rulers and authorities. All things were created by God's Son, and everything was made for him. and by him everything is held together. which is the church. He is the very beginning, the first to be raised from death, so that he would be above all others. to live fully in his Son. for him to make peace by sacrificing his blood on the cross, so that all beings in heaven and on earth would be brought back to God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">To God's people who live in Colossae and are faithful followers of Christ.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Each time we pray for you, we thank God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">We have heard of your faith in Christ and of your love for all God's people,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">because what you hope for is kept safe for you in heaven. You first heard about this hope when you believed the true message, which is the good news.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">The good news is spreading all over the world with great success. It has spread in this same way among you, ever since the first day you learned the truth about God's wonderful kindness</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">from our good friend Epaphras. He works together with us for Christ and is a faithful worker for you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">He is also the one who told us about the love that God's Spirit has given you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">We have not stopped praying for you since the first day we heard about you. In fact, we always pray that God will show you everything he wants you to do and that you may have all the wisdom and understanding his Spirit gives.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Then you will live a life that honors the Lord, and you will always please him by doing good deeds. You will come to know God even better.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">His glorious power will make you patient and strong enough to endure anything, and you will be truly happy.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">I pray that you will be grateful to God for letting you have part in what he has promised his people in the kingdom of light.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">God rescued us from the dark power of Satan and brought us into the kingdom of his dear Son,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">who forgives our sins and sets us free.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Christ is exactly like God,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Everything was created by him,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">God's Son was before all else,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">He is the head of his body,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">God himself was pleased</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">And God was pleased</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">You used to be far from God. Your thoughts made you his enemies, and you did evil things.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">But his Son became a human and died. So God made peace with you, and now he lets you stand in his presence as people who are holy and faultless and innocent.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">But you must stay deeply rooted and firm in your faith. You must not give up the hope you received when you heard the good news. It was preached to everyone on earth, and I myself have become a servant of this message.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">I am glad I can suffer for you. I am pleased also that in my own body I can continue the suffering of Christ for his body, the church.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">God's plan was to make me a servant of his church and to send me to preach his complete message to you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">For ages and ages this message was kept secret from everyone, but now it has been explained to God's people.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">God did this because he wanted you Gentiles to understand his wonderful and glorious mystery. And the mystery is that Christ lives in you, and he is your hope of sharing in God's glory.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">We announce the message about Christ, and we use all our wisdom to warn and teach everyone, so all of Christ's followers will grow and become mature.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">This is why I work so hard and use the mighty power he gives me.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="2">
			<VERS vnumber="1">I want you to know what a struggle I am going through for you, for God's people at Laodicea, and for all of those followers who have never met me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">I do it to encourage them. Then as their hearts are joined together in love, they will be wonderfully blessed with complete understanding. And they will truly know Christ. Not only is he the key to God's mystery,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">but all wisdom and knowledge are hidden away in him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">I tell you these things to keep you from being fooled by fancy talk.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Even though I am not with you, I keep thinking about you. I am glad to know that you are living as you should and your faith in Christ is strong.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">You have accepted Christ Jesus as your Lord. Now keep on following him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Plant your roots in Christ and let him be the foundation for your life. Be strong in your faith, just as you were taught. And be grateful.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Don't let anyone fool you by using senseless arguments. These arguments may sound wise, but they are only human teachings. They come from the powers of this world and not from Christ.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">God lives fully in Christ.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">And you are fully grown because you belong to Christ, who is over every power and authority.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Christ has also taken away your selfish desires, just as circumcision removes flesh from the body.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">And when you were baptized, it was the same as being buried with Christ. Then you were raised to life because you had faith in the power of God, who raised Christ from death.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">You were dead, because you were sinful and were not God's people. But God let Christ make you alive, when he forgave all our sins.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">God wiped out the charges that were against us for disobeying the Law of Moses. He took them away and nailed them to the cross.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">There Christ defeated all powers and forces. He let the whole world see them being led away as prisoners when he celebrated his victory.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Don't let anyone tell you what you must eat or drink. Don't let them say you must celebrate the New Moon festival, the Sabbath, or any other festival.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">These things are only a shadow of what was to come. But Christ is real!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Don't be cheated by people who make a show of acting humble and who worship angels. They brag about seeing visions. But it is all nonsense, because their minds are filled with selfish desires.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">They are no longer part of Christ, who is the head of the whole body. Christ gives the body its strength, and he uses its joints and muscles to hold it together, as it grows by the power of God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">You died with Christ. Now the forces of the universe don't have any power over you. Why do you live as if you had to obey such rules as,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">&amp;apos;Don't handle this. Don't taste that. Don't touch this.&amp;apos;?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">After these things are used, they are no longer good for anything. So why be bothered with the rules that humans have made up?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">Obeying these rules may seem to be the smart thing to do. They appear to make you love God more and to be very humble and to have control over your body. But they don't really have any power over our desires.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="3">
			<VERS vnumber="1">You have been raised to life with Christ. Now set your heart on what is in heaven, where Christ rules at God's right side.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Think about what is up there, not about what is here on earth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">You died, which means that your life is hidden with Christ, who sits beside God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Christ gives meaning to your life, and when he appears, you will also appear with him in glory.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Don't be controlled by your body. Kill every desire for the wrong kind of sex. Don't be immoral or indecent or have evil thoughts. Don't be greedy, which is the same as worshiping idols.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">God is angry with people who disobey him by doing these things.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">And this is exactly what you did, when you lived among people who behaved in this way.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">But now you must stop doing such things. You must quit being angry, hateful, and evil. You must no longer say insulting or cruel things about others.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">And stop lying to each other. You have given up your old way of life with its habits.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Each of you is now a new person. You are becoming more and more like your Creator, and you will understand him better.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">It doesn't matter if you are a Greek or a Jew, or if you are circumcised or not. You may even be a barbarian or a Scythian, and you may be a slave or a free person. Yet Christ is all that matters, and he lives in all of us.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">God loves you and has chosen you as his own special people. So be gentle, kind, humble, meek, and patient.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Put up with each other, and forgive anyone who does you wrong, just as Christ has forgiven you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Love is more important than anything else. It is what ties everything completely together.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Each one of you is part of the body of Christ, and you were chosen to live together in peace. So let the peace that comes from Christ control your thoughts. And be grateful.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Let the message about Christ completely fill your lives, while you use all your wisdom to teach and instruct each other. With thankful hearts, sing psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs to God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Whatever you say or do should be done in the name of the Lord Jesus, as you give thanks to God the Father because of him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">A wife must put her husband first. This is her duty as a follower of the Lord.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">A husband must love his wife and not abuse her.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Children must always obey their parents. This pleases the Lord.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Parents, don't be hard on your children. If you are, they might give up.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Slaves, you must always obey your earthly masters. Try to please them at all times, and not just when you think they are watching. Honor the Lord and serve your masters with your whole heart.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">Do your work willingly, as though you were serving the Lord himself, and not just your earthly master.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">In fact, the Lord Christ is the one you are really serving, and you know he will reward you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">But Christ has no favorites! He will punish evil people, just as they deserve.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="4">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Slave owners, be fair and honest with your slaves. Don't forget that you have a Master in heaven. Don't forget that I am in jail. I pray that God will be kind to you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Never give up praying. And when you pray, keep alert and be thankful.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Be sure to pray that God will make a way for us to spread his message and explain the mystery about Christ, even though I am in jail for doing this.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Please pray that I will make the message as clear as possible.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">When you are with unbelievers, always make good use of the time.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Be pleasant and hold their interest when you speak the message. Choose your words carefully and be ready to give answers to anyone who asks questions.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Tychicus is the dear friend, who faithfully works and serves the Lord with us, and he will give you the news about me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">I am sending him to cheer you up by telling you how we are getting along.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Onesimus, the dear and faithful follower from your own group, is coming with him. The two of them will tell you everything that has happened here.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Aristarchus is in jail with me. He sends greetings to you, and so does Mark, the cousin of Barnabas. You have already been told to welcome Mark, if he visits you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Jesus, who is known as Justus, sends his greetings. These three men are the only Jewish followers who have worked with me for the kingdom of God. They have given me much comfort.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Your own Epaphras, who serves Christ Jesus, sends his greetings. He always prays hard that you may fully know what the Lord wants you to do and that you may do it completely.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">I have seen how much trouble he has gone through for you and for the followers in Laodicea and Hierapolis.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Our dear doctor Luke sends you his greetings, and so does Demas.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1">From Paul, Silas, and Timothy. To the church in Thessalonica, the people of God the Father and of the Lord Jesus Christ. I pray that God will be kind to you and will bless you with peace!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">We thank God for you and always mention you in our prayers. Each time we pray,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">we tell God our Father about your faith and loving work and about your firm hope in our Lord Jesus Christ.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">My dear friends, God loves you, and we know he has chosen you to be his people.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">When we told you the good news, it was with the power and assurance that come from the Holy Spirit, and not simply with words. You knew what kind of people we were and how we helped you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">So, when you accepted the message, you followed our example and the example of the Lord. You suffered, but the Holy Spirit made you glad.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">You became an example for all the Lord's followers in Macedonia and Achaia.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">And because of you, the Lord's message has spread everywhere in those regions. Now the news of your faith in God is known all over the world, and we don't have to say a thing about it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Everyone is talking about how you welcomed us and how you turned away from idols to serve the true and living God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">They also tell how you are waiting for his Son Jesus to come from heaven. God raised him from death, and on the day of judgment Jesus will save us from God's anger.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="2">
			<VERS vnumber="1">My friends, you know our time with you wasn't wasted.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">As you remember, we had been mistreated and insulted at Philippi. But God gave us the courage to tell you the good news about him, even though many people caused us trouble.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">We didn't have any hidden motives when we won you over, and we didn't try to fool or trick anyone.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">God was pleased to trust us with his message. We didn't speak to please people, but to please God who knows our motives.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">You also know we didn't try to flatter anyone. God himself knows what we did wasn't a cover-up for greed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">We were not trying to get you or anyone else to praise us.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">But as apostles, we could have demanded help from you. After all, Christ is the one who sent us. We chose to be like children or like a mother nursing her baby.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">We cared so much for you, and you became so dear to us, that we were willing to give our lives for you when we gave you God's message.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">My dear friends, you surely haven't forgotten our hard work and hardships. You remember how night and day we struggled to make a living, so we could tell you God's message without being a burden to anyone.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Both you and God are witnesses that we were pure and honest and innocent in our dealings with you followers of the Lord.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">You also know we did everything for you that parents would do for their own children.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">We begged, encouraged, and urged each of you to live in a way that would honor God. He is the one who chose you to share in his own kingdom and glory.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">We always thank God that you believed the message we preached. It came from him, and it isn't something made up by humans. You accepted it as God's message, and now he is working in you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">My friends, you did just like God's churches in Judea and like the other followers of Christ Jesus there. And so, you were mistreated by your own people, in the same way they were mistreated by their people.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Those evil people killed the Lord Jesus and the prophets, and they even chased us away. God doesn't like what they do and neither does anyone else.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">They keep us from speaking his message to the Gentiles and from leading them to be saved. They have always gone too far with their sins. Now God has finally become angry and will punish them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">My friends, we were kept from coming to you for a while, but we never stopped thinking about you. We were eager to see you and tried our best to visit you in person.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">We really wanted to come. I myself tried several times, but Satan always stopped us.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">After all, when the Lord Jesus appears, who else but you will give us hope and joy and be like a glorious crown for us?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">You alone are our glory and joy!</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="3">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Finally, we couldn't stand it any longer. We decided to stay in Athens by ourselves</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">and send our friend Timothy to you. He works with us as God's servant and preaches the good news about Christ. We wanted him to make you strong in your faith and to encourage you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">We didn't want any of you to be discouraged by all these troubles. You knew we would have to suffer,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">because when we were with you, we told you this would happen. And we did suffer, as you well know.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">At last, when I could not wait any longer, I sent Timothy to find out about your faith. I hoped Satan had not tempted you and made all our work useless.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Timothy has now come back from his visit with you and has told us about your faith and love. He also said that you always have happy memories of us and that you want to see us as much as we want to see you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">My friends, even though we have a lot of trouble and suffering, your faith makes us feel better about you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Your strong faith in the Lord is like a breath of new life.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">How can we possibly thank God enough for all the happiness you have brought us?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Day and night we sincerely pray that we will see you again and help you to have an even stronger faith.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">We pray that God our Father and our Lord Jesus will let us visit you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">May the Lord make your love for each other and for everyone else grow by leaps and bounds. This is how our love for you has grown.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">And when our Lord comes with all his people, I pray he will make your hearts pure and innocent in the sight of God the Father.</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="4">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Finally, my dear friends, since you belong to the Lord Jesus, we beg and urge you to live as we taught you. Then you will please God. You are already living that way, but try even harder.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Remember the instructions we gave you as followers of the Lord Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">God wants you to be holy, so don't be immoral in matters of sex.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Respect and honor your wife.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Don't be a slave of your desires or live like people who don't know God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">You must not cheat any of the Lord's followers in matters of sex. Remember, we warned you that he punishes everyone who does such things.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">God didn't choose you to be filthy, but to be pure.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">So if you don't obey these rules, you are not really disobeying us. Instead, you are disobeying God, who gives you his Holy Spirit.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">We don't have to write you about the need to love each other. God has taught you to do this,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">and you already have shown your love for all his people in Macedonia. But, my dear friends, we ask you to do even more.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Try your best to live quietly, to mind your own business, and to work hard, just as we taught you to do.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Then you will be respected by people who are not followers of the Lord, and you won't have to depend on anyone.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">My friends, we want you to understand how it will be for those followers who have already died. Then you won't grieve over them and be like people who don't have any hope.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">We believe Jesus died and was raised to life. We also believe that when God brings Jesus back again, he will bring with him all who had faith in Jesus before they died.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Our Lord Jesus told us that when he comes, we won't go up to meet him ahead of his followers who have already died.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">With a loud command and with the shout of the chief angel and a blast of God's trumpet, the Lord will return from heaven. Then those who had faith in Christ before they died will be raised to life.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Next, all of us who are still alive will be taken up into the clouds together with them to meet the Lord in the sky. From that time on we will all be with the Lord forever.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Encourage each other with these words.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="5">
			<VERS vnumber="1">I don't need to write you about the time or date when all this will happen.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">You surely know that the Lord's return will be as a thief coming at night.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">People will think they are safe and secure. But destruction will suddenly strike them like the pains of a woman about to give birth. And they won't escape.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">My dear friends, you don't live in darkness, and so that day won't surprise you like a thief.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">You belong to the light and live in the day. We don't live in the night or belong to the dark.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Others may sleep, but we should stay awake and be alert.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">People sleep during the night, and some even get drunk.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">But we belong to the day. So we must stay sober and let our faith and love be like a suit of armor. Our firm hope that we will be saved is our helmet.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">God doesn't intend to punish us, but wants us to be saved by our Lord Jesus Christ.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Christ died for us, so we could live with him, whether we are alive or dead when he comes.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">This is why you must encourage and help each other, just as you are already doing.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">My friends, we ask you to be thoughtful of your leaders who work hard and tell you how to live for the Lord.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Show them great respect and love because of their work. Try to get along with each other.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">My friends, we beg you to warn anyone who isn't living right. Encourage anyone who feels left out, help all who are weak, and be patient with everyone.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Don't be hateful to people, just because they are hateful to you. Rather, be good to each other and to everyone else.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Always be joyful</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">and never stop praying.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Whatever happens, keep thanking God because of Jesus Christ. This is what God wants you to do.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Don't turn away God's Spirit</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">or ignore prophecies.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Put everything to the test. Accept what is good</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">and don't have anything to do with evil.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">I pray that God, who gives peace, will make you completely holy. And may your spirit, soul, and body be kept healthy and faultless until our Lord Jesus Christ returns.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">The one who chose you can be trusted, and he will do this.</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="1">
			<VERS vnumber="1">From Paul, Silas, and Timothy. To the church in Thessalonica, the people of God our Father and of the Lord Jesus Christ. Our Lord Jesus will punish anyone who doesn't know God and won't obey his message.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">I pray that God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ will be kind to you and will bless you with peace!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">My dear friends, we always have good reason to thank God for you, because your faith in God and your love for each other keep growing all the time.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">This is why we brag about you to all of God's churches. We tell them how patient you are and how you keep on having faith, even though you are going through a lot of trouble and suffering.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">All this shows that God judges fairly and is making you fit to share in his kingdom for which you are suffering.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">It is only right for God to punish everyone who is causing you trouble,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">but he will give you relief from your troubles. God will do the same for us, when the Lord Jesus comes from heaven with his powerful angels</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">and with a flaming fire.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Their punishment will be eternal destruction, and they will be kept far from the presence of our Lord and his glorious strength.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">This will happen on the day when the Lord returns to be praised and honored by all who have faith in him and belong to him. This includes you, because you believed what we said.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">God chose you, and we keep praying that God will make you worthy of being his people. We pray for God's power to help you do all the good things you hope to do and your faith makes you want to do.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Then, because of the undeserved grace of God and our Lord Jesus Christ, you will bring honor to the name of our Lord Jesus, and he will bring honor to you.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="2">
			<VERS vnumber="1">When our Lord Jesus returns, we will be gathered up to meet him. So I ask you, my friends,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">not to be easily upset or disturbed by people who claim the Lord has already come. They may say they heard this directly from the Holy Spirit, or from someone else, or even that they read it in one of our letters.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">But don't be fooled! People will rebel against God. Then before the Lord returns, the wicked one who is doomed to be destroyed will appear.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">He will brag and oppose everything holy or sacred. He will even sit in God's temple and claim to be God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Don't you remember I told you this while I was still with you?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">You already know what is holding this wicked one back until it is time for him to come.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">His mysterious power is already at work, but someone is holding him back. And the wicked one won't appear until this someone is out of the way.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Then he will appear, but the Lord Jesus will kill him simply by breathing on him. He will be completely destroyed by the Lord's glorious return.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">When the wicked one appears, Satan will pretend to work all kinds of miracles, wonders, and signs.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Lost people will be fooled by his evil deeds. They could be saved, but they will refuse to love the truth and accept it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">So God will make sure they are fooled into believing a lie.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">All of them will be punished, because they would rather do evil than believe the truth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">My friends, the Lord loves you, and it is only natural for us to thank God for you. God chose you to be the first ones to be saved. His Spirit made you holy, and you put your faith in the truth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">God used our preaching as his way of inviting you to share in the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">My friends, this is why you must remain faithful and follow closely what we taught you in person and by our letters.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">God our Father loves us. He treats us with undeserved grace and has given us eternal comfort and a wonderful hope. We pray that our Lord Jesus Christ and God our Father</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">will encourage you and help you always to do and say the right thing.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="3">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Finally, our friends, please pray for us. This will help the message about the Lord to spread quickly, and others will respect it, just as you do.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Pray that we may be kept safe from worthless and evil people. After all, not everyone has faith.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">But the Lord can be trusted to make you strong and protect you from harm.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">He has made us sure that you are obeying what we taught you and that you will keep on obeying.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">I pray that the Lord will guide you to be as loving as God and as patient as Christ.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">My dear friends, in the name of the Lord Jesus, I beg you not to have anything to do with any of your people who loaf around and refuse to obey the instructions we gave you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">You surely know that you should follow our example. We didn't waste our time loafing,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">and we didn't accept food from anyone without paying for it. We didn't want to be a burden to any of you, so night and day we worked as hard as we could.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">We had the right not to work, but we wanted to set an example for you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">We also gave you this rule: If you don't work, you don't eat.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Now we learn that some of you just loaf around and won't do any work, except the work of a busybody.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">So, for the sake of our Lord Jesus Christ, we ask and beg these people to settle down and start working for a living.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Dear friends, you must never become tired of doing right.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Be on your guard against any followers who refuse to obey what we have written in this letter. Put them to shame by not having anything to do with them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Don't consider them your enemies. Instead, speak kindly to them as you would to any other follower.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">I pray that the Lord, who gives peace, will always bless you with peace. May the Lord be with all of you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">I always sign my letters as I am now doing: PAUL.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="2">Timothy, because of our faith, you are like a son to me. I pray that God our Father and our Lord Jesus Christ will be kind and merciful to you. May they bless you with peace!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">When I was leaving for Macedonia, I asked you to stay on in Ephesus and warn certain people there to stop spreading their false teachings.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">You needed to warn them to stop wasting their time on senseless stories and endless lists of ancestors. Such things only cause arguments. They don't help anyone to do God's work that can only be done by faith.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">You must teach people to have genuine love, as well as a good conscience and true faith.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">There are some who have given up these for nothing but empty talk.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">They want to be teachers of the Law of Moses. But they don't know what they are talking about, even though they think they do.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">We know the Law is good, if it is used in the right way.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">We also understand it wasn't given to control people who please God, but to control lawbreakers, criminals, godless people, and sinners. It is for wicked and evil people, and for murderers, who would even kill their own parents.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">The Law was written for people who are sexual perverts or who live as homosexuals or are kidnappers or liars or won't tell the truth in court. It is for anything else that opposes the correct teaching</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">of the good news the glorious and wonderful God has given me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who has given me the strength for my work because he knew he could trust me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">I used to say terrible and insulting things about him, and I was cruel. But Christ had mercy on me because I didn't know what I was doing, and I had not yet put my faith in him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Christ Jesus our Lord treated me with undeserved grace and has greatly blessed my life with faith and love just like his own.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">&amp;apos;Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners.&amp;apos; This saying is true, and it can be trusted. I was the worst sinner of all!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">But since I was worse than anyone else, God had mercy on me and let me be an example of the endless patience of Christ Jesus. He did this so that others would put their faith in Christ and have eternal life.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">I pray that honor and glory will always be given to the only God, who lives forever and is the invisible and eternal King! Amen.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Timothy, my son, the instructions I am giving you are based on what some prophets once said about you. If you follow these instructions, you will fight like a good soldier.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">You will be faithful and have a clear conscience. Some people have made a mess of their faith because they didn't listen to their consciences.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Two of them are Hymenaeus and Alexander. I have given these men over to the power of Satan, so they will learn not to oppose God.</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="2">
			<VERS vnumber="1">First of all, I ask you to pray for everyone. Ask God to help and bless them all, and tell God how thankful you are for each of them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Pray for kings and others in power, so we may live quiet and peaceful lives as we worship and honor God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">This kind of prayer is good, and it pleases God our Savior.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">God wants everyone to be saved and to know the whole truth, which is, and Christ Jesus is the only one who can bring us to God. Jesus was truly human, and he gave himself to rescue all of us. at the right time.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">There is only one God,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">God showed us this</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">This is why God chose me to be a preacher and an apostle of the good news. I am telling the truth. I am not lying. God sent me to teach the Gentiles about faith and truth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">I want everyone everywhere to lift innocent hands toward heaven and pray, without being angry or arguing with each other.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">I would like for women to wear modest and sensible clothes. They should not have fancy hairdos, or wear expensive clothes, or put on jewelry made of gold or pearls.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Women who claim to love God should do helpful things for others,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">and they should learn by being quiet and paying attention.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">They should be silent and not be allowed to teach or to tell men what to do.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">After all, Adam was created before Eve,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">and the man Adam wasn't the one who was fooled. It was the woman Eve who was completely fooled and sinned.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">But women will be saved by having children, if they stay faithful, loving, holy, and modest.</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="3">
			<VERS vnumber="1">It is true that anyone who desires to be a church official wants to be something worthwhile.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">That's why officials must have a good reputation and be faithful in marriage. They must be self-controlled, sensible, well-behaved, friendly to strangers, and able to teach.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">They must not be heavy drinkers or troublemakers. Instead, they must be kind and gentle and not love money. The Spirit proved that he pleased God, and he was seen by angels. Christ was preached to the nations. People in this world put their faith in him, and he was taken up to glory.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Church officials must be in control of their own families, and they must see that their children are obedient and always respectful.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">If they don't know how to control their own families, how can they look after God's people?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">They must not be new followers of the Lord. If they are, they might become proud and be doomed along with the devil.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Finally, they must be well-respected by people who are not followers. Then they won't be trapped and disgraced by the devil.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Church officers should be serious. They must not be liars, heavy drinkers, or greedy for money.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">And they must have a clear conscience and hold firmly to what God has shown us about our faith.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">They must first prove themselves. Then if no one has anything against them, they can serve as officers.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Women must also be serious. They must not gossip or be heavy drinkers, and they must be faithful in everything they do.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Church officers must be faithful in marriage. They must be in full control of their children and everyone else in their home.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Those who serve well as officers will earn a good reputation and will be highly respected for their faith in Christ Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">I hope to visit you soon. But I am writing these instructions,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">so if I am delayed, you will know how everyone who belongs to God's family ought to behave. After all, the church of the living God is the strong foundation of truth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Here is the great mystery of our religion: Christ came as a human.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="4">
			<VERS vnumber="1">God's Spirit clearly says that in the last days many people will turn from their faith. They will be fooled by evil spirits and by teachings that come from demons.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">They will also be fooled by the false claims of liars whose consciences have lost all feeling. These liars</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">will forbid people to marry or to eat certain foods. But God created these foods to be eaten with thankful hearts by his followers who know the truth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Everything God created is good. And if you give thanks, you may eat anything.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">What God has said and your prayer will make it fit to eat. &amp;apos;Exercise is good for your body, but religion helps you in every way. It promises life now and forever.&amp;apos; These words are worthwhile and should not be forgotten.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">If you teach these things to other followers, you will be a good servant of Christ Jesus. You will show you have grown up on the teachings about our faith and on the good instructions you have obeyed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Don't have anything to do with worthless, senseless stories. Work hard to be truly religious.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">We have put our hope in the living God, who is the Savior of everyone, but especially of those who have faith. This is why we work and struggle so hard.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Teach these things and tell everyone to do what you say.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Don't let anyone make fun of you, just because you are young. Set an example for other followers by what you say and do, as well as by your love, faith, and purity.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Until I arrive, be sure to keep on reading the Scriptures in worship, and don't stop preaching and teaching.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Use the gift you were given when the prophets spoke and the group of church leaders blessed you by placing their hands on you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Remember these things and think about them, so everyone can see how well you are doing.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Be careful about the way you live and about what you teach. Keep on doing this, and you will save not only yourself, but the people who hear you.</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="5">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Don't correct an older man. Encourage him, as you would your own father. Treat younger men as you would your own brother,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">and treat older women as you would your own mother. Show the same respect to younger women that you would to your sister. Don't sin because others do, but stay close to God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Take care of any widow who is really in need.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">But if a widow has children or grandchildren, they should learn to serve God by taking care of her, as she once took care of them. This is what God wants them to do.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">A widow who is really in need is one who doesn't have any relatives. She has faith in God, and she keeps praying to him night and day, asking for his help.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">A widow who thinks only about having a good time is already dead, even though she is still alive.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Tell all this to everyone, so they will do the right thing.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">People who don't take care of their relatives, and especially their own families, have given up their faith. They are worse than someone who doesn't have faith in the Lord.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">For a widow to be put on the list of widows, she must be at least 60 years old, and she must have been faithful in marriage.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">She must also be well-known for doing all sorts of good things, such as raising children, giving food to strangers, welcoming God's people into her home, helping people in need, and always making herself useful.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Don't put young widows on the list. They may later have a strong desire to get married. Then they will turn away from Christ</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">and become guilty of breaking their promise to him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Besides, they will become lazy and get into the habit of going from house to house. Next, they will start gossiping and become busybodies, talking about things that are none of their business.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">I would prefer that young widows get married, have children, and look after their families. Then the enemy won't have any reason to say insulting things about us.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Look what's already happened to some of the young widows! They have turned away to follow Satan.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">If a woman who is a follower has any widows in her family, she should help them. This will keep the church from having that burden, and then the church can help widows who are really in need.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Church leaders who do their job well deserve to be paid twice as much, especially if they work hard at preaching and teaching.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">It is just as the Scriptures say, &amp;apos;Don't muzzle an ox when you are using it to grind grain.&amp;apos; You also know the saying, &amp;apos;Workers are worth their pay.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Don't listen to any charge against a church leader, unless at least two or three people bring the same charges.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">But if any of the leaders should keep on sinning, they must be corrected in front of the whole group, as a warning to everyone else.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">In the presence of God and Christ Jesus and their chosen angels, I order you to follow my instructions! Be fair with everyone, and don't have any favorites.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Don't be too quick to accept people into the service of the Lord by placing your hands on them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">Stop drinking only water. Take a little wine to help your stomach trouble and the other illnesses you often have.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">Some people get caught in their sins almost at once, even before the time of judgment. But other people's sins don't show up until later.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">It is the same with good deeds. Some are easily seen, but none of them can be hidden.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="6">
			<VERS vnumber="1">If you are a slave, you should respect and honor your owner. This will keep people from saying bad things about God and about our teaching.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">If any of you slaves have owners who are followers, you should show them respect. After all, they are also followers of Christ, and he loves them. So you should serve and help them the best you can. These are the things you must teach and tell the people to do. These people think religion is supposed to make you rich. is the only Ruler, the King of kings and Lord of lords. At the time that God has already decided, he will send Jesus Christ back again. And he lives in light that no one can come near. No human has ever seen God or ever can see him. God will be honored, and his power will last forever. Amen. I pray that the Lord will be kind to all of you!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Anyone who teaches something different disagrees with the correct and godly teaching of our Lord Jesus Christ.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Those people who disagree are proud of themselves, but they don't really know a thing. Their minds are sick, and they like to argue over words. They cause jealousy, disagreements, unkind words, evil suspicions,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">and nasty quarrels. They have wicked minds and have missed out on the truth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">And religion does make your life rich, by making you content with what you have.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">We didn't bring anything into this world, and we won't take anything with us when we leave.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="12">Fight a good fight for the faith and claim eternal life. God offered it to you when you clearly told about your faith, while so many people listened.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Now I ask you to make a promise. Make it in the presence of God, who gives life to all, and in the presence of Christ Jesus, who openly told Pontius Pilate about his faith.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Promise to obey completely and fully all that you have been told until our Lord Jesus Christ returns.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">The glorious God</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Only God lives forever!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Warn the rich people of this world not to be proud or to trust in wealth that is easily lost. Tell them to have faith in God, who is rich and blesses us with everything we need to enjoy life.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Instruct them to do as many good deeds as they can and to help everyone. Remind the rich to be generous and share what they have.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="19">But the foundation God has laid is solid. On it is written, &amp;apos;The Lord knows who his people are. So everyone who worships the Lord must turn away from evil.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">In a large house some dishes are made of gold or silver, while others are made of wood or clay. Some of these are special, and others are not.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1">We must give our full attention to what we were told, so we won't drift away.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">The message spoken by angels proved to be true, and all who disobeyed or rejected it were punished as they deserved.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">So if we refuse this great way of being saved, how can we hope to escape? The Lord himself was the first to tell about it, and people who heard the message proved to us that it was true.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">God himself showed that his message was true by working all kinds of powerful miracles and wonders.

			<VERS vnumber="8">And you have put everything</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">What we do see is Jesus, who for a little while was made lower than the angels. Because of God's gift of undeserved grace, Jesus died for everyone. And now that Jesus has suffered and died, he is crowned with glory and honor!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Everything belongs to God, and all things were created by his power. So God did the right thing when he made Jesus perfect by suffering, as Jesus led many of God's children to be saved and to share in his glory.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Jesus and the people he makes holy all belong to the same family. This is why he isn't ashamed to call them his brothers and sisters.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">He even said to God,</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="14">We are people of flesh and blood. This is why Jesus became one of us. He died to destroy the devil, who had power over death.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">But he also died to rescue all of us who live each day in fear of dying.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Jesus clearly did not come to help angels, but he did come to help Abraham's descendants.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">He had to be one of us, so he could serve God as our merciful and faithful high priest and sacrifice himself for the forgiveness of our sins.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="6">But Christ is the Son in charge of God's people. And we are those people, if we keep on being brave and don't lose hope.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="13">You must encourage one another each day. And you must keep on while there is still a time that can be called &amp;apos;today.&amp;apos; If you don't, then sin may fool some of you and make you stubborn.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">We were sure about Christ when we first became his people. So let's hold tightly to our faith until the end.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">The Scriptures say,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Who were those people that heard God's voice and rebelled? Weren't they the same ones that came out of Egypt with Moses?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Who were the people that made God angry for 40 years? Weren't they the ones that sinned and died in the desert?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">And who did God say would never enter his place of rest? Weren't they the ones that disobeyed him?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">We see that those people did not enter the place of rest because they did not have faith.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="4">
			<VERS vnumber="1">The promise to enter the place of rest is still good, and we must take care that none of you miss out.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">We have heard the message, just as they did. But they failed to believe what they heard, and the message did not do them any good.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Only people who have faith will enter the place of rest. It is just as the Scriptures say, &amp;apos;God became angry and told the people, &amp;quot;You will never enter my place of rest!&amp;quot; &amp;apos; God said this, even though everything has been ready from the time of creation. &amp;apos;If you hear his voice today, don't be stubborn!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">In fact, somewhere the Scriptures say that by the seventh day, God had finished his work, and so he rested.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">We also read that he later said, &amp;apos;You people will never enter my place of rest!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">This means that the promise to enter is still good, because those who first heard about it disobeyed and did not enter.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Much later God told David to make the promise again, just as I have already said,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">If Joshua had really given the people rest, there would not be any need for God to talk about another day of rest.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">But God has promised us a Sabbath when we will rest, even though it has not yet come.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">On that day God's people will rest from their work, just as God rested from his work.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">We should do our best to enter the place of rest, so none of us will disobey and miss going there, as they did.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">God's word is alive and powerful! It is sharper than any double-edged sword. His word can cut through our spirits and souls and through our joints and marrow, until it discovers the desires and thoughts of our hearts.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Nothing is hidden from God! He sees through everything, and we will have to tell him the truth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">We have a great high priest, who has gone into heaven, and he is Jesus the Son of God. This is why we must hold on to what we have said about him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Jesus understands every weakness of ours, because he was tempted in every way that we are. But he did not sin!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">So whenever we are in need, we should come bravely before the throne of our merciful God. There we will be treated with undeserved grace, and we will find help.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="5">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Every high priest is appointed to help others by offering gifts and sacrifices to God because of their sins.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">A high priest has weaknesses of his own, and he feels sorry for foolish and sinful people.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">This is why he must offer sacrifices for his own sins and for the sins of others.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">But no one can have the honor of being a high priest simply by wanting to be one. Only God can choose a priest, and God is the one who chose Aaron. &amp;apos;You are my Son, because today I have become your Father!&amp;apos; &amp;apos;You are a priest forever</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">This is how it was with Christ. He became a high priest, but not just because he wanted the honor of being one. It was God who told him,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">In another place, God says, just like Melchizedek.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">God had the power to save Jesus from death. And while Jesus was on earth, he begged God with loud crying and tears to save him. He truly worshiped God, and God listened to his prayers.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Jesus is God's own Son, but still he had to suffer before he could learn what it really means to obey God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Suffering made Jesus perfect, and now he can save forever all who obey him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">This is because God chose him to be a high priest like Melchizedek.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Much more could be said about this subject. But it is hard to explain, and all of you are slow to understand.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">By now you should have been teachers, but once again you need to be taught the simplest things about what God has said. You need milk instead of solid food.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">People who live on milk are like babies who don't really know what is right.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Solid food is for mature people who have been trained to know right from wrong.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="6">
			<VERS vnumber="1">We must try to become mature and start thinking about more than just the basic things we were taught about Christ. We shouldn't need to keep talking about why we ought to turn from deeds that bring death and why we ought to have faith in God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">And we shouldn't need to keep teaching about baptisms or about the laying on of hands or about people being raised from death and the future judgment.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Let's grow up, if God is willing. We have run to God for safety. Now his promises should greatly encourage us to take hold of the hope that is right in front of us.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">A field is useful to farmers, if there is enough rain to make good crops grow. In fact, God will bless such a field.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">But land that produces only thornbushes is worthless. It is likely to fall under God's curse, and in the end it will be set on fire.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">My friends, we are talking this way. But we are sure that you are doing those really good things people do when they are being saved.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">God is always fair. He will remember how you helped his people in the past and how you are still helping them. You belong to God, and he won't forget the love you have shown his people.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">We wish each of you would always be eager to show how strong and lasting your hope really is.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Then you would never be lazy. You would be following the example of those who had faith and were patient until God kept his promise to them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">No one is greater than God. So he made a promise in his own name when he said to Abraham,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">&amp;apos;I, the Lord, will bless you with many descendants!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Then after Abraham had been very patient, he was given what God had promised.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">When anyone wants to settle an argument, they make a vow by using the name of someone or something greater than themselves.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">So when God wanted to prove for certain his promise to his people could not be broken, he made a vow.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">God cannot tell lies! And so his promises and vows are two things that can never be changed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">This hope is like a firm and steady anchor for our souls. In fact, hope reaches behind the curtain and into the most holy place.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Jesus has gone there ahead of us, and he is our high priest forever, just like Melchizedek.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="7">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Melchizedek was both king of Salem and priest of God Most High. He was the one who went out and gave Abraham his blessing, when Abraham returned from killing the kings.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Then Abraham gave him a tenth of everything he had. The meaning of the name Melchizedek is &amp;apos;King of Justice.&amp;apos; But since Salem means &amp;apos;peace,&amp;apos; he is also &amp;apos;King of Peace.&amp;apos; &amp;apos;You are a priest forever, just like Melchizedek.&amp;apos; &amp;apos;I, the Lord, promise that you will be a priest forever! And I will never change my mind!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">We are not told he had a father or mother or ancestors or beginning or end. He is like the Son of God and will be a priest forever.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Notice how great Melchizedek was! Our famous ancestor Abraham gave him a tenth of what he had taken from his enemies.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">The Law teaches that even Abraham's descendants must give a tenth of what they possess. And they are to give this to their own relatives, who are the descendants of Levi and are priests.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Although Melchizedek wasn't a descendant of Levi, Abraham gave him a tenth of what he had. Then Melchizedek blessed Abraham, who had been given God's promise.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Everyone agrees a person who gives a blessing is greater than the one who receives the blessing.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Priests are given a tenth of what people earn. But all priests die, except Melchizedek, and the Scriptures teach that he is alive.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Levi's descendants are now the ones who receive a tenth from people. We could even say that when Abraham gave Melchizedek a tenth, Levi also gave him a tenth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">This is because Levi was born later into the family of Abraham, who gave a tenth to Melchizedek.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Even though the Law of Moses says the priests must be descendants of Levi, those priests cannot make anyone perfect. So there needs to be a priest like Melchizedek, rather than one from the priestly family of Aaron.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">And when the rules for selecting a priest are changed, the Law must also be changed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">The person we are talking about is our Lord, who came from a tribe that had never had anyone to serve as a priest at the altar.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Everyone knows he came from the tribe of Judah, and Moses never said priests would come from that tribe.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">All of this becomes clearer, when someone who is like Melchizedek is appointed to be a priest.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">That person wasn't appointed because of his ancestors, but because his life can never end.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">The Scriptures say about him,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">In this way a weak and useless command was put aside,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">because the Law cannot make anything perfect. At the same time, we are given a much better hope, and it can bring us close to God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">This means that Jesus guarantees us a better agreement with God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">There have been a lot of other priests, and all of them have died.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">But Jesus will never die, and so he will be a priest forever!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">He is forever able to save the people he leads to God, because he always lives to speak to God for them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">Jesus is the high priest we need. He is holy and innocent and faultless, and not at all like us sinners. Jesus is honored above all beings in heaven,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">and he is better than any other high priest. Jesus doesn't need to offer sacrifices each day for his own sins and then for the sins of the people. He offered a sacrifice once for all, when he gave himself.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">The Law appoints priests who have weaknesses. But God's promise, which came later than the Law, appoints his Son. And he is the perfect high priest forever.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="8">
			<VERS vnumber="1">What I mean is we have a high priest who sits at the right side of God's great throne in heaven.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">He also serves as the priest in the most holy place inside the real tent there in heaven. This tent of worship was set up by the Lord, not by humans. &amp;apos;I tell you the time will come, when I will make a new agreement with the people of Israel and the people of Judah. that I made with their ancestors, when I took them by the hand and led them out of Egypt. They broke their agreement with me, and I stopped caring about them! of Israel this is my new agreement: &amp;quot;The time will come when I, the Lord, will write my laws on their minds and hearts. I will be their God, and they will be my people. will have to teach another to know me, their Lord.&amp;quot; &amp;apos;All of them will know me, no matter who they are. even though they are wicked. I will forget their sins.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Since all priests must offer gifts and sacrifices, Christ also needed to have something to offer.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">If he were here on earth, he would not be a priest at all, because here the Law appoints other priests to offer sacrifices.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">But the tent where they serve is just a copy and a shadow of the real one in heaven. Before Moses made the tent, he was told, &amp;apos;Be sure to make it exactly like the pattern you were shown on the mountain!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Now Christ has been appointed to serve as a priest in a much better way, and he has given us much assurance of a better agreement.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">If the first agreement with God had been all right, there would not have been any need for another one.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">But the Lord found fault with it and said,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">It won't be like the agreement</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">&amp;apos;But now I tell the people</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Not one of them</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">I will treat them with kindness,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">When the Lord talks about a new agreement, he means that the first one is out of date. And anything that is old and useless will soon disappear.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="9">
			<VERS vnumber="1">The first promise included rules for worship and a tent for worship here on earth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">The first part of the tent was called the holy place, and a lampstand, a table, and the sacred loaves of bread were kept there. Now isn't the time to go into detail about these things.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Behind the curtain was the most holy place.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">The gold altar for burning incense was in this holy place. The gold-covered sacred chest was also there, and inside it were three things. First, there was a gold jar filled with manna. Then there was Aaron's walking stick that sprouted. Finally, there were the flat stones with the Ten Commandments written on them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">On top of the chest were the glorious creatures with wings opened out above the place of mercy.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">But this is how everything was when the priests went each day into the first part of the tent to do their duties.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">However, only the high priest could go into the second part of the tent, and he went in only once a year. Each time he carried blood to offer for his sins and for any sins that the people had committed without meaning to.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">All of this is the Holy Spirit's way of saying no one could enter the most holy place while the tent was still the place of worship.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">This also has a meaning for today. It shows we cannot make our consciences clear by offering gifts and sacrifices.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">These rules are merely about such things as eating and drinking and ceremonies for washing ourselves. And rules about physical things will last only until the time comes to change them for something better.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Christ came as the high priest of the good things that are now here. He also went into a much better tent that wasn't made by humans and that doesn't belong to this world.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Then Christ went once for all into the most holy place and freed us from sin forever. He did this by offering his own blood instead of the blood of goats and bulls.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">According to the Law of Moses, those people who become unclean are not fit to worship God. Yet they will be considered clean, if they are sprinkled with the blood of goats and bulls and with the ashes of a sacrificed calf.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">But Christ was sinless, and he offered himself as an eternal and spiritual sacrifice to God. This is why his blood is much more powerful and makes our consciences clear. Now we can serve the living God and no longer do things that lead to death.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Christ died to rescue those who had sinned and broken the old agreement. Now he brings his chosen ones a new agreement with its guarantee of God's eternal blessings!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">In fact, making an agreement of this kind is like writing a will. This is because the one who makes the will must die before it is of any use.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">In other words, a will doesn't go into effect as long as the one who made it is still alive.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Blood was also used to put the first agreement into effect.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Moses told the people all the Law said they must do. Then he used red wool and a hyssop plant to sprinkle the people and the book of the Law with the blood of bulls and goats and with water.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">He told the people, &amp;apos;With this blood God makes his agreement with you.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Moses also sprinkled blood on the tent and on everything else used in worship.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">The Law says that almost everything must be sprinkled with blood, and no sins can be forgiven unless blood is offered.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">These things are only copies of what is in heaven, and so they had to be made holy by these ceremonies. But the real things in heaven must be made holy by something better.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">This is why Christ did not go into a tent made by humans and was only a copy of the real one. Instead, he went into heaven and is now there with God to help us.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">Christ did not have to offer himself many times. He wasn't like a high priest who goes into the most holy place each year to offer the blood of an animal.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">If he had offered himself every year, he would have suffered many times since the creation of the world. But instead, near the end of time he offered himself once and for all, so he could be a sacrifice that does away with sin.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">We die only once, and then we are judged.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">So Christ died only once to take away the sins of many people. But when he comes again, it will not be to take away sin. He will come to save everyone who is waiting for him.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="10">
			<VERS vnumber="1">The Law of Moses is like a shadow of the good things to come. This shadow isn't the good things themselves, because it cannot free people from sin by the sacrifices offered year after year.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">If there were worshipers who already have their sins washed away and their consciences made clear, there would not be any need to go on offering sacrifices.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">When Christ came into the world, he said to God,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">No, you are not pleased</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Then Christ said,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">The Law teaches that offerings and sacrifices must be made because of sin. But why did Christ mention these things and say that God did not want them?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Well, it was to do away with offerings and sacrifices and to replace them. This is what he meant by saying to God, &amp;apos;I have come to do what you want.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">So we are made holy because Christ obeyed God and offered himself once for all.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">The priests do their work each day, and they keep on offering sacrifices that can never take away sins.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">But Christ offered himself as a sacrifice that is good forever. Now he is sitting at God's right side,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">and he will stay there until his enemies are put under his power.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">By his one sacrifice he has forever set free from sin the people he brings to God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">The Holy Spirit also speaks of this by telling us that the Lord said,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">&amp;apos;When the time comes,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Then I will forget</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">When sins are forgiven, there is no more need to offer sacrifices.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">My friends, the blood of Jesus gives us courage to enter the most holy place</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">by a new way that leads to life! And this way takes us through the curtain that is Christ himself.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">We have a great high priest who is in charge of God's house.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">So let's come near God with pure hearts and a confidence that comes from having faith. Let's keep our hearts pure, our consciences free from evil, and our bodies washed with clean water.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">We must hold tightly to the hope we say is ours. After all, we can trust the one who made the agreement with us.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">We should keep on encouraging each other to be thoughtful and to do helpful things.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">Some people have given up the habit of meeting for worship, but we must not do that. We should keep on encouraging each other, especially since you know that the day of the Lord's coming is getting closer.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">No sacrifices can be made for people who decide to sin after they find out about the truth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">They are God's enemies, and all they can look forward to is a terrible judgment and a furious fire.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">If two or more witnesses accused someone of breaking the Law of Moses, that person could be put to death.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">But it is much worse to dishonor God's Son and to disgrace the blood of the promise that made us holy. And it is just as bad to insult the Holy Spirit, who shows us mercy.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">We know that God has said he will punish and take revenge. We also know that the Scriptures say the Lord will judge his people.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">It is a terrible thing to fall into the hands of the living God!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">Don't forget all the hard times you went through when you first received the light.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">Sometimes you were abused and mistreated in public, and at other times you shared in the sufferings of others.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">You were kind to people in jail. And you gladly let your possessions be taken away, because you knew you had something better, something that would last forever.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">Keep on being brave! It will bring you great rewards.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">Learn to be patient, so you will please God and be given what he has promised.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">As the Scriptures say,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">The people God accepts of their faith.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">We are not like those people who turn back and get destroyed. We will keep on having faith until we are saved.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="11">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Faith makes us sure of what we hope for and gives us proof of what we cannot see.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">It was their faith that made our ancestors pleasing to God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Because of our faith, we know that the world was made at God's command. We also know that what can be seen was made out of what cannot be seen.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Because Abel had faith, he offered God a better sacrifice than Cain did. God was pleased with him and his gift, and even though Abel is now dead, his faith still speaks for him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Enoch had faith and did not die. He pleased God, and God took him up to heaven. This is why his body was never found.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">But without faith no one can please God. We must believe that God is real and rewards everyone who searches for him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Because Noah had faith, he was warned about something that had not yet happened. He obeyed and built a boat that saved him and his family. In this way the people of the world were judged, and Noah was given the blessings that come to everyone who pleases God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Abraham had faith and obeyed God. He was told to go to the land that God had said would be his, and he left for a country he had never seen.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Because Abraham had faith, he lived as a stranger in the promised land. He lived there in a tent, and so did Isaac and Jacob, who were later given the same promise.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Abraham did this, because he was waiting for the eternal city God had planned and built.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Even when Sarah was too old to have children, she had faith that God would do what he had promised, and she had a son.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Her husband Abraham was almost dead, but he became the ancestor of many people. In fact, there are as many of them as there are stars in the sky or grains of sand along the seashore.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Every one of those people died. But they still had faith, even though they had not received what they had been promised. They were glad just to see these things from far away, and they agreed that they were only strangers and foreigners on this earth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">When people talk this way, it is clear they are looking for a place to call their own.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">If they had been talking about the land where they had once lived, they could have gone back at any time.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">But they were looking forward to a better home in heaven. This is why God wasn't ashamed for them to call him their God. He even built a city for them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">because he was sure that God could raise people to life. This was just like getting Isaac back from death.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Isaac had faith, and he promised blessings to Jacob and Esau.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Later, when Jacob was about to die, he leaned on his walking stick and worshiped. Then because of his faith he blessed each of Joseph's sons.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">And right before Joseph died, he had faith that God would lead the people of Israel out of Egypt. So he told them to take his bones with them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">Because Moses' parents had faith, they kept him hidden until he was three months old. They saw that he was a beautiful child, and they were not afraid to disobey the king's orders.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">Then after Moses grew up, his faith made him refuse to be called the king's grandson.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">He chose to be mistreated with God's people instead of having the good time that sin could bring for a little while.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">Moses knew that the treasures of Egypt were not as wonderful as what he would receive from suffering for the Messiah, and he looked forward to his reward.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">Because of his faith, Moses left Egypt. Moses had seen the invisible God and wasn't afraid of the king's anger.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">His faith also made him celebrate Passover. He sprinkled the blood of animals on the doorposts, so that the first-born sons of the people of Israel would not be killed by the destroying angel.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">Because of their faith, the people walked through the Red Sea on dry land. But when the Egyptians tried to do it, they were drowned.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">God's people had faith, and when they had walked around the city of Jericho for seven days, its walls fell down.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">Rahab had been a prostitute, but she had faith and welcomed the spies. So she wasn't killed with the people who disobeyed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">What else can I say? There isn't enough time to tell about Gideon, Barak, Samson, Jephthah, David, Samuel, and the prophets.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">Their faith helped them conquer kingdoms, and because they did right, God made promises to them. They closed the jaws of lions</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">and put out raging fires and escaped from the swords of their enemies. Although they were weak, they were given the strength and power to chase foreign armies away.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">Some women received their loved ones back from death. Many of these people were tortured, but they refused to be released. They were sure they would get a better reward when the dead are raised to life.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">Others were made fun of and beaten with whips, and some were chained in jail.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">Still others were stoned to death or sawed in two or killed with swords. Some had nothing but sheep skins or goat skins to wear. They were poor, mistreated, and tortured.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">The world did not deserve these good people, who had to wander in deserts and on mountains and had to live in caves and holes in the ground.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">All of them pleased God because of their faith! But still they died without being given what had been promised.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">This was because God had something better in store for us. And he did not want them to reach the goal of their faith without us.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="12">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Such a large crowd of witnesses is all around us! So we must get rid of everything that slows us down, especially the sin that just won't let go. And we must be determined to run the race that is ahead of us.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">We must keep our eyes on Jesus, who leads us and makes our faith complete. He endured the shame of being nailed to a cross, because he knew later on he would be glad he did. Now he is seated at the right side of God's throne!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">So keep your mind on Jesus, who put up with many insults from sinners. Then you won't get discouraged and give up. &amp;apos;When the Lord punishes you, don't make light of it, and when he corrects you, don't be discouraged. he loves and disciplines those he calls his own.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">None of you have yet been hurt in your battle against sin.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">But you have forgotten that the Scriptures say to God's children,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">The Lord corrects the people</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Be patient when you are being corrected! This is how God treats his children. Don't all parents correct their children?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">God corrects all his children, and if he doesn't correct you, then you don't really belong to him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Our earthly fathers correct us, and we still respect them. Isn't it even better to be given true life by letting our spiritual Father correct us?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Our human fathers correct us for a short time, and they do it as they think best. But God corrects us for our own good, because he wants us to be holy, as he is.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">It is never fun to be corrected. In fact, at the time it is always painful. But if we learn to obey by being corrected, we will do right and live at peace.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Now stand up straight! Stop your knees from shaking</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">and walk a straight path. Then lame people will be healed, instead of getting worse.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Try to live at peace with everyone! Live a clean life. If you don't, you will never see the Lord.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Make sure no one misses out on God's wonderful kindness. Don't let anyone become bitter and cause trouble for the rest of you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Watch out for immoral and ungodly people like Esau, who sold his future blessing for only one meal.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">You know how he later wanted it back. But there was nothing he could do to change things, even though he begged his father and cried.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">You have not come to a place like Mount Sinai that can be seen and touched. There is no flaming fire or dark cloud or storm</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">or trumpet sound. The people of Israel heard a voice speak. But they begged it to stop,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">because they could not obey its commands. They were even told to kill any animal that touched the mountain.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">The sight was so frightening that Moses said he shook with fear.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">You have now come to Mount Zion and to the heavenly Jerusalem. This is the city of the living God, where thousands and thousands of angels have come to celebrate.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">Here you will find all of God's dearest children, whose names are written in heaven. And you will find God himself, who judges everyone. Here also are the spirits of those good people who have been made perfect.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">And Jesus is here! He is the one who makes God's new agreement with us, and his sprinkled blood says much better things than the blood of Abel.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">Make sure you obey the one who speaks to you. The people did not escape, when they refused to obey the one who spoke to them at Mount Sinai. Do you think you can possibly escape, if you refuse to obey the one who speaks to you from heaven?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">When God spoke the first time, his voice shook only the earth. This time he has promised to shake the earth once again, and heaven too.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">The words &amp;apos;once again&amp;apos; mean that these created things will someday be shaken and removed. Then what cannot be shaken will last.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">We should be grateful we were given a kingdom that cannot be shaken. And in this kingdom we please God by worshiping him and by showing him great honor and respect.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1">Keep being concerned about each other as the Lord's followers should. &amp;apos;The Lord helps me! Why should I be afraid of what people can do to me?&amp;apos; His followers from Italy send you their greetings.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Be sure to welcome strangers into your home. By doing this, some people have welcomed angels as guests, without even knowing it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Remember the Lord's people who are in jail and be concerned for them. Don't forget those who are suffering, but imagine you are there with them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Have respect for marriage. Always be faithful to your partner, because God will punish anyone who is immoral or unfaithful in marriage.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Don't fall in love with money. Be satisfied with what you have. The Lord has promised that he will not leave us or desert us.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">This should make you feel like saying,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Don't forget about your leaders who taught you God's message. Remember what kind of lives they lived and try to have faith like theirs.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Jesus Christ never changes! He is the same yesterday, today, and forever.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Don't be fooled by any kind of strange teachings. It is better to receive strength from God's gift of undeserved grace than to depend on certain foods. After all, these foods don't really help the people who eat them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">But we have an altar where even the priests who serve in the place of worship have no right to eat.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">After the high priest offers the blood of animals as a sin offering, the bodies of those animals are burned outside the camp.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Jesus himself suffered outside the city gate, so his blood would make people holy.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="19">I especially want you to pray that I can visit you again soon.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1">From James, a servant of God and of our Lord Jesus Christ. Greetings to the twelve tribes scattered all over the world.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">My friends, be glad, even if you have a lot of trouble.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">You know you learn to endure by having your faith tested.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">But you must learn to endure everything, so you will be completely mature and not lacking in anything.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">If any of you need wisdom, you should ask God, and it will be given to you. God is generous and won't correct you for asking.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">But when you ask for something, you must have faith and not doubt. Anyone who doubts is like an ocean wave tossed around in a storm.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Any of God's people who are poor should be glad he thinks so highly of them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">But any who are rich should be glad when God makes them humble. Rich people will disappear like wild flowers</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">scorched by the burning heat of the sun. The flowers lose their blossoms, and their beauty is destroyed. This is how the rich will disappear, as they go about their business.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">God will bless you, if you don't give up when your faith is being tested. He will reward you with a glorious life, just as he rewards everyone who loves him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Don't blame God when you are tempted! God cannot be tempted by evil, and he doesn't use evil to tempt others.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">We are tempted by our own desires that drag us off and trap us.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Our desires make us sin, and when sin is finished with us, it leaves us dead.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Don't be fooled, my dear friends.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Every good and perfect gift comes down from the Father who created all the lights in the heavens. He is always the same and never makes dark shadows by changing.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">He wanted us to be his own special people, and so he sent the true message to give us new birth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">My dear friends, you should be quick to listen and slow to speak or to get angry.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">If you are angry, you cannot do any of the good things God wants done.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">You must stop doing anything immoral or evil. Instead be humble and accept the message planted in you to save you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Obey God's message! Don't fool yourselves by just listening to it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">If you hear the message and don't obey it, you are like people who stare at themselves in a mirror</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">and forget what they look like as soon as they leave.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">But you must never stop looking at the perfect law that sets you free. God will bless you in everything you do, if you listen and obey, and don't just hear and forget.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">If you think you are being religious, but can't control your tongue, you are fooling yourself, and your religion is useless.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">Religion that pleases God the Father must be pure and spotless. You must help needy orphans and widows and not let this world make you evil.</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="2">
			<VERS vnumber="1">My friends, if you have faith in our glorious Lord Jesus Christ, you won't treat some people better than others.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Suppose a rich person wearing fancy clothes and a gold ring comes to one of your meetings. And suppose a poor person dressed in worn-out clothes also comes.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">You must not give the best seat to the one in fancy clothes and tell the one who is poor to stand at the side or sit on the floor.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">This is the same as saying that some people are better than others, and you would be acting like a crooked judge. I would answer, &amp;apos;Prove that you have faith without doing kind deeds, and I will prove that I have faith by doing them.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">My dear friends, pay attention. God has given a lot of faith to the poor people in this world. God has also promised them a share in his kingdom that he will give to everyone who loves him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">You mistreat the poor. But isn't it the rich who boss you around and drag you off to court?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Aren't they the ones who make fun of your Lord?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">You will do all right, if you obey the most important law in the Scriptures. It is the law that commands us to love others as much as we love ourselves.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">But if you treat some people better than others, you have done wrong, and the Scriptures teach that you have sinned.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">If you obey every law except one, you are still guilty of breaking them all.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">The same God who told us to be faithful in marriage also told us not to murder. So even if you are faithful in marriage, but murder someone, you still have broken God's Law.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Speak and act like people who will be judged by the law that sets us free.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Do this, because on the day of judgment there will be no pity for those who have not had pity on others. But even in judgment, God is merciful!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">My friends, what good is it to say you have faith, when you don't do anything to show you really do have faith? Can this kind of faith save you?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">If you know someone who doesn't have any clothes or food,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">you shouldn't just say, &amp;apos;I hope all goes well for you. I hope you will be warm and have plenty to eat.&amp;apos; What good is it to say this, unless you do something to help?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Faith that doesn't lead us to do good deeds is all alone and dead!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Suppose someone disagrees and says, &amp;apos;It is possible to have faith without doing kind deeds.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">You surely believe there is only one God. That's fine. Even demons believe this, and it makes them shake with fear.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Does some stupid person want proof that faith without deeds is useless?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Well, our ancestor Abraham pleased God by putting his son Isaac on the altar to sacrifice him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Now you see how Abraham's faith and deeds worked together. He proved his faith was real by what he did.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">This is what the Scriptures mean by saying, &amp;apos;Abraham had faith in God, and God accepted him.&amp;apos; That's how Abraham became God's friend.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">You can now see that we please God by what we do and not only by what we believe.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">For example, Rahab had been a prostitute. But she pleased God when she welcomed the spies and sent them home by another way.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">Anyone who doesn't breathe is dead, and faith that doesn't do anything is just as dead!</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="3">
			<VERS vnumber="1">My friends, we should not all try to become teachers. In fact, teachers will be judged more strictly than others.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">All of us do many wrong things. But if you can control your tongue, you are mature and able to control your whole body. It takes only a spark to start a forest fire!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">By putting a bit into the mouth of a horse, we can turn the horse in different directions.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">It takes strong winds to move a large sailing ship, but the captain uses only a small rudder to make it go in any direction.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Our tongues are small too, and yet they brag about big things.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">The tongue is like a spark. It is an evil power that dirties the rest of the body and sets a person's entire life on fire with flames that come from hell itself.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">All kinds of animals, birds, reptiles, and sea creatures can be tamed and have been tamed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">But our tongues get out of control. They are restless and evil, and always spreading deadly poison.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Can clean water and dirty water both flow from the same spring?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Can a fig tree produce olives or a grapevine produce figs? Does fresh water come from a well full of salt water?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Are any of you wise or sensible? Then show it by living right and by being humble and wise in everything you do.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">But if your heart is full of bitter jealousy and selfishness, don't brag or lie to cover up the truth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">This kind of wisdom doesn't come from above. It is earthly and selfish and comes from the devil himself.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Whenever people are jealous or selfish, they cause trouble and do all sorts of cruel things.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">But the wisdom that comes from above leads us to be pure, friendly, gentle, sensible, kind, helpful, genuine, and sincere.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">When peacemakers plant seeds of peace, they will harvest justice.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="4">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Why do you fight and argue with each other? Isn't it because you are full of selfish desires that fight to control your body?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">You want something you don't have, and you will do anything to get it. You will even kill! But you still cannot get what you want, and you won't get it by fighting and arguing. You should pray for it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Yet even when you do pray, your prayers are not answered, because you pray just for selfish reasons. &amp;apos;God opposes everyone who is proud, but he blesses all who are humble with undeserved grace.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">You people aren't faithful to God! Don't you know if you love the world, you are God's enemies? And if you decide to be a friend of the world, you make yourself an enemy of God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Do you doubt the Scriptures that say, &amp;apos;God truly cares about the Spirit he has put in us&amp;apos;?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">In fact, God treats us with even greater kindness, just as the Scriptures say,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Surrender to God! Resist the devil, and he will run from you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Come near to God, and he will come near to you. Clean up your lives, you sinners. Purify your hearts, you people who can't make up your mind.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Be sad and sorry and weep. Stop laughing and start crying. Be gloomy instead of glad.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Be humble in the Lord's presence, and he will honor you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">My friends, don't say cruel things about others! If you do, or if you condemn others, you are condemning God's Law. And if you condemn the Law, you put yourself above the Law and refuse to obey either it</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">or God who gave it. God is our judge, and he can save or destroy us. What right do you have to condemn anyone?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">You should know better than to say, &amp;apos;Today or tomorrow we will go to the city. We will do business there for a year and make a lot of money!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">What do you know about tomorrow? How can you be so sure about your life? It is nothing more than mist that appears for only a little while before it disappears.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">You should say, &amp;apos;If the Lord lets us live, we will do these things.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Yet you are stupid enough to brag, and it is wrong to be so proud.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">If you don't do what you know is right, you have sinned.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="5">
			<VERS vnumber="1">You rich people should cry and weep! Terrible things are going to happen to you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Your treasures have already rotted, and moths have eaten your clothes.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Your money has rusted, and the rust will be evidence against you, as it burns your body like fire. Yet you keep on storing up wealth in these last days.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">You refused to pay the people who worked in your fields, and now their unpaid wages are shouting out against you. The Lord All-Powerful has surely heard the cries of the workers who harvested your crops.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">While here on earth, you have thought only of filling your own stomachs and having a good time. But now you are like fat cattle on their way to be butchered.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">You have condemned and murdered innocent people, who couldn't even fight back.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">My friends, be patient until the Lord returns. Think of farmers who wait patiently for the autumn and spring rains to make their valuable crops grow.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Be patient like those farmers and don't give up. The Lord will soon be here!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Don't grumble about each other or you will be judged, and the judge is right outside the door.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">My friends, follow the example of the prophets who spoke for the Lord. They were patient, even when they had to suffer.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">In fact, we praise the ones who endured the most. You remember how patient Job was and how the Lord finally helped him. The Lord did this because he is so merciful and kind.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">My friends, above all else, don't take an oath. You must not swear by heaven or by earth or by anything else. &amp;apos;Yes&amp;apos; or &amp;apos;No&amp;apos; is all you need to say. If you say anything more, you will be condemned.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">If you are having trouble, you should pray. And if you are feeling good, you should sing praises.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">If you are sick, ask the church leaders to come and pray for you. Ask them to put olive oil on you in the name of the Lord.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">If you have faith when you pray for sick people, they will get well. The Lord will heal them, and if they have sinned, he will forgive them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">If you have sinned, you should tell each other what you have done. Then you can pray for one another and be healed. The prayer of an innocent person is powerful, and it can help a lot.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Elijah was just as human as we are, and for three and a half years his prayers kept the rain from falling.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">But when he did pray for rain, it fell from the skies and made the crops grow.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">My friends, if any followers have wandered away from the truth, you should try to lead them back.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">If you turn sinners from the wrong way, you will save them from death, and many of their sins will be forgiven.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="19">Christ then preached to the spirits that were being kept in prison.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">They had disobeyed God while Noah was building the boat, but God had been patient with them. Eight people went into that boat and were brought safely through the flood.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Those flood waters were like baptism that now saves you. But baptism is more than just washing your body. It means turning to God with a clear conscience, because Jesus Christ was raised from death.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Christ is now in heaven, where he sits at the right side of God. All angels, authorities, and powers are under his control.</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="4">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Christ suffered here on earth. Now you must be ready to suffer as he did, because suffering shows that you have stopped sinning.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">It means you have turned from your own desires and want to obey God for the rest of your life.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">You have already lived long enough like people who don't know God. You were immoral and followed your evil desires. You went around drinking and partying and carrying on. In fact, you even worshiped disgusting idols.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Now your former friends wonder why you have stopped running around with them, and they curse you for it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">But they will have to answer to God, who judges the living and the dead.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">The good news has even been preached to the dead, so that after they have been judged for what they have done in this life, their spirits will live with God. what will happen to sinners and to others who don't respect God?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Everything will soon come to an end. So be serious and be sensible enough to pray.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="11">If you have the gift of speaking, preach God's message. If you have the gift of helping others, do it with the strength that God supplies. Everything should be done in a way that will bring honor to God because of Jesus Christ, who is glorious and powerful forever. Amen.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="14">Count it a blessing when you suffer for being a Christian. This shows that God's glorious Spirit is with you.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="17">God has already begun judging his own people. And if his judgment begins with us, imagine how terrible it will be for those who refuse to obey his message. The Scriptures say,</VERS>

I too am a leader, as well as a witness to Christ's suffering, and I will share in his glory when it is shown to us. &amp;apos;God opposes proud people, but he helps everyone who is humble.&amp;apos; Mark, who is like a son to me, sends his greetings too.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Just as shepherds watch over their sheep, you must watch over everyone God has placed in your care. Do it willingly in order to please God, and not simply because you think you must. Let it be something you want to do, instead of something you do merely to make money.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="3">We have everything we need to live a life that pleases God. It was all given to us by God's own power, when we learned he had invited us to share in his wonderful goodness.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">God made great and marvelous promises, so his nature would become part of us. Then we could escape our evil desires and the corrupt influences of this world.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Do your best to improve your faith by adding goodness, understanding,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">self-control, patience, devotion to God,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">concern for others, and love.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">If you keep growing in this way, it will show that what you know about our Lord Jesus Christ has made your lives useful and meaningful.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">But if you don't grow, you are like someone who is nearsighted or blind, and you have forgotten that your past sins are forgiven.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">My friends, you must do all you can to show God has really chosen and selected you. If you keep on doing this, you won't stumble and fall.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Then our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ will give you a glorious welcome into his kingdom that will last forever.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">You are holding firmly to the truth you were given. But I am still going to remind you of these things.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="14">And our Lord Jesus Christ has already told me that I will soon leave it behind.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">This is why I am doing my best to make sure that each of you remembers all of this after I am gone.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">When we told you about the power and the return of our Lord Jesus Christ, we were not telling clever stories someone had made up. But with our own eyes we saw his true greatness.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">God, our great and wonderful Father, truly honored him by saying, &amp;apos;This is my own dear Son, and I am pleased with him.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">We were there with Jesus on the holy mountain and heard this voice speak from heaven.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">All of this makes us even more certain that what the prophets said is true. So you should pay close attention to their message, as you would to a lamp shining in some dark place. You must keep on paying attention until daylight comes and the morning star rises in your hearts.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">But you need to realize that no one alone can understand any of the prophecies in the Scriptures.</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="2">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Sometimes false prophets spoke to the people of Israel. False teachers will also sneak in and speak harmful lies to you. But these teachers don't really belong to the Master who paid a great price for them, and they will quickly destroy themselves.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Many people will follow their evil ways and cause others to tell lies about the true way.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">They will be greedy and cheat you with smooth talk. But long ago God decided to punish them, and God doesn't sleep. &amp;apos;A dog will come back to lick up its own vomit. A pig that has been washed will roll in the mud.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">God did not have pity on the angels that sinned. He had them tied up and thrown into the dark pits of hell until the time of judgment.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">And during Noah's time, God did not have pity on the ungodly people of the world. He destroyed them with a flood, though he did save eight people, including Noah, who preached the truth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">God punished the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah by burning them to ashes, and this is a warning to anyone else who wants to sin.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">This shows that the Lord knows how to rescue godly people from their sufferings and to punish evil people while they wait for the day of judgment.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">The Lord is especially hard on people who disobey him and don't think of anything except their own filthy desires. They are reckless and proud and are not afraid of cursing the glorious beings in heaven.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Although angels are more powerful than these evil beings, even the angels don't dare to accuse them to the Lord.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">These people are no better than senseless animals that live by their feelings and are born to be caught and killed. They speak evil of things they don't know anything about. But their own corrupt deeds will destroy them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">They have done evil, and they will be rewarded with evil. They think it is fun to have wild parties during the day. They are immoral, and the meals they eat with you are spoiled by the shameful and selfish way they carry on.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">All they think about is having sex with someone else's husband or wife. There is no end to their wicked deeds. They trick people who are easily fooled, and their minds are filled with greedy thoughts. But they are headed for trouble!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">They have left the true road and have gone down the wrong path by following the example of the prophet Balaam. He was the son of Beor and loved what he got from being a crook.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">But a donkey corrected him for this evil deed. It spoke to him with a human voice and made him stop his foolishness.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">These people are like dried up water holes and clouds blown by a windstorm. The darkest part of hell is waiting for them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">They brag out loud about their stupid nonsense. And by being vulgar and crude, they trap people who have barely escaped from living the wrong kind of life.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">They promise freedom to everyone. But they are merely slaves of filthy living, because people are slaves of whatever controls them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">When they learned about our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, they escaped from the filthy things of this world. But they are again caught up and controlled by these filthy things, and now they are in worse shape than they were at first.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">They would have been better off if they had never known about the right way. Even after they knew what was right, they turned their backs on the holy commandments they were given.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1">My dear friends, this is the second letter I have written to encourage you to do some honest thinking. I don't want you to forget</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">what God's prophets said would happen. You must never forget what the holy prophets taught in the past. And you must remember what the apostles told you our Lord and Savior has commanded us to do.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">But first you must realize that in the last days some people won't think about anything except their own selfish desires. They will make fun of you</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">and say, &amp;apos;Didn't your Lord promise to come back? Yet the first leaders have already died, and the world hasn't changed a bit.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">They will say this because they want to forget that long ago the heavens and the earth were made at God's command. The earth came out of water and was made from water.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Later it was destroyed by the waters of a mighty flood.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">But God has commanded the present heavens and earth to remain until the day of judgment. Then they will be set on fire, and ungodly people will be destroyed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Dear friends, don't forget that for the Lord one day is the same as 1,000 years, and 1,000 years is the same as one day.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">The Lord isn't slow about keeping his promises, as some people think he is. In fact, God is patient, because he wants everyone to turn from sin and no one to be lost.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">The day of the Lord's return will surprise us like a thief. The heavens will disappear with a loud noise, and the heat will melt the whole universe. Then the earth and everything on it will be seen for what they are.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Everything will be destroyed. So you should serve and honor God by the way you live.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">You should look forward to the day when God judges everyone, and you should try to make it come soon. On that day the heavens will be destroyed by fire, and everything else will melt in the heat.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">But God has promised us a new heaven and a new earth, where justice will rule. We are really looking forward to this!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">My friends, while you are waiting, you should make certain the Lord finds you pure, spotless, and living at peace.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Don't forget that the Lord is patient because he wants people to be saved. This is also what our dear friend Paul said when he wrote you with the wisdom God had given him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Paul talks about these same things in all his letters, but part of what he says is hard to understand. Some ignorant and unsteady people even destroy themselves by twisting what he said. They do the same thing with other Scriptures too.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">My dear friends, you have been warned ahead of time! So don't let the errors of evil people lead you down the wrong path and make you lose your balance.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Let the gift of undeserved grace and the understanding that come from our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ help you keep on growing. Praise Jesus now and forever! Amen.</VERS>

Young people, I am writing you, because you have defeated the evil one. because you have known the Father. Parents, I am writing you, because you have known the one who was there from the beginning. Young people, I am writing you, because you are strong. God's message is firm in your hearts, and you have defeated the evil one.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="9">God showed his love for us when he sent his only Son into the world to give us life.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="10">If we have faith in God's Son, we have believed what God has said. But if we don't believe what God has said about his Son, it is the same as calling God a liar.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">God has also said he gave us eternal life and this life comes to us from his Son.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="2">I pray that God will greatly bless you with mercy, peace, and love!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">My dear friends, I really wanted to write you about God's saving power at work in our lives. But instead, I must write and ask you to defend the faith that God has once for all given to his people.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Some godless people have sneaked in among us and are saying, &amp;apos;God treats us much better than we deserve, and so it is all right to be immoral.&amp;apos; They even deny we must obey Jesus Christ as our only Master and Lord. But long ago the Scriptures warned that these godless people were doomed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Don't forget what happened to those people the Lord rescued from Egypt. Some of them did not have faith, and he later destroyed them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">You also know about the angels who didn't do their work and left their proper places. God chained them with everlasting chains and is now keeping them in dark pits until the great day of judgment.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">We should also be warned by what happened to the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah and the nearby towns. Their people became immoral and committed all sorts of sexual sins. Then God made an example of them and punished them with eternal fire.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">The people I am talking about are behaving just like those dreamers who destroyed their own bodies. They reject all authority and insult angels.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Even Michael, the chief angel, didn't dare to insult the devil, when the two of them were arguing about the body of Moses. All Michael said was, &amp;apos;The Lord will punish you!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">But these people insult powers they don't know anything about. They are like senseless animals that end up getting destroyed, because they live only by their feelings.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Now they are in for real trouble. They have followed Cain's example and have made the same mistake that Balaam did by caring only for money. They have also rebelled against God, just as Korah did. Because of all this, they will be destroyed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">These people are filthy minded, and by their shameful and selfish actions they spoil the meals you eat together. They are like clouds blown along by the wind, but never bringing any rain. They are like leafless trees, uprooted and dead, and unable to produce fruit.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Their shameful deeds show up like foam on wild ocean waves. They are like wandering stars forever doomed to the darkest pits of hell.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Enoch was the seventh person after Adam, and he was talking about these people when he said:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">to judge everyone. He will punish all those ungodly people for all the evil things they have done. The Lord will surely punish those ungodly sinners for every evil thing they have ever said about him.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="20">Dear friends, keep building on the foundation of your most holy faith, as the Holy Spirit helps you to pray.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">And keep in step with God's love, as you wait for our Lord Jesus Christ to show how kind he is by giving you eternal life.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Be helpful to all who may have doubts.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">Rescue any who need to be saved, as you would rescue someone from a fire. Then with fear in your own hearts, have mercy on everyone who needs it. But hate even the clothes of those who have been made dirty by their filthy deeds.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="10">On the Lord's day the Spirit took control of me, and behind me I heard a loud voice that sounded like a trumpet.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">The voice said, &amp;apos;Write in a book what you see. Then send it to the seven churches in Ephesus, Smyrna, Pergamum, Thyatira, Sardis, Philadelphia, and Laodicea.&amp;apos;</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="13">There with the lampstands was someone who seemed to be the Son of Man. He was wearing a robe that reached down to his feet, and a gold cloth was wrapped around his chest.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">His head and his hair were white as wool or snow, and his eyes looked like flames of fire.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="19">Write what you have seen and what is and what will happen after these things.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">I will explain the mystery of the seven stars you saw at my right side and the seven gold lampstands. The seven stars are the angels of the seven churches, and the lampstands are the seven churches.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="2">
			<VERS vnumber="1">This is what you must write to the angel of the church in Ephesus: I am the one who holds the seven stars in my right hand, and I walk among the seven gold lampstands. Listen to what I say. I am the first and the last. I died, but now I am alive! Listen to what I say. I am the one who has the sharp double-edged sword! Listen to what I say. I am the Son of God! My eyes are like flames of fire, and my feet are like bronze. Listen to what I say.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">I know everything you have done, including your hard work and how you have endured. I know you won't put up with anyone who is evil. When some people pretended to be apostles, you tested them and found out they were liars.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">You have endured and gone through hard times because of me, yet you have not given up.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">But I do have something against you! And it is this: You don't have as much love as you used to.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Think about where you have fallen from, and then turn back and do as you did at first. If you don't turn back, I will come and take away your lampstand.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">But there is one thing you are doing right. You hate what the Nicolaitans are doing, and so do I.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">If you have ears, listen to what the Spirit says to the churches. I will let everyone who wins the victory eat from the life-giving tree in God's wonderful garden.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">This is what you must write to the angel of the church in Smyrna:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">I know how much you suffer and how poor you are, but you are rich. I also know the cruel things being said about you by people who claim to be God's people. But they are not really God's people. They are a group that belongs to Satan.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Don't worry about what you will suffer. The devil will throw some of you into jail, and you will be tested and made to suffer for ten days. But if you are faithful until you die, I will reward you with a glorious life.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">If you have ears, listen to what the Spirit says to the churches. Whoever wins the victory will not be hurt by the second death.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">This is what you must write to the angel of the church in Pergamum:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">I know you live where Satan has his throne. But you have kept true to my name. Right there where Satan lives, my faithful witness Antipas was taken from you and put to death. Even then you did not give up your faith in me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">I do have a few things against you. Some of you are following the teaching of Balaam. Long ago he told Balak to teach the people of Israel to eat food that had been offered to idols and to be immoral.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Now some of you are following the teaching of the Nicolaitans.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Turn back! If you don't, I will come quickly and fight against these people. And my words will cut like a sword.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">If you have ears, listen to what the Spirit says to the churches. To everyone who wins the victory, I will give some of the hidden food. I will also give each one a white stone with a new name written on it. No one will know that name except the one who is given the stone.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">This is what you must write to the angel of the church in Thyatira:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">I know everything about you, including your love, your faith, your service, and how you have endured. I know you are doing more now than you have ever done before.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">But I still have something against you because of that woman Jezebel. She calls herself a prophet, and you let her teach and mislead my servants to do immoral things and to eat food offered to idols.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">I gave her a chance to turn from her sins, but she did not want to stop doing these immoral things.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">I am going to strike down Jezebel. Everyone who does these immoral things with her will also be punished, if they don't stop.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">I will even kill her followers. Then all the churches will see that I know everyone's thoughts and feelings. I will treat each of you as you deserve.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">Some of you in Thyatira don't follow Jezebel's teaching. You don't know anything about what her followers call the &amp;apos;deep secrets of Satan.&amp;apos; So I won't burden you down with any other commands.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">But until I come, you must hold firmly to the teaching you have.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">I will give power over the nations to everyone who wins the victory and keeps on obeying me until the end.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">If you have ears, listen to what the Spirit says to the churches.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="3">
			<VERS vnumber="1">This is what you must write to the angel of the church in Sardis: I have the seven spirits of God and the seven stars. Listen to what I say. I know what you are doing. Everyone may think you are alive, but you are dead.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Wake up! You have only a little strength left, and it is almost gone. So try to become stronger. I have found that you are not completely obeying God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Remember the teaching you were given and heard. Hold firmly to it and turn from your sins. If you don't wake up, I will come when you least expect it, just as a thief does.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">A few of you in Sardis have not dirtied your clothes with sin. You will walk with me in white clothes, because you are worthy.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Everyone who wins the victory will wear white clothes. Their names will not be erased from the book of life, and I will tell my Father and his angels that they are my followers.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">If you have ears, listen to what the Spirit says to the churches.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">This is what you must write to the angel of the church in Philadelphia: I am the one who is holy and true, and I have the keys that belonged to David. When I open a door, no one can close it. And when I close a door, no one can open it. Listen to what I say. I am the one called Amen! I am the faithful and true witness and the source of God's creation. Listen to what I say.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">I know everything you have done. And I have placed before you an open door no one can close. You were not very strong, but you obeyed my message and did not deny you are my followers.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Now you will see what I will do with those people who belong to Satan's group. They claim to be God's people, but they are liars. I will make them come and kneel down at your feet. Then they will know that I love you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">You obeyed my message and endured. So I will protect you from the time of testing everyone in all the world must go through.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">I am coming soon. So hold firmly to what you have, and no one will take away the crown you will be given as your reward.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Everyone who wins the victory will be made into a pillar in the temple of my God, and they will stay there forever. I will write on each of them the name of my God and the name of his city. It is the new Jerusalem my God will send down from heaven. I will also write on them my own new name.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">If you have ears, listen to what the Spirit says to the churches.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">This is what you must write to the angel of the church in Laodicea:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">I know everything you have done, and you are not cold or hot. I wish you were either one or the other.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">But since you are lukewarm and neither cold nor hot, I will spit you out of my mouth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">You claim to be rich and successful and to have everything you need. But you don't know how bad off you really are. You are pitiful, poor, blind, and naked.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Buy your gold from me. It has been refined in a fire, and it will make you rich. Buy white clothes from me. Wear them and you can cover up your shameful nakedness. Buy medicine for your eyes, so you will be able to see.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">I correct and punish everyone I love. So make up your minds to turn away from your sins.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Listen! I am standing and knocking at your door. If you hear my voice and open the door, I will come in and we will eat together.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Everyone who wins the victory will sit with me on my throne, just as I won the victory and sat with my Father on his throne.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">If you have ears, listen to what the Spirit says to the churches.</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="4">
			<VERS vnumber="1">After this, I looked and saw a door that opened into heaven. Then the voice that had spoken to me at first and that sounded like a trumpet said, &amp;apos;Come up here! I will show you what must happen next.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Right then the Spirit took control of me, and there in heaven I saw a throne and someone sitting on it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">The one who was sitting there sparkled like precious stones of jasper and carnelian. A rainbow that looked like an emerald surrounded the throne. Around the throne in the center were four living creatures covered front and back with eyes. &amp;apos;Holy, holy, holy is the Lord, the all-powerful God, who was and is and is coming!&amp;apos; you are worthy to receive glory, honor, and power. You created all things, and by your decision they are and were created.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Twenty-four other thrones were in a circle around that throne. And on each of these thrones there was an elder dressed in white clothes and wearing a gold crown.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Flashes of lightning and roars of thunder came out from the throne in the center of the circle. Seven torches, which are the seven spirits of God, were burning in front of the throne.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Also in front of the throne was something that looked like a glass sea, clear as crystal.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">The first creature was like a lion, the second one was like a bull, the third one had the face of a human, and the fourth was like a flying eagle.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Each of the four living creatures had six wings, and their bodies were covered with eyes. Day and night they never stopped singing,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">The living creatures kept praising, honoring, and thanking the one who sits on the throne and who lives forever and ever.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">At the same time the 24 elders knelt down before the one sitting on the throne. And as they worshiped the one who lives forever, they placed their crowns in front of the throne and said,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">&amp;apos;Our Lord and God,</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="5">
			<VERS vnumber="1">In the right hand of the one sitting on the throne I saw a scroll that had writing on the inside and on the outside. And it was sealed in seven places.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">I saw a mighty angel ask with a loud voice, &amp;apos;Who is worthy to open the scroll and break its seals?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">No one in heaven or on earth or under the earth was able to open the scroll or look inside it. &amp;apos;You are worthy to receive the scroll and open its seals, because you were killed. And with your own blood you bought for God people from every tribe, language, nation, and race. and serve God as priests, and they will rule on earth.&amp;apos; &amp;apos;The Lamb who was killed is worthy to receive power, riches, wisdom, strength, honor, glory, and praise.&amp;apos; &amp;apos;Praise, honor, glory, and strength forever and ever to the one who sits on the throne and to the Lamb!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">I cried hard because no one was found worthy to open the scroll or look inside it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Then one of the elders said to me, &amp;apos;Stop crying and look! The one who is called both the &amp;quot;Lion from the Tribe of Judah&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;King David's Great Descendant&amp;quot; has won the victory. He will open the scroll and its seven seals.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Then I looked and saw a Lamb standing in the center of the throne surrounded by the four living creatures and the elders. The Lamb looked as if it had once been killed. It had seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven spirits of God, sent out to all the earth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">The Lamb went over and took the scroll from the right hand of the one who sat on the throne.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">After he had taken it, the four living creatures and the 24 elders knelt down before him. Each of them had a harp and a gold bowl full of incense, which are the prayers of God's people.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Then they sang a new song,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">You let them become kings</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">As I looked, I heard the voices of a large number of angels around the throne and the voices of the living creatures and of the elders. There were millions and millions of them,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">and they were saying in a loud voice,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Then I heard all beings in heaven and on the earth and under the earth and in the sea offer praise. Together, all of them were saying,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">The four living creatures said &amp;apos;Amen,&amp;apos; while the elders knelt down and worshiped.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="6">
			<VERS vnumber="1">At the same time I saw the Lamb open the first of the seven seals, I heard one of the four living creatures shout with a voice like thunder. It said, &amp;apos;Come out!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Then I saw a white horse. Its rider carried a bow and was given a crown. He had already won some victories, and he went out to win more.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">When the Lamb opened the second seal, I heard the second living creature say, &amp;apos;Come out!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Then another horse came out. It was fiery red. And its rider was given the power to take away all peace from the earth, so people would slaughter one another. He was also given a big sword.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">When the Lamb opened the third seal, I heard the third living creature say, &amp;apos;Come out!&amp;apos; Then I saw a black horse, and its rider had a balance scale in one hand.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">I heard what sounded like a voice from somewhere among the four living creatures. It said, &amp;apos;A liter of wheat will cost you a whole day's wages! Three liters of barley will cost you a day's wages too. But don't ruin the olive oil or the wine.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">When the Lamb opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth living creature say, &amp;apos;Come out!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Then I saw a pale green horse. Its rider was named Death, and Death's Kingdom followed close behind. They were given power over one fourth of the earth, and they could kill its people with swords, famines, diseases, and wild animals.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">When the Lamb opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of everyone who had been killed for speaking God's message and telling about their faith.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">They shouted, &amp;apos;Master, you are holy and faithful! How long will it be before you judge and punish the people of this earth who killed us?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Then each of those who had been killed was given a white robe and told to rest for a little while. They had to wait until the complete number of the Lord's other servants and followers would be killed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">When I saw the Lamb open the sixth seal, I looked and saw a great earthquake. The sun turned as dark as sackcloth, and the moon became red as blood.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">The stars in the sky fell to earth, just like figs shaken loose by a windstorm.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Then the sky was rolled up like a scroll, and all mountains and islands were moved from their places.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">The kings of the earth, its famous people, and its military leaders hid in caves or behind rocks on the mountains. They hid there together with the rich and the powerful and with all the slaves and free people.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Then they shouted to the mountains and the rocks, &amp;apos;Fall on us! Hide us from the one who sits on the throne and from the anger of the Lamb.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">That terrible day has come! God and the Lamb will show their anger, and who can face it?&amp;apos;</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="7">
			<VERS vnumber="3">&amp;apos;Don't harm the earth or the sea or any tree! Wait until I have marked the foreheads of the servants of our God.&amp;apos; 12,000 from Reuben, 12,000 from Gad, 12,000 from Naphtali, 12,000 from Manasseh, 12,000 from Levi, 12,000 from Issachar, 12,000 from Joseph, and 12,000 from Benjamin. &amp;apos;Our God, who sits upon the throne, has the power to save his people, and so does the Lamb.&amp;apos; &amp;apos;Amen! Praise, glory, wisdom, thanks, honor, power, and strength belong to our God forever and ever! Amen!&amp;apos; Then he told me: &amp;apos;These are the ones who have gone through the great suffering. They have washed their robes in the blood of the Lamb and have made them white. before the throne of God and worship him in his temple day and night. The one who sits on the throne will spread his tent over them. or thirst again, and they won't be troubled by the sun or any scorching heat. of the throne will be their shepherd. He will lead them to streams of life-giving water, and God will wipe all tears from their eyes.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Then I heard how many people had been marked on the forehead. There were 144,000, and they came from every tribe of Israel:</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="7">12,000 from Simeon,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">12,000 from Zebulun,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">After this, I saw a large crowd with more people than could be counted. They were from every race, tribe, nation, and language, and they stood before the throne and before the Lamb. They wore white robes and held palm branches in their hands,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">as they shouted,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">The angels who stood around the throne knelt in front of it with their faces to the ground. The elders and the four living creatures knelt there with them. Then they all worshiped God</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">and said,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">One of the elders asked me, &amp;apos;Do you know who these people are that are dressed in white robes? Do you know where they come from?&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">&amp;apos;Sir,&amp;apos; I answered, &amp;apos;you must know.&amp;apos;</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="17">&amp;apos;The Lamb in the center</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="8">
			<VERS vnumber="1">When the Lamb opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven for about half an hour.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">I noticed that the seven angels who stood before God were each given a trumpet.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Another angel, who had a gold container for incense, came and stood at the altar. This one was given a lot of incense to offer with the prayers of God's people on the gold altar in front of the throne.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Then the smoke of the incense, together with the prayers of God's people, went up to God from the hand of the angel.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">After this, the angel filled the incense container with fire from the altar and threw it on the earth. Thunder roared, lightning flashed, and the earth shook.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">The seven angels now got ready to blow their trumpets.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">When the first angel blew his trumpet, hail and fire mixed with blood were thrown down on the earth. A third of the earth, a third of the trees, and a third of all green plants were burned.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">When the second angel blew his trumpet, something like a great fiery mountain was thrown into the sea. A third of the sea turned to blood,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">a third of the living creatures in the sea died, and a third of the ships were destroyed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">When the third angel blew his trumpet, a great star fell from heaven. It was burning like a torch, and it fell on a third of the rivers and on a third of the springs of water.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">The name of the star was Bitter, and a third of the water turned bitter. Many people died because the water was so bitter.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">When the fourth angel blew his trumpet, a third of the sun, a third of the moon, and a third of the stars were struck. They each lost a third of their light. So during a third of the day there was no light, and a third of the night was also without light.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Then I looked and saw a lone eagle flying across the sky. It was shouting, &amp;apos;Trouble, trouble, trouble to everyone who lives on earth! The other three angels are now going to blow their trumpets.&amp;apos;</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="9">
			<VERS vnumber="1">When the fifth angel blew his trumpet, I saw a star fall from the sky to earth. It was given the key to the tunnel that leads down to the deep pit.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">As it opened the tunnel, smoke poured out like the smoke of a great furnace. The sun and the air turned dark because of the smoke.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Locusts came out of the smoke and covered the earth. They were given the same power that scorpions have.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">The locusts were told not to harm the grass on the earth or any plant or any tree. They were to punish only those people who did not have God's mark on their foreheads.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">The locusts were allowed to make them suffer for five months, but not to kill them. The suffering they caused was like the sting of a scorpion.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">In those days people will want to die, but they will not be able to. They will hope for death, but it will escape from them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">These locusts looked like horses ready for battle. On their heads they wore something like gold crowns, and they had human faces.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Their hair was like a woman's long hair, and their teeth were like those of a lion.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">On their chests they wore armor made of iron. Their wings roared like an army of horse-drawn chariots rushing into battle.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Their tails were like a scorpion's tail with a stinger that had the power to hurt someone for five months.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Their king was the angel in charge of the deep pit. In Hebrew his name was Abaddon, and in Greek it was Apollyon.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">The first horrible thing has now happened! But wait. Two more horrible things will happen soon.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Then the sixth angel blew his trumpet. I heard a voice speak from the four corners of the gold altar that stands in the presence of God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">The voice spoke to this angel and said, &amp;apos;Release the four angels who are tied up beside the great Euphrates River.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">The four angels had been prepared for this very hour and day and month and year. Now they were set free to kill a third of all people.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">By listening, I could tell there were more than 200,000,000 war horses.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">In my vision their riders wore fiery-red, dark-blue, and yellow armor on their chests. The heads of the horses looked like lions, with fire and smoke and sulfur coming out of their mouths.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">One third of all people were killed by the three terrible troubles caused by the fire, the smoke, and the sulfur.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">The horses had powerful mouths, and their tails were like poisonous snakes that bite and hurt.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">The people who lived through these terrible troubles did not turn away from the idols they had made, and they did not stop worshiping demons. They kept on worshiping idols that were made of gold, silver, bronze, stone, and wood. Not one of these idols could see, hear, or walk.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">No one stopped murdering or practicing witchcraft or being immoral or stealing.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="10">
			<VERS vnumber="1">I saw another powerful angel come down from heaven. This one was covered with a cloud, and a rainbow was over his head. His face was like the sun, his legs were like columns of fire,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">and with his hand he held a little scroll that had been unrolled. He stood there with his right foot on the sea and his left foot on the land.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Then he shouted with a voice that sounded like a growling lion. Thunder roared seven times.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">After the thunder stopped, I was about to write what it had said. But a voice from heaven shouted, &amp;apos;Keep it secret! Don't write these things.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">The angel I had seen standing on the sea and the land then held his right hand up toward heaven.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">He made a promise in the name of God who lives forever and who created heaven, earth, the sea, and every living creature. The angel said, &amp;apos;You won't have to wait any longer.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">God told his secret plans to his servants the prophets, and it will all happen by the time the seventh angel sounds his trumpet.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Once again the voice from heaven spoke to me. It said, &amp;apos;Go and take the open scroll from the hand of the angel standing on the sea and the land.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">When I went over to ask the angel for the little scroll, the angel said, &amp;apos;Take the scroll and eat it! Your stomach will turn sour, but the taste in your mouth will be sweet as honey.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">I took the little scroll from the hand of the angel and ate it. The taste was sweet as honey, but my stomach turned sour.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Then some voices said, &amp;apos;Keep on telling what will happen to the people of many nations, races, and languages, and also to kings.&amp;apos;</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="11">
			<VERS vnumber="1">An angel gave me a measuring stick and said: Measure around God's temple. Be sure to include the altar and everyone worshiping there. &amp;apos;Now the kingdom of this world belongs to our Lord and to his Chosen One! And he will rule forever and ever!&amp;apos; &amp;apos;Lord God All-Powerful, you are and you were, and we thank you. You used your great power and started ruling. you became angry too! Now the time has come for the dead to be judged. It is time for you to reward your servants the prophets and all your people who honor your name, no matter who they are. It is time to destroy everyone who has destroyed the earth.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">But don't measure the courtyard outside the temple building. Leave it out. It has been given to those people who don't know God, and they will trample all over the holy city for 42 months.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">My two witnesses will wear sackcloth, while I let them preach for 1,260 days.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">These two witnesses are the two olive trees and the two lampstands that stand in the presence of the Lord who rules the earth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Any enemy who tries to harm them will be destroyed by the fire that comes out of their mouths.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">They have the power to lock up the sky and to keep rain from falling while they are prophesying. And whenever they want to, they can turn water to blood and cause all kinds of terrible troubles on earth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">After the two witnesses have finished preaching God's message, the beast that lives in the deep pit will come up and fight against them. It will win the battle and kill them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Their bodies will be left lying in the streets of the same great city where their Lord was nailed to a cross. And this city is spiritually like the city of Sodom or the country of Egypt.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">For three and a half days the people of every nation, tribe, language, and race will stare at the bodies of these two witnesses and refuse to let them be buried.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Everyone on earth will celebrate and be happy. They will give gifts to each other, because of what happened to the two prophets who caused them so much trouble.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">But three and a half days later, God will breathe life into their bodies. They will stand up, and everyone who sees them will be terrified.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">The witnesses then heard a loud voice from heaven, saying, &amp;apos;Come up here.&amp;apos; And while their enemies were watching, they were taken up to heaven in a cloud.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">At that same moment there was a terrible earthquake that destroyed a tenth of the city. Seven thousand people were killed, and the rest were frightened and praised the God who rules in heaven.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">The second horrible thing has now happened! And the third one will be here soon.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">At the sound of the seventh trumpet, loud voices were heard in heaven. They said,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Then the 24 elders, who were seated on thrones in God's presence, knelt down and worshiped him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">They said,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">When the nations got angry,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">The door to God's temple in heaven was then opened, and the sacred chest could be seen inside the temple. I saw lightning and heard roars of thunder. The earth trembled and huge hailstones fell to the ground.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="12">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Something important appeared in the sky. It was a woman whose clothes were the sun. The moon was under her feet, and a crown made of twelve stars was on her head.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">She was about to give birth, and she was crying because of the great pain. &amp;apos;Our God has shown his saving power, and his kingdom has come! God's own Chosen One has shown his authority. Satan accused our people in the presence of God day and night. Now he has been thrown out! of the Lamb and the message of God. They were willing to give up their lives. together with everyone who lives there. But pity the earth and the sea, because the devil was thrown down to the earth. He knows his time is short, and he is very angry.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Something else appeared in the sky. It was a huge red dragon with seven heads and ten horns, and a crown on each of its seven heads.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">With its tail, it dragged a third of the stars from the sky and threw them down to the earth. Then the dragon turned toward the woman, because it wanted to eat her child as soon as it was born.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">The woman gave birth to a son, who would rule all nations with an iron rod. The boy was snatched away. He was taken to God and placed on his throne.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">The woman ran into the desert to a place that God had prepared for her. There she would be taken care of for 1,260 days.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">A war broke out in heaven. Michael and his angels were fighting against the dragon and its angels.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">But the dragon lost the battle. It and its angels were forced out of their places in heaven</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">and were thrown down to the earth. Yes, that old snake and his angels were thrown out of heaven! That snake, who fools everyone on earth, is known as the devil and Satan.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Then I heard a voice from heaven shout,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">&amp;apos;Our people defeated Satan because of the blood</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">&amp;apos;The heavens should rejoice,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">When the dragon realized it had been thrown down to the earth, it tried to make trouble for the woman who had given birth to a son.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">But the woman was given two wings like those of a huge eagle, so she could fly into the desert. There she would escape from the snake and be taken care of for a time, two times, and half a time.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">The snake then spewed out water like a river to sweep the woman away.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">But the earth helped her and swallowed the water that had come from the dragon's mouth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">This made the dragon terribly angry with the woman. So it started a war against the rest of her children. They are the people who obey God and are faithful to what Jesus did and taught.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">The dragon stood on the beach beside the sea.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="13">
			<VERS vnumber="1">I looked and saw a beast coming up from the sea. This one had ten horns and seven heads, and a crown was on each of its ten horns. On each of its heads were names that were an insult to God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">The beast I saw had the body of a leopard, the feet of a bear, and the mouth of a lion. The dragon handed over its own power and throne and great authority to this beast.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">One of its heads seemed to have been fatally wounded, but now it was well. Everyone on earth marveled at this beast,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">and they worshiped the dragon who had given its authority to the beast. They also worshiped the beast and said, &amp;apos;No one is like this beast! No one can fight against it.&amp;apos; then listen! to be captured, you will be captured. If you are doomed to be killed by a sword, you will be killed by a sword. This means God's people must learn to endure and be faithful!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">The beast was allowed to brag and claim to be God, and for 42 months it was allowed to rule.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">The beast cursed God, and it cursed the name of God. It even cursed the place where God lives, as well as everyone who lives in heaven with God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">It was allowed to fight against God's people and defeat them. It was also given authority over the people of every tribe, nation, language, and race.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">The beast was worshiped by everyone whose name wasn't written before the time of creation in the book of the Lamb who was killed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">If you have ears,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">If you are doomed</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">I now saw another beast. This one came out of the ground. It had two horns like a lamb, but spoke like a dragon.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">It worked for the beast whose fatal wound had been healed. And it used all its authority to force the earth and its people to worship that beast.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">It worked mighty miracles, and while people watched, it even made fire come down from the sky.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">This second beast fooled people on earth by working miracles for the first one. Then it talked them into making an idol in the form of the beast that did not die after being wounded by a sword.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">It was allowed to put breath into the idol, so it could speak. Everyone who refused to worship the idol of the beast was put to death.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">All people were forced to put a mark on their right hand or forehead. Whether they were powerful or weak, rich or poor, free people or slaves,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">they all had to have this mark, or else they could not buy or sell anything. This mark stood for the name of the beast and for the number of its name.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">You need wisdom to understand the number of the beast! But if you are smart enough, you can figure this out. Its number is 666, and it stands for a person.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="14">
			<VERS vnumber="1">I looked and saw the Lamb standing on Mount Zion! With him were 144,000, who had his name and his Father's name written on their foreheads.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Then I heard a sound from heaven that was like a roaring flood or loud thunder or even like the music of harps.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">And a new song was being sung in front of God's throne and in front of the four living creatures and the elders. No one could learn that song, except the 144,000 who had been rescued from the earth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">All of these are pure virgins, and they follow the Lamb wherever he leads. They have been rescued to be presented to God and the Lamb as the most precious people on earth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">They never tell lies, and they are innocent. Here is what will happen if you worship the beast and the idol and have the mark of the beast on your hand or forehead. The Spirit answered, &amp;apos;Yes, they will rest from their hard work, and they will be rewarded for what they have done.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">I saw another angel. This one was flying across the sky and had the eternal good news to announce to the people of every race, tribe, language, and nation on earth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">The angel shouted, &amp;apos;Worship and honor God! The time has come for him to judge everyone. Kneel down before the one who created heaven and earth, the oceans, and every stream.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">A second angel followed and said, &amp;apos;The great city of Babylon has fallen! This is the city that made all nations drunk and immoral. Now God is angry, and Babylon has fallen.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Finally, a third angel came and shouted:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">You will have to drink the wine that God gives to everyone who makes him angry. You will feel his mighty anger, and you will be tortured with fire and burning sulfur, while the holy angels and the Lamb look on.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">If you worship the beast and the idol and accept the mark of its name, you will be tortured day and night. The smoke from your torture will go up forever and ever, and you will never be able to rest.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">God's people must learn to endure. They must also obey his commands and have faith in Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Then I heard a voice from heaven say, &amp;apos;Put this in writing. From now on, the Lord will bless everyone who has faith in him when they die.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">I looked and saw a bright cloud, and someone who seemed to be the Son of Man was sitting on the cloud. He wore a gold crown on his head and held a sharp sickle in his hand.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">An angel came out of the temple and shouted, &amp;apos;Start cutting with your sickle! Harvest season is here, and all crops on earth are ripe.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">The one on the cloud swung his sickle and harvested the crops.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Another angel with a sharp sickle then came out of the temple in heaven.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">After this, an angel with power over fire came from the altar and shouted to the angel who had the sickle. He said, &amp;apos;All grapes on earth are ripe! Harvest them with your sharp sickle.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">The angel swung his sickle on earth and cut off its grapes. He threw them into a pit where they were trampled on as a sign of God's anger.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">The pit was outside the city, and when the grapes were mashed, blood flowed out. The blood turned into a river that was about 300 kilometers long and almost deep enough to cover a horse.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="15">
			<VERS vnumber="1">After this, I looked at the sky and saw something else that was strange and important. Seven angels were bringing the seven last terrible troubles. When these are ended, God will no longer be angry. &amp;apos;Lord God All-Powerful, you have done great and marvelous things. You are the ruler of all nations, and you do what is right and fair. and praise your name? You alone are holy, and all nations will come and worship you, because you have shown that you judge with fairness.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Then I saw something that looked like a glass sea mixed with fire, and people were standing on it. They were the ones who had defeated the beast and the idol and the number that tells the name of the beast. God had given them harps,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">and they were singing the song his servant Moses and the Lamb had sung. They were singing,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Lord, who doesn't honor</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">After this, I noticed something else in heaven. The sacred tent used for a temple was open.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">And the seven angels who were bringing the terrible troubles were coming out of it. They were dressed in robes of pure white linen and wore belts made of pure gold.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">One of the four living creatures gave each of the seven angels a bowl made of gold. These bowls were filled with the anger of God who lives forever and ever.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">The temple quickly filled with smoke from the glory and power of God. No one could enter it until the seven angels had finished pouring out the seven last troubles.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="16">
			<VERS vnumber="1">From the temple I heard a voice shout to the seven angels, &amp;apos;Go and empty the seven bowls of God's anger on the earth.&amp;apos; &amp;apos;You have always been, and you always will be the holy God. You had the right to judge in this way. of your people and your prophets. So you gave them blood to drink as they deserve!&amp;apos; the altar shout, &amp;apos;Yes, Lord God All-Powerful, your judgments are honest and fair.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">The first angel emptied his bowl on the earth. At once ugly and painful sores broke out on everyone who had the mark of the beast and worshiped the idol.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">The second angel emptied his bowl on the sea. At once the sea turned into blood like that of a dead person, and every living thing in the sea died.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">The third angel emptied his bowl into the rivers and streams. At once they turned to blood.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Then I heard the angel, who has power over water, say,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">They poured out the blood</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">After this, I heard</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">The fourth angel emptied his bowl on the sun, and it began to scorch people like fire.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Everyone was scorched by its great heat, and all of them cursed the name of God who had power over these terrible troubles. But no one turned to God and praised him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">The fifth angel emptied his bowl on the throne of the beast. At once darkness covered its kingdom, and its people began biting their tongues in pain.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">And because of their painful sores, they cursed the God who rules in heaven. But still they did not stop doing evil things.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">The sixth angel emptied his bowl on the great Euphrates River, and it completely dried up to make a road for the kings from the east.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">An evil spirit that looked like a frog came out of the mouth of the dragon. One also came out of the mouth of the beast, and another out of the mouth of the false prophet.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">These evil spirits had the power to work miracles. They went to every king on earth, to bring them together for a war against God All-Powerful. But that will be the day of God's great victory.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Remember Christ says, &amp;apos;When I come, it will surprise you like a thief! But God will bless you, if you are awake and ready. Then you won't have to walk around naked and be ashamed.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Those armies came together in a place that in Hebrew is called Armagedon.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">As soon as the seventh angel emptied his bowl in the air, a loud voice from the throne in the temple shouted, &amp;apos;It's done!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">There were flashes of lightning, roars of thunder, and the worst earthquake in all history.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">The great city of Babylon split into three parts, and the cities of other nations fell. So God made Babylon drink from the wine cup filled with his anger.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Every island ran away, and the mountains disappeared.</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="17">
			<VERS vnumber="1">One of the seven angels who had emptied the bowls came over and said to me, &amp;apos;Come on! I will show you how God will punish that shameless prostitute who sits on many oceans.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Every king on earth has slept with her, and her shameless ways are like wine that has made everyone on earth drunk.&amp;apos; I AM THE GREAT CITY OF BABYLON, THE MOTHER OF EVERY IMMORAL AND FILTHY THING ON EARTH. Why are you so amazed? I will explain the mystery about this woman and about the beast she is sitting on, with its seven heads and ten horns.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">With the help of the Spirit, the angel took me into a desert, where I saw a woman sitting on a red beast. The beast was covered with names that were an insult to God, and it had seven heads and ten horns.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">The woman was dressed in purple and scarlet robes, and she wore jewelry made of gold, precious stones, and pearls. In her hand she held a gold cup filled with the filthy and nasty things she had done.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">On her forehead a mysterious name was written:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">I could tell that the woman was drunk on the blood of God's people who had given their lives for Jesus. This surprising sight amazed me,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">and the angel said:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">The beast you saw is one that used to be and no longer is. It will come back from the deep pit, but only to be destroyed. Everyone on earth whose names were not written in the book of life before the time of creation will be amazed. They will see this beast that used to be and no longer is, but will be once more.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Anyone with wisdom can figure this out. The seven heads that the woman is sitting on stand for seven hills. These heads are also seven kings.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Five of the kings are dead. One is ruling now, and the other one has not yet come. But when he does, he will rule for only a little while.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">You also saw a beast that used to be and no longer is. That beast is one of the seven kings who will return as the eighth king, but only to be destroyed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">The ten horns you saw are ten more kings, who have not yet come into power, and they will rule with the beast for only a short time.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">They all think alike and will give their power and authority to the beast.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">These kings will go to war against the Lamb. But he will defeat them, because he is Lord over all lords and King over all kings. His followers are chosen and special and faithful.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">The oceans you saw the prostitute sitting on are crowds of people from all races and languages.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">The ten horns and the beast will start hating the shameless woman. They will strip off her clothes and leave her naked. Then they will eat her flesh and throw the rest of her body into a fire.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">God is the one who made these kings all think alike and decide to give their power to the beast. And they will do this until what God has said comes true.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">The woman you saw is the great city that rules over all kings on earth.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="18">
			<VERS vnumber="1">I saw another angel come from heaven. This one had great power, and the earth was bright because of his glory.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">The angel shouted, &amp;apos;Fallen! Powerful Babylon has fallen and is now the home of demons. It is the den of every filthy spirit and of all unclean birds, and every dirty and hated animal. has made all nations drunk. Every king on earth has slept with her, and every merchant on earth is rich because of her evil desires.&amp;apos; from heaven shout, &amp;apos;My people, you must escape from Babylon. Don't take part in her sins and share her punishment. as high as heaven. God has remembered the evil she has done. has treated others. Make her pay double for what she has done. Make her drink twice as much of what she mixed for others. with a life of luxury. Reward her now with suffering and pain. &amp;apos;Deep in her heart Babylon said, &amp;quot;I am the queen! Never will I be a widow or know what it means to be sad.&amp;quot; she will suffer the pain of sorrow, hunger, and death. Fire will destroy her dead body, because her judge is the powerful Lord God.&amp;apos; &amp;apos;Pity that great and powerful city! Pity Babylon! In a single hour her judgment has come.&amp;apos; your heart desired have all escaped from you. Every luxury and all your glory will be lost forever.

Everyone who sailed the seas became rich from her treasures. But in a single hour the city was destroyed. with God's people and apostles and prophets. God has punished her for them.&amp;apos; &amp;apos;This is how the great city of Babylon will be thrown down, never to rise again. and of flutes and trumpets will no longer be heard. No workers will ever set up shop in that city, and the sound of grinding grain will be silenced forever. anywhere in Babylon, and couples will never again say wedding vows there. Her merchants ruled the earth, and by her witchcraft she fooled all nations. is found the blood of God's people and of his prophets, and everyone else.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Babylon's evil and immoral wine</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Then I heard another voice</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Her sins are piled</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Treat her as she</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">That woman honored herself</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">And so, in a single day</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Every king on earth who slept with her and shared in her luxury will mourn. They will weep, when they see the smoke from that fire.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Her sufferings will frighten them, and they will stand at a distance and say,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Every merchant on earth will mourn, because there is no one to buy their goods.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">There won't be anyone to buy their gold, silver, jewels, pearls, fine linen, purple cloth, silk, scarlet cloth, sweet-smelling wood, fancy carvings of ivory and wood, as well as things made of bronze, iron, or marble.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">No one will buy their cinnamon, spices, incense, myrrh, frankincense, wine, olive oil, fine flour, wheat, cattle, sheep, horses, chariots, slaves, and other humans.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Babylon, the things</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">The merchants had become rich because of her. But when they saw her sufferings, they were terrified. They stood at a distance, crying and mourning.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="18">When they saw the smoke from her fire, they shouted, &amp;apos;This was the greatest city ever!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">They cried loudly, and in their sorrow they threw dust on their heads, as they said,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">The heavens should be happy</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">A powerful angel then picked up a huge stone and threw it into the sea. The angel said,</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="23">Lamps will no longer shine</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">On the streets of Babylon</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="19">
			<VERS vnumber="1">After this, I heard what sounded like a lot of voices in heaven, and they were shouting, &amp;apos;Praise the Lord! To our God belongs the glorious power to save, are honest and fair. That filthy prostitute ruined the earth with shameful deeds. But God has judged her and made her pay the price for murdering his servants.&amp;apos; &amp;apos;Praise the Lord! Smoke will never stop rising from her burning body.&amp;apos; &amp;apos;If you worship and fear our God, give praise to him, no matter who you are.&amp;apos; &amp;apos;Praise the Lord! Our Lord God All-Powerful now rules as king. and give him praise. The wedding day of the Lamb is here, and his bride is ready. a wedding dress made of pure and shining linen. This linen stands for the good things God's people have done.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">because his judgments</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Then the crowd shouted,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">After this, the 24 elders and the four living creatures all knelt before the throne of God and worshiped him. They said, &amp;apos;Amen! Praise the Lord!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">From the throne a voice said,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Then I heard what seemed to be a large crowd that sounded like a roaring flood and loud thunder all mixed together. They were saying,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">So we will be glad and happy</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">She will be given</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Then the angel told me, &amp;apos;Put this in writing. God will bless everyone who is invited to the wedding feast of the Lamb.&amp;apos; The angel also said, &amp;apos;These things God has said are true.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">I knelt at the feet of the angel and began to worship him. But the angel said, &amp;apos;Don't do that! I am a servant, just like you and everyone else who tells about Jesus. Don't worship anyone but God. Everyone who tells about Jesus does it by the power of the Spirit.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">I looked and saw heaven was open, and a white horse was there. Its rider was called Faithful and True, and he is always fair when he judges or goes to war.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">He had eyes like flames of fire, and he was wearing a lot of crowns. His name was written on him, but he was the only one who knew what the name meant.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">The rider wore a robe that was covered with blood, and he was known as &amp;apos;The Word of God.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">He was followed by armies from heaven that rode on white horses and were dressed in pure white linen.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">From his mouth a sharp sword went out to attack the nations. He will rule them with an iron rod and will show the fierce anger of God All-Powerful by trampling the grapes in the pit where wine is made.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">On the part of the robe that covered his thigh was written, &amp;apos;KING OF KINGS AND Lord OF Lord S.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">I then saw an angel standing on the sun, and he shouted to all the birds flying in the sky, &amp;apos;Come and join in God's great feast!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">You can eat the flesh of kings, rulers, leaders, horses, riders, free people, slaves, important people, and everyone else.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">I also saw the beast and all kings of the earth come together. They fought against the rider on the white horse and against his army.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">But the beast was captured and so was the false prophet. This is the same prophet who had worked miracles for the beast, so he could fool everyone who had the mark of the beast and worshiped the idol. The beast and the false prophet were thrown alive into a lake of burning sulfur.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">But the rest of their army was killed by the sword that came from the mouth of the rider on the horse. Then birds stuffed themselves on the dead bodies.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="20">
			<VERS vnumber="1">I saw an angel come down from heaven, carrying the key to the deep pit and a big chain.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">He chained the dragon for 1,000 years. It is that old snake, who is also known as the devil and Satan.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Then the angel threw the dragon into the pit. He locked and sealed it, so 1,000 years would go by before the dragon could fool the nations again. But after that, it would have to be set free for a little while. No other dead people were raised to life until 1,000 years later.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">I saw thrones, and sitting on those thrones were the ones who had been given the right to judge. I also saw the souls of the people who had their heads cut off because they had told about Jesus and preached God's message. They were the same ones who had not worshiped the beast or the idol, and they had refused to let its mark be put on their foreheads or hands. They will come to life and rule with Christ for 1,000 years.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">At the end of the 1,000 years, Satan will be set free.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">He will fool the countries of Gog and Magog, which are at the far ends of the earth, and their people will follow him into battle. They will have as many followers as there are grains of sand along the beach,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">and they will march all the way across the earth. They will surround the camp of God's people and the city God loves. But fire will come down from heaven and destroy the whole army.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Then the devil who fooled them will be thrown into the lake of fire and burning sulfur. He will be there with the beast and the false prophet, and they will be in pain day and night forever and ever.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">I saw a great white throne with someone sitting on it. Earth and heaven tried to run away, but there was no place for them to go.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">I also saw all the dead people standing in front of that throne. Every one of them was there, no matter who they had once been. Several books were opened, and then the book of life was opened. The dead were judged by what those books said they had done.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">The sea gave up the dead people who were in it, and death and its kingdom also gave up their dead. Then everyone was judged by what they had done.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Afterwards, death and its kingdom were thrown into the lake of fire. This is the second death.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Anyone whose name wasn't written in the book of life was thrown into the lake of fire.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="21">
			<VERS vnumber="1">I saw a new heaven and a new earth. The first heaven and the first earth had disappeared, and so had the sea.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Then I saw New Jerusalem, the holy city, coming down from God in heaven. It was like a bride dressed in her wedding gown and ready to meet her husband. God's home is now with his people. He will live with them, and they will be his own. Yes, God will make his home among his people. I am making everything new. Write down what I have said. My words are true and can be trusted.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">I heard a loud voice shout from the throne:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">He will wipe all tears from their eyes, and there will be no more death, suffering, crying, or pain. These things of the past are gone forever.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Then the one sitting on the throne said:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Everything is finished! I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end. I will freely give water from the life-giving fountain to everyone who is thirsty.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">All who win the victory will be given these blessings. I will be their God, and they will be my people.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">But I will tell you what will happen to cowards and to everyone who is unfaithful or dirty-minded or who murders or is sexually immoral or uses witchcraft or worships idols or tells lies. They will be thrown into that lake of fire and burning sulfur. This is the second death.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">I saw one of the seven angels who had the bowls filled with the seven last terrible troubles. The angel came to me and said, &amp;apos;Come on! I will show you the one who will be the bride and wife of the Lamb.&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Then with the help of the Spirit, he took me to the top of a very high mountain. There he showed me the holy city of Jerusalem coming down from God in heaven.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">The glory of God made the city bright. It was dazzling and crystal clear like a precious jasper stone.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">The city had a high and thick wall with twelve gates, and each one of them was guarded by an angel. On each of the gates was written the name of one of the twelve tribes of Israel.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Three of these gates were on the east, three were on the north, three more were on the south, and the other three were on the west.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">The city was built on twelve foundation stones. On each of the stones was written the name of one of the Lamb's twelve apostles.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">The angel who spoke to me had a gold measuring stick to measure the city and its gates and its walls.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">The city was shaped like a cube, because it was just as high as it was wide. When the angel measured the city, it was about 2,400 kilometers high and 2,400 kilometers wide.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Then the angel measured the wall, and by our measurements it was about 60 meters high.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">The wall was built of jasper, and the city was made of pure gold, clear as crystal.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Each of the twelve foundations was a precious stone. The first was jasper, the second was sapphire, the third was agate, the fourth was emerald,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">the fifth was onyx, the sixth was carnelian, the seventh was chrysolite, the eighth was beryl, the ninth was topaz, the tenth was chrysoprase, the eleventh was jacinth, and the twelfth was amethyst.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Each of the twelve gates was a solid pearl. The streets of the city were made of pure gold, clear as crystal.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">I did not see a temple there. The Lord God All-Powerful and the Lamb were its temple.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">And the city did not need the sun or the moon. The glory of God was shining on it, and the Lamb was its light.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">Nations will walk by the light of that city, and kings will bring their riches there.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">Its gates are always open during the day, and night never comes.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">The glorious treasures of nations will be brought into the city.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">But nothing unworthy will be allowed to enter. No one who is dirty-minded or who tells lies will be there. Only those whose names are written in the Lamb's book of life will be in the city.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="22">
			<VERS vnumber="1">The angel showed me a river that was crystal clear, and its waters gave life. The river came from the throne where God and the Lamb were seated.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Then it flowed down the middle of the city's main street. On each side of the river are trees that grow a different kind of fruit each month of the year. The fruit gives life, and the leaves are used as medicine to heal the nations. These words are true and can be trusted. The Lord God controls the spirits of his prophets, and he is the one who sent his angel to show his servants what must happen very soon. Don't do that! I am a servant, just like you. I am the same as a follower or a prophet or anyone else who obeys what is written in this book. God is the one you should worship. I am coming soon! And when I come, I will reward everyone for what they have done. If you are thirsty, come! If you want life-giving water, come and take it. It's free! If you add anything to them, God will make you suffer all the terrible troubles written in this book. So, Lord Jesus, please come soon!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">God's curse will no longer be on the people of that city. He and the Lamb will be seated there on their thrones, and its people will worship God</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">and will see him face to face. God's name will be written on the foreheads of the people.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Never again will night appear, and no one who lives there will ever need a lamp or the sun. The Lord God will be their light, and they will rule forever.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Then I was told:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Remember, I am coming soon! God will bless everyone who pays attention to the message of this book.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">My name is John, and I am the one who heard and saw these things. Then after I had heard and seen all this, I knelt down and began to worship at the feet of the angel who had shown it to me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">But the angel said,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Don't keep the prophecies in this book a secret. These things will happen soon.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Evil people will keep on being evil, and everyone who is dirty-minded will still be dirty-minded. But good people will keep on doing right, and God's people will always be holy.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Then I was told:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">I am Alpha and Omega, the first and the last, the beginning and the end.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">God will bless all who have washed their robes. They will each have the right to eat fruit from the tree that gives life, and they can enter the gates of the city.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">But outside the city will be dogs, witches, immoral people, murderers, idol worshipers, and everyone who loves to tell lies and do wrong.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">I am Jesus! And I am the one who sent my angel to tell all of you these things for the churches. I am David's Great Descendant, and I am also the bright morning star.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">The Spirit and the bride say, &amp;apos;Come!&amp;apos; Everyone who hears this should say, &amp;apos;Come!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Here is my warning for everyone who hears the prophecies in this book:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">If you take anything away from these prophecies, God will not let you have part in the life-giving tree and in the holy city described in this book.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">The one who has spoken these things says, &amp;apos;I am coming soon!&amp;apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">I pray that the Lord Jesus will be kind to all of you.</VERS>
