		<CHAPTER cnumber="1">
			<VERS vnumber="1">What delight comes to the one who follows God&apos;s ways! He won&apos;t walk in step with the wicked, nor share the sinner&apos;s way, nor be found sitting in the scorner&apos;s seat.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">His passion is to remain true to the Word of &apos;I AM,&apos; meditating day and night on the true revelation of light.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">He will be standing firm like a flourishing tree planted by God&apos;s design, deeply rooted by the brooks of bliss, bearing fruit in every season of life. He is never dry, never fainting, ever blessed, ever prosperous.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">But how different are the wicked. They are like chaff blown away by the wind.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">The wicked will not endure the day of judgment, for God will not defend them. Nothing they do will succeed or endure for long, for they have no part with those who walk in truth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">But how different it is for the righteous! The Lord embraces their paths as they move forward while the way of the wicked leads only to doom.</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="2">
			<VERS vnumber="1">How dare the nations plan a rebellion. Their foolish plots are futile!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Look at how the power brokers of the world rise up to hold their summit as the rulers scheme and confer together against Yahweh and his Anointed King, saying:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">&apos;Let&apos;s come together and break away from the Creator. Once and for all let&apos;s cast off these controlling chains of God and his Christ!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">God-Enthroned</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">merely laughs at them; the Sovereign One mocks their madness!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Then with the fierceness of his fiery anger, he settles the issue and terrifies them to death with these words:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">&apos;I myself have poured out</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">my King on Zion,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">my holy mountain.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">&apos;I will reveal the eternal purpose of God. For he has decreed over me, &apos;You are my favored Son. And as your Father I have crowned you as my King Eternal. Today I became your Father.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Ask me to give you the nations</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">and I will do it, and they shall become your legacy. Your domain will stretch to the ends of the earth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">And you will shepherd them</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">with unlimited authority, crushing their rebellion as an iron rod smashes jars of clay!&apos; &apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">&apos;Listen to me, all you rebel kings and all you upstart judges of the earth. Learn your lesson while there&apos;s still time .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Serve and worship the awe-inspiring God. Recognize his greatness and bow before him, trembling with reverence in his presence.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Fall facedown before him and kiss the Son before his anger is roused against you. Remember that his wrath can be quickly kindled! But many blessings are waiting for all who turn aside to hide themselves in him!&apos;</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="3">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Lord, I have so many enemies, so many who are against me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Listen to how they whisper their slander against me, saying: &apos;Look! He&apos;s hopeless! Even God can&apos;t save him from this!&apos; Pause in his presence</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">But</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">in the depths of my heart I truly know that you, Yahweh, have become my Shield; You take me and surround me with yourself. Your glory covers me continually. You lift high my head.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">I have cried out to you,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Yahweh, from your holy presence. You send me a Father&apos;s help. Pause in his presence</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">So now I&apos;ll lie down and sleep like a baby&apos; then I&apos;ll awake in safety, for you surround me with your glory.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Even though ten thousand dark powers</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">prowl around me, I won&apos;t be afraid.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Rise up and help me, Yahweh! Come and save me, God! For you will slap them in the face, breaking the power of their words to harm me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">For the Lord alone is my Savior. What a feast of favor and bliss he gives his people! Pause in his presence</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="4">
			<VERS vnumber="1">God, you are my righteousness, my Champion Defender. Answer me when I cry for help! Whenever I was in distress, you enlarged me. I&apos;m being squeezed again&apos;I need your kindness right away! Grant me your grace, hear my prayer, and set me free!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Listen to me, you elite among men: How long will you defame my honor and drag it down into shame? Will you ever stop insulting me? How long will you set your heart on shadows, chasing your lies and delusions? Pause in his presence</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">May we never forget that Yahweh works wonders for every one of his devoted lovers. And this is how I know that he will answer my every prayer.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Tremble in awe before the Lord, and do not sin against him. Be still upon your bed and search your heart before him. Pause in his presence</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Bring to Yahweh the sacrifice of righteousness and put your trust in him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Lord, prove them wrong when they say, &apos;God can&apos;t help you!&apos; Let the light of your radiant face break through and shine upon us!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">The intense pleasure you give me surpasses the gladness of harvest time, even more than when the harvesters gaze upon their ripened grain and when their new wine overflows.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Now, because of you, Lord, I will lie down in peace and sleep comes at once, for no matter what happens, I will live unafraid!</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="5">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Listen, Yahweh, to my passionate prayer! Can&apos;t you hear my groaning?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Don&apos;t you hear how I&apos;m crying out to you? My King and my God, consider my every word, for I am calling out to you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">At each and every sunrise you will hear my voice as I prepare my sacrifice of prayer to you. Every morning I lay out the pieces of my life on the altar and wait for your fire to fall upon my heart .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">I know that you, God, are never pleased with lawlessness, and evil ones will never be invited into your house.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Boasters collapse, unable to survive your scrutiny, for your hatred of evildoers is clear.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">You will make an end of all those who lie. How you hate their hypocrisy and despise all who love violence!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">But I know that you will welcome me into your house, for I am covered by your covenant of mercy and love. So I come to your sanctuary with deepest awe to bow in worship and adore you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Yahweh, lead me in the pathways of your pleasure just like you promised me you would, or else my enemies will conquer me. Smooth out your road in front of me, straight and level, so that I will know where to walk.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Their words are unreliable. Destruction is in their hearts, drawing people into their darkness with their speeches. They are smooth-tongued deceivers, flattering with their words.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Declare them guilty, O God! Let their own schemes be their downfall! Let the guilt of their sins collapse on top of them, for they rebel against you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">But let them all be glad, those who turn aside to hide themselves in you. May they keep shouting for joy forever! Overshadow them in your presence as they sing and rejoice. Then every lover of your name will burst forth with endless joy.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Lord, how wonderfully you bless the righteous. Your favor wraps around each one and covers them under your canopy of kindness and joy.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="6">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Yahweh, don&apos;t condemn me. Don&apos;t punish me in your fiery anger.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Please deal gently with me</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">, Yahweh; show me mercy, for I&apos;m sick and frail and weak. Heal me, Yahweh, for I&apos;m falling apart.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">My soul is so troubled; but you, Yahweh&apos;how long?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Yahweh, turn to me and rescue my life because I know your faithful love will never fail me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">In the darkness of death who remembers</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">your name in worship</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">? How could I bring you praise if I&apos;m buried in a tomb?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">I&apos;m worn out with my weeping and groaning. Night after night I soak my pillow with tears, and flood my bed with weeping.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">My eyes</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">of faith</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">won&apos;t focus anymore, for sorrow fills my heart. There are so many enemies who come against me!</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="9">my healer</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">has heard all my pleading and has taken hold of my prayers and answered them all.</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="7">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Yahweh, my God, I turn to hide my soul in you. Save me from all those who pursue and persecute me.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="2">! Don&apos;t let my foes fall upon me like fierce lions with teeth bared. Can&apos;t you see how they want to rip my soul to shreds?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Yahweh, my God, if I have done evil like they say I have, and my hands are guilty,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">if I have wronged someone at peace with me, if I have betrayed a friend, repaying evil for good, or if I have unjustly harmed my enemy,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Then</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">let my enemy pursue and overtake me. Let them grind me into the ground. Let them take my life from me and drag my dignity through the dust! Pause in his presence</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Yahweh, arise in your anger against the anger</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">of my enemies. Awaken your fury and stand up for me! Execute the judgment you have decreed against them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">All the people gather around you. Return to your place on high to preside over them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">You are Yahweh who judges the people. Vindicate me publicly , Yahweh, and restore my honor and integrity. Declare me innocent.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="11">God, your righteousness is revealed when you judge. Because of the strength of your forgiveness, your anger does not break out every day.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Look how the wicked conceive their evil schemes. They go into labor with their lies and give birth to trouble.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">They dig a pit</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">for others to fall into</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1">Yahweh, our Sovereign God, your glory streams from the heavens above, filling the earth with the majesty of your name! People everywhere see your splendor .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">You have built a stronghold by the songs of children. Strength rises up with the chorus of infants. This kind of praise has power to shut Satan&apos;s mouth. Childlike worship will silence the madness of those who oppose you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Look at the splendor of your skies, your creative genius glowing in the heavens. When I gaze at your moon and your stars, mounted like jewels in their settings, I know you are the fascinating artist who fashioned it all! But I have to ask this question:</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="15">For the nations get trapped in the very snares they set for others. The hidden trap they set for the weak has snapped shut upon themselves!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Yahweh is famous for his justice. While the wicked are digging a pit for others, they are actually setting the terms for their own judgment. They will fall into their own pit. Consider the truth of this and pause in his presence</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Don&apos;t forget this</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">: all the wicked will one day fall into the darkness of death&apos;s domain, including the nations that forget God and reject his ways.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="2">What bliss belongs to those who have confessed their corruption to God! For he wipes their slates clean and removes hypocrisy from their hearts.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Before I confessed my sins, I kept it all inside; my dishonesty devastated my inner life, causing my life to be filled with frustration, irrepressible anguish, and misery.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">The pain never let up, for your hand of conviction was heavy on my heart. My strength was sapped, my inner life dried up like a spiritual drought within my soul. Pause in his presence</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Then I finally admitted to you all my sins, refusing to hide them any longer. I said, &apos;My life-giving God, I will openly acknowledge my evil actions.&apos; And you forgave me! All at once the guilt of my sin washed away and all my pain disappeared! Pause in his presence</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">This is what I&apos;ve learned through it all: All believers should confess their sins to God; do it every time God has uncovered you in the time of exposing. For if you do this, when sudden storms of life overwhelm, you&apos;ll be kept safe.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Lord, you are my secret hiding place, protecting me from these troubles, surrounding me with songs of gladness! Your joyous shouts of rescue release my breakthrough. Pause in his presence</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="5">time you&apos;ve given me to live! Compared to you my lifetime is nothing at all! Nothing more than a puff of air&apos;I&apos;m gone so swiftly. So too are the grandest of men; they are nothing but a fleeting shadow!&apos; Pause in his presence</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">We live our lives like those living in shadows. All our activities and energies are spent for things that pass away. We gather, we hoard, we cling to our things, only to leave them all behind for who knows who.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">And now, God,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">I&apos;m left with one conclusion: my only hope is to hope in you alone!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Save me from being overpowered by my sin; don&apos;t make me a disgrace before the degenerate.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Lord, I&apos;m left speechless and I have no excuse, so I&apos;ll not complain any longer. Now I know you&apos;re the one who is behind it all.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">But I can&apos;t take it much longer. Spare me these blows from your discipline-rod. For if you are against me, I will waste away to nothing.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">No one endures when you rebuke and discipline us for our sins. Like a cobweb is swept away with a wave of the hand, you sweep away all that we once called dear. How fleeting and frail our lives! We&apos;re nothing more than a puff of air. Pause in his presence</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Lord, listen to all my tender cries. Read my every tear, like liquid words that plead for your help. I feel all alone at times, like a stranger to you, passing through this life just like all those before me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Don&apos;t let me die without restoring joy and gladness to my soul. May your frown over my failure become a smile over my success.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="40">
			<VERS vnumber="1">I waited and waited and waited some more, patiently, knowing God would come through for me. Then, at last, he bent down and listened to my cry.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">He stooped down to lift me out of danger from the desolate pit I was in, out of the muddy mess I had fallen into. Now he&apos;s lifted me up into a firm, secure place and steadied me while I walk along his ascending path.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">A new song for a new day rises up in me every time I think about how he breaks through for me! Ecstatic praise pours out of my mouth until everyone hears how God has set me free. Many will see his miracles; they&apos;ll stand in awe of God and fall in love with him!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Blessing after blessing comes to those who love and trust the Lord. They will not fall away, for they refuse to listen to the lies of the proud.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">O Lord, our God, no one can compare with you. Such wonderful works and miracles are all found with you! And you think of us all the time with your countless expressions of love&apos; far exceeding our expectations!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">It&apos;s not sacrifices that really move your heart. Burnt offerings, sin offerings&apos;those aren&apos;t what bring you joy. But when you open my ears and speak to me, I become your willing servant, your prisoner of love for life.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">So I said, &apos;Here I am! I&apos;m coming</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">to you as a sacrifice</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">, for in the prophetic scrolls of your book you have written about me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">I delight to fulfill your will, my God, for your living words are written upon the pages of my heart.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">I tell everyone everywhere the truth of your righteousness. And you know I haven&apos;t held back in telling the message to all.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">I don&apos;t keep it a secret or hide the truth. I preach of your faithfulness and kindness, proclaiming your extravagant love to the largest crowd I can find!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">So Lord, don&apos;t hold back your love or withhold your tender mercies from me. Keep me in your truth and let your compassion overflow to me no matter what I face.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Evil surrounds me; problems greater than I can solve come one after another. Without you, I know I can&apos;t make it. My sins are so many! I&apos;m so ashamed to lift my face to you. For my guilt grabs me and stings my soul until I am weakened and spent.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Please, Lord! Come quickly and rescue me! Take pleasure in showing me your favor and restore me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Let all who seek my life be humiliated! Let them be confused and ashamed, God. Scatter those who wish me evil; they just want me dead.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Scoff at every scoffer and cause them all to be utter failures. Let them be ashamed and horrified by their complete defeat.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">But let all who passionately seek you erupt with excitement and joy over what you&apos;ve done! Let all your devoted lovers rejoice continually in the Savior, saying, &apos;How great and glorious is our God!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Lord, in my place of weakness and need, I ask again: Will you come and help me? I know I&apos;m always in your thoughts. You are my true Savior and hero, so don&apos;t delay to deliver me now, for you are my God.</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="41">
			<VERS vnumber="1">God always blesses those who are kind to the poor and helpless. They&apos;re the first ones God helps when they find themselves in any trouble.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="3">When they are sick, lying upon their bed of suffering, God will restore them. He will raise them up again and restore them back to health.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">So</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">in my sickness</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">I say to you, &apos;Lord, be my kind healer. Heal my body and soul; heal me, God! For I have confessed my sins to you.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">But those who hate me wish the worst for me, saying, &apos;When will he die and be forgotten?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">And when these &apos;friends&apos; come to visit me with their pious sympathy and their hollow words and with hypocrisy hidden in their hearts, I can see right through it all. For they come merely to gather gossip about me, using all they find to mock me with malicious hearts of slander.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">They are wicked whisperers who imagine the worst for me, repeating their rumors, saying,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">&apos;He got what he deserved; it&apos;s over for him! The spirit of infirmity is upon him, and he&apos;ll never get over this illness.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Even my ally, my friend, has turned against me. He was one I totally trusted with my life, sharing supper with him, and now he shows me nothing but betrayal and treachery. He has sold me as an enemy.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">So Lord, please don&apos;t desert me when I need you! Give me grace and get me back on my feet so I can triumph over them all.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Then I&apos;ll know you&apos;re pleased with me when you allow me to taste victory over all my foes.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Now stand up for me and don&apos;t let me fall, for I&apos;ve walked with integrity. Keep me before your face forever.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Everyone praise the Lord God of Israel, always and forever! For he is from eternity past and will remain for the eternity to come. That&apos;s the way it will be forever. Faithful is our King! Amen!</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="3">Day and night my tears keep falling and my heart keeps crying for your help, while my enemies mock me over and over, saying, &apos;Where is this God of yours? Why doesn&apos;t he help you? &apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">So I speak over my heartbroken soul, &apos;Take courage. Remember when you used to be right out front leading the procession of praise when the great crowd of worshipers gathered to go into the presence of the Lord? You shouted with joy as the sound of passionate celebration filled the air and the joyous multitude of lovers honored the feast of the Lord!&apos;</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="8">All through the day Yahweh has commanded his endless love to pour over me. Through the night I sing his songs and my praises to the living God.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="10">Their wounding words pierce my heart over and over while they say, &apos;Where is this God of yours?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">So I say to my soul, &apos;Don&apos;t be discouraged. Don&apos;t be disturbed. For I know my God will break through for me.&apos; Then I&apos;ll have plenty of reasons to praise him all over again. Yes, he is my saving grace!</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="3">Our forefathers didn&apos;t take the land by their own strength or their own skill or strategy. But it was through the shining forth of your radiant presence and the display of your mighty power. You loved to give them victory, for you took great delight in them.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="14">By day the moving glory-cloud led them forward. And all through the night the fire-cloud stood as a sentry of light.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Yet they kept their rebellion alive against God Most High, and their sins against God continued to be counted.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">In their hearts they tested God just to get what they wanted, asking for the food their hearts craved.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Then God heard all their complaining and was furious! His anger flared up against his people.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="38">But amazingly, God&apos;so full of compassion&apos;still forgave them. He covered over their sins with his love, refusing to destroy them all. Over and over he held back his anger, restraining wrath to show them mercy.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">He knew that they were made from mere dust&apos; frail, fragile, and short-lived, here today and gone tomorrow.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">How many times they rebelled in their desert days! How they grieved him with their grumblings.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="43">They disregarded all the epic signs and marvels they saw when they escaped from Egypt&apos;s bondage. They forgot the judgment of the plagues that set them free.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="45">He sent them vast swarms of filthy flies that sucked their blood. He sent hordes of frogs, ruining their lives.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="48">Even their cattle fell prey, pounded by the falling hail; their livestock were struck with bolts of lightning.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="49">Finally, he unleashed upon them the fierceness of his anger. Such fury! He sent them sorrow and devastating trouble by his mighty band of destroying angels; messengers of death were dispatched against them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="52">Then, like a shepherd leading his sheep, God led his people out of tyranny, guiding them through the wilderness like a flock.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="53">Safely and carefully God led them out, with nothing to fear. But their enemies he led into the sea. He took care of them there once and for all!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="54">Eventually God brought his people to the Holy Land, to a land of hills that he had prepared for them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="55">He drove out and scattered all the peoples occupying the land, staking out an inheritance, a portion for each of Israel&apos;s tribes.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="56">Yet for all of this, they still rebelled and refused to follow his ways, provoking to anger the God Most High.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="59">Enraged with anger, God turned his wrath on them, and he rejected his people with disgust.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="60">God walked away from them and left his dwelling place at Shiloh, abandoning the place where he had lived among them,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="61">allowing his emblem of strength, his glory-ark, to be captured. Enemies stole the very source of Israel&apos;s power.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="62">God vented his rage, allowing his people to be butchered when they went out to battle, for his anger was intense against his very own.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="63">Their young men fell on the battlefield and never came back. Their daughters never heard their wedding songs, since there was no one left to marry!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="64">Their priests were slaughtered and their widows were killed before they had time to weep.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="65">Then all at once the Almighty awakened as though he had been asleep. Like a mighty man he arose, roaring into action!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="66">He blasted into battle, driving back every foe, defeating them and disgracing them for time and eternity.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="67">He rejected Joseph&apos;s family, the tribe of Ephraim.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="68">He chose instead the tribe of Judah and Mount Zion, which he loves.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="69">There he built his towering temple, strong and enduring as the earth itself.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="10">His promises have become an everlasting covenant to Jacob, as a decree to Jacob.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">He said to them, &apos;I will give you all the land of Canaan as your inheritance.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">They were very few in number when God gave them that promise, and they were all foreigners to that land.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="16">So God decreed a famine upon Canaan-land, cutting off their food supply.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="18">His feet were bruised by strong shackles and his soul was held by iron.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="22">Pharoah gave him authority over all the princes of the land, and Joseph became the teacher of wisdom to the king&apos;s advisers.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">Then Jacob, with all of Joseph&apos;s family, came from Canaan to Egypt and settled in Goshen.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">God made them very fruitful, and they multiplied incredibly until they were greater in number than those who ruled them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">God turned their hearts to hate his people and to deal treacherously with his servants.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">But he sent them his faithful servant, Moses, the deliverer, and chose Aaron to accompany him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">Their command brought down signs and wonders, working miracles in Egypt.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">By God&apos;s direction, they spoke and released a plague of thick darkness over the land.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">God turned their rivers to blood, causing every fish to die.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">And the judgment-plague of frogs came in enormous numbers, swarming everywhere, even into Pharaoh&apos;s bedroom!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">God spoke and another plague was released&apos; massive swarms of flies, vast clouds of insects, covered the land.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">God rained down hail and flaming fire upon Egypt.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">Their gardens and vines were all destroyed, shattering trees into splinters throughout the territory.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">God spoke, and devouring hordes of locusts swept over the land,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">picking the ground clean of vegetation and crops.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">Then God struck down their firstborn sons, the pride and joy of every Egyptian family.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">At last, God freed all the Hebrews from their slavery and sent them away laden with the silver and gold of Egypt. And not even one was feeble on their way out!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">Egypt was relieved at their exodus, ready to see them go, for the terror of the Lord of the Hebrews had fallen upon them!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">God spread out a cloud as shade as they moved ahead and a cloud of fire to light up their night.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">Moses prayed and God brought them quail to eat. He satisfied them with heaven&apos;s bread falling from the sky.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">He broke open the boulder and the waters poured out like a river in the desert.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">For God could never forget his holy promise to his servant Abraham.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43">So God brought out his chosen ones with singing; with a joyful shout they were set free!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44">He gave them lands and nations, just like he promised. Fruitful lands of crops they had never planted were now theirs.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="6">We have all sinned so much, just like our fathers. &apos;Guilty&apos; is written over our lives.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Our fathers who were delivered from Egypt didn&apos;t fully understand your wonders, and they took you for granted. Over and over you showed them such tender love and mercy! Yet they were barely beyond the Red Sea when they rebelled against you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Nonetheless, you saved them more than once so they would know how powerful you are, showing them the honor of your name.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">You roared over the waters of the Red Sea, making a dry path for your people to cross through.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">You freed them from the strong power of those who oppressed them and rescued them from bondage.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Then the waters rushed over their enemies and drowned them all&apos; not one survived.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Seeing this, the people believed your words, and they all broke out with songs of praise!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Yet how quickly they forgot your miracles of power. They wouldn&apos;t wait for you to act when they were hungry,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">but demanded you satisfy their cravings and give them food! They tested you to the breaking point.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">So you gave them what they wanted to eat, but their souls starved away to nothing.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">They became envious of Moses and Aaron, your holy ones.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">You split open the earth, and it swallowed up Dathan and Abiram along with their followers.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Fire fell from heaven and burnt up all the band of rebels, turning them to ashes.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">They made an idol of a calf at Sinai and bowed to worship their man-made statue.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">They preferred the image of a grass-eating ox to the presence of the glory-filled God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">So you decided to destroy them. But Moses, your chosen leader, stood in the gap between you and the people and made intercession on their behalf to turn away your wrath from killing them all.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">Yet they still didn&apos;t believe your words and they despised the land of delight you gave to them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">They grumbled and found fault with everything and closed their hearts to your voice.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">So you solemnly swore to them that they would all die in the desert.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">And you scattered their children to distant lands to die as exiles.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">Then our fathers joined the worshipers of the false god named &apos;Lord of the Pit.&apos; They even ate the sacrifices offered to the dead!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">All they did made you burn with anger. It made you so angry that a plague broke out among them!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">It continued until Phineas intervened and executed the guilty for causing judgment to fall upon them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">Because of this deed of righteousness Phineas will be remembered forever.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">Your people also provoked you to wrath at the stream called Strife. This is where Moses got into serious trouble!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">Because the people were rebellious against you, Moses exploded in anger and spoke to them out of his bitterness.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">Neither did our fathers destroy the enemies in the land, as you had commanded them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">But they mingled themselves with their enemies and learned to copy their works of darkness.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">They began to serve their gods and bow before their idols. All of this led them away from you and brought about their downfall.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">They even sacrificed their little children to the demon spirits,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">This is why you were furious. As your anger burned hot against them, you couldn&apos;t even stand to look at your very own people any longer!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">So you turned them over to the crushing hands of other nations, and those who hated them became tyrants over them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">Oppressive enemies subdued them, ruling over them with their tyranny.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43">Many times you would have come to rescue them, but they continued in their rebellious ways, choosing to ignore your warnings. Then they sank lower and lower, destroyed by their depravity.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46">Then you caused even their oppressors to pity them and show them compassion.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="47">Do it again, Lord! Save us, O Lord, our God! Gather us from our exile and unite us together so that we will give our great and joyous thanks to you again and bring you glory by our praises.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="9">How he satisfies the souls of thirsty ones and fills the hungry with goodness!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Some of us once sat in darkness, living in the dark shadows of death. We were prisoners to our pain, chained to our regrets.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">For we rebelled against God&apos;s Word and rejected the wise counsel of God Most High.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">So he humbled us through our circumstances, watching us as we stumbled, with no one there to pick us back up. Our own pain became our punishment.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Then we cried out, &apos;Lord, help us! Rescue us!&apos; And he did!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">His light broke through the darkness and he led us out in freedom from death&apos;s dark shadow and snapped every one of our chains.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">So lift your hands and give thanks to God for his marvelous kindness and for his miracles of mercy for those he loves!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">For he smashed through heavy prison doors and shattered the steel bars that held us back, just to set us free!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Some of us were such fools, bringing on ourselves sorrow and suffering all because of our sins.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Sick and feeble, unable to stand the sight of food, we drew near to the gates of death.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Then we cried out, &apos;Lord, help us! Rescue us!&apos; And he did!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">God spoke the words &apos;Be healed,&apos; and we were healed, delivered from death&apos;s door!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">So lift your hands and give thanks to God for his marvelous kindness and for his miracles of mercy for those he loves!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Bring your praise as an offering and your thanks as a sacrifice as you sing your story of miracles with a joyful song.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">Some of us set sail upon the sea to faraway ports, transporting our goods from ship to shore.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">We were witnesses of God&apos;s power out in the ocean deep; we saw breathtaking wonders upon the high seas.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">When God spoke he stirred up a storm, lifting high the waves with hurricane winds.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">Then we cried out, &apos;Lord, help us! Rescue us!&apos; And he did!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">God stilled the storm, calmed the waves, and he hushed the hurricane winds to only a whisper.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">We were so relieved, so glad as he guided us safely to harbor in a quiet haven.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">So lift your hands and give thanks to God for his marvelous kindness and for his miracles of mercy for those he loves!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">Let&apos;s exalt him on high and lift up our praises in public; let all the people and the leaders of the nation know how great and wonderful is Yahweh, our God!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">Whenever he chooses he can dry up a river and turn the land into a desert.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">Or he can take a fruitful land and make it into a saltwater swamp, all because of the wickedness of those who dwell there.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">But he also can turn a barren wilderness into an oasis with water! He can make springs flow into desert lands</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">and turn them into fertile valleys so that cities spring up, and he gives it all to those who are hungry.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">They can plant their fields and vineyards there and reap a bumper crop and gather a fruitful harvest.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">God will bless them and cause them to multiply and prosper.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">But others will become poor, humbled because of their oppression, tyranny, and sorrows.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">For God pours contempt upon their arrogant abuse of power, heaping scorn upon their princes, and makes them wander among ruins.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">But he raises up the poor and lowly with his favor, giving them a safe place to live where no one can touch them. God will grant them a large family and bless them!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">The lovers of God will rejoice when they see this. Good men are glad when the evil ones are silenced.</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="1">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Here are kingdom revelations, words to live by, and words of wisdom given to empower you to reign in life, written as proverbs by Israel&apos;s King Solomon, David&apos;s son.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Within these sayings will be found the revelation of wisdom and the impartation of spiritual understanding. Use them as keys to unlock the treasures of true knowledge.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Those who cling to these words will receive discipline to demonstrate wisdom in every relationship and to choose what is right and just and fair.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">These proverbs will give you great skill to teach the immature and make them wise, to give youth the understanding of their design and destiny.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">For the wise, these proverbs will make you even wiser, and for those with discernment, you will be able to acquire brilliant strategies for leadership.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">These kingdom revelations will break open your understanding to unveil the deeper meaning of parables, poetic riddles, and epigrams, and to unravel the words and enigmas of the wise.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">We cross the threshold of true knowledge when we live in obedient devotion to God. Stubborn know-it-alls will never stop to do this, for they scorn true wisdom and knowledge.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Pay close attention, my child, to your father&apos;s wise words and never forget your mother&apos;s instructions.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">For their insight will bring you success, adorning you with grace-filled thoughts and giving you reins to guide your decisions.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">When peer pressure compels you to go with the crowd and sinners invite you to join in, you must simply say, &apos;No!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">When the gang says&apos; &apos;We&apos;re going to steal and kill and get away with it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">We&apos;ll take down the rich and rob them. We&apos;ll swallow them up alive and take what we want from whomever we want.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Then we&apos;ll take their treasures and fill our homes with loot.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">So come on and join us. Take your chance with us. We&apos;ll divide up all we get; we&apos;ll each end up with big bags of cash!&apos;&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">my son, refuse to go with them and stay far away from them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">For crime is their way of life and bloodshed their specialty.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">To be aware of their snare is the best way of escape.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">They&apos;ll resort to murder to steal their victim&apos;s assets, but eventually it will be their own lives that are ambushed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">In their ungodly disrespect for God they bring destruction on their own lives.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Wisdom&apos;s praises are sung in the streets and celebrated far and wide.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Yet wisdom&apos;s song is not always heard in the halls of higher learning. But in the hustle and bustle of everyday life its lyrics can always be heard above the din of the crowd. You will hear wisdom&apos;s warning as she preaches courageously to those who stop to listen:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">&apos;Foolish ones, how much longer will you cling to your deception? How much longer will you mock wisdom, you cynical scorners who fight the facts?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">Come back to your senses and be restored to reality. Don&apos;t even think about refusing my rebuke! Don&apos;t you know that I&apos;m ready to pour out my spirit of wisdom upon you and bring to you the revelation of my words that will make your heart wise?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">I&apos;ve called to you over and over; still you refuse to come to me. I&apos;ve pleaded with you again and again, yet you&apos;ve turned a deaf ear to my voice.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">Because you have laughed at my counsel and have insisted on continuing in your stubbornness,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">I will laugh when your calamity comes and will turn away from you at the time of your disaster. Make a joke of my advice, will you? Then I&apos;ll make a joke out of you!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">When the storm clouds of terror gather over your head, when dread and distress consume you and your catastrophe comes like a hurricane,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">you will cry out to me, but I won&apos;t answer. Then it will be too late to expect my help. When desperation drives you to search for me, I will be nowhere to be found.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">Because you have turned up your nose at me and closed your eyes to the facts and refused to worship me in awe &apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">because you scoffed at my wise counsel and laughed at my correction&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">now you will eat the bitter fruit of your own ways. You&apos;ve made your own bed; now lie in it! So how do you like that?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">Like an idiot you&apos;ve turned away from me and chosen destruction instead. Your self-satisfied smugness will kill you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">But the one who always listens to me will live undisturbed in a heavenly peace. Free from fear, confident and courageous, that one will rest unafraid and sheltered from the storms of life.&apos;</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="2">
			<VERS vnumber="1">My child, will you treasure my wisdom? Then, and only then, will you acquire it. And only if you accept my advice and hide it within will you succeed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">So train your heart to listen when I speak and open your spirit wide to expand your discernment&apos; then pass it on to your sons and daughters.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Yes, cry out for comprehension and intercede for insight.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">For if you keep seeking it like a man would seek for sterling silver, searching in hidden places for cherished treasure,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">then you will discover the fear of the Lord and find the true knowledge of God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Wisdom is a gift from a generous God, and every word he speaks is full of revelation and becomes a fountain of understanding within you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Then you will discover all that is just, proper, and fair, and be empowered to make the right decisions as you walk into your destiny.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">When wisdom wins your heart and revelation breaks in, true pleasure enters your soul.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">If you choose to follow good counsel, divine design will watch over you and understanding will protect you from making poor choices.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">It will rescue you from evil in disguise and from those who speak duplicities.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">For they have left the paths of righteousness and walk in the ways of darkness.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">They take pleasure when evil prospers and thoroughly enjoy a lifestyle of sin.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">But they&apos;re walking on a path to nowhere, wandering away into deeper deception.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Only wisdom can save you from the flattery of the promiscuous woman&apos; she&apos;s such a smooth-talking seductress!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">She left her husband and has forgotten her wedding vows.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">You&apos;ll find her house on the road to hell,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">and all the men who go through her doors will never come back to the place they were&apos; they will find nothing but desolation and despair.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Follow those who follow wisdom and stay on the right path.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">For all my godly lovers will enjoy life to the fullest and will inherit their destinies.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">But the treacherous ones who love darkness will lose not only all they could have had, but even their own souls!</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="3">
			<VERS vnumber="3">Hold on to loyal love and don&apos;t let go, and be faithful to all that you&apos;ve been taught. Let your life be shaped by integrity, with truth written upon your heart.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">That&apos;s how you will find favor and understanding with both God and men&apos; you will gain the reputation of living life well.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Trust in the Lord completely, and do not rely on your own opinions. With all your heart rely on him to guide you, and he will lead you in every decision you make.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Become intimate with him in whatever you do, and he will lead you wherever you go.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Don&apos;t think for a moment that you know it all, for wisdom comes when you adore him with undivided devotion and avoid everything that&apos;s wrong.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Then you will find the healing refreshment your body and spirit long for.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Glorify God with all your wealth, honoring him with your firstfruits, with every increase that comes to you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Then every dimension of your life will overflow with blessings from an uncontainable source of inner joy!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">My child, when the Lord God speaks to you, never take his words lightly, and never be upset when he corrects you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">For the Father&apos;s discipline comes only from his passionate love and pleasure for you. Even when it seems like his correction is harsh, it&apos;s still better than any father on earth gives to his child.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Blessings pour over the ones who find wisdom, for they have obtained living-understanding.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">As wisdom increases, a great treasure is imparted, greater than many bars of refined gold.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">It is a more valuable commodity than gold and gemstones, for there is nothing you desire that could compare to her.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Wisdom extends to you long life in one hand and wealth and promotion in the other. Out of her mouth flows righteousness, and her words release both law and mercy.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">The ways of wisdom are sweet, always drawing you into the place of wholeness.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Seeking for her brings the discovery of untold blessings, for she is the healing tree of life to those who taste her fruits.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">The Lord laid the earth&apos;s foundations with wisdom&apos;s blueprints. By his living-understanding all the universe came into being.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">By his divine revelation he broke open the hidden fountains of the deep, bringing secret springs to the surface as the mist of the night dripped down from heaven.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">My child, never drift off course from these two goals for your life: to walk in wisdom and to discover your purpose. Don&apos;t ever forget how they empower you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">For they strengthen you inside and out and inspire you to do what&apos;s right; you will be energized and refreshed by the healing they bring.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">They give you living hope to guide you, and not one of life&apos;s tests will cause you to stumble.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">You will sleep like a baby, safe and sound&apos; your rest will be sweet and secure.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">You will not be subject to terror, for it will not terrify you. Nor will the disrespectful be able to push you aside,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">because God is your confidence in times of crisis, keeping your heart at rest in every situation.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">Why would you withhold payment on your debt when you have the ability to pay? Just do it!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">When your friend comes to ask you for a favor, why would you say, &apos;Perhaps tomorrow,&apos; when you have the money right there in your pocket? Help him today!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">Why would you hold a grudge</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">in your heart toward your neighbor who lives right next door?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">And why would you quarrel with those who have done nothing wrong to you? Is that a chip on your shoulder?</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1">This is the scroll of the genealogy</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">of Jesus,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">the Anointed One, the son of David and descendant of Abraham.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Abraham had a son named Isaac, who had a son named Jacob, who had a son named Judah</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">(he and his brothers became the tribes of Israel)</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Judah and Tamar</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">had twin sons, Perez and Zerah. Perez had a son named Hezron, who had a son named Ram,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">who had a son named Amminadab, who had a son named Nashon,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">who had a son named Salmon, who, along with Rahab, had a son named Boaz. Boaz and Ruth had a son named Obed, who was the father of Jesse,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">and Jesse had a son named David,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">who became the king</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Then David and Bathsheba</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">had a son named Solomon, who had a son named Rehoboam, who had a son named Abijah, who had a son named Asa,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">who had a son named Jehoshaphat, who had a son named Joram, who had a son named Uzziah,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">who had a son named Jotham, who had a son named Ahaz, who had a son named Hezekiah,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">who had a son named Manasseh, who had a son named Amos,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">who had a son named Josiah,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">who was the father of Jeconiah. It was during the days of Jeconiah and his brothers that Israel was taken captive and deported to Babylon.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">About the time of their captivity in Babylon, Jeconiah had a son named Shealtiel, who had a son named Zerubbabel,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">who had a son named Abiud, who had a son named Eliakim,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">who had a son named Azor, who had a son named Zadok, who had a son named Achim, who had a son named Eliud,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">who had a son named Eleazar, who had a son named Matthan, who had a son named Jacob,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">who was the father of Joseph, the husband</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">of Mary the mother of Jesus, who is called &apos;the Anointed One.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">So from Abraham to David were fourteen generations, and from David to the Babylonian captivity, fourteen generations, and from the Babylonian captivity to Christ, fourteen generations.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">This is how the birth of Jesus Christ took place. His mother, Mary, had promised Joseph to be his wife, but while she was still a virgin she became pregnant through the power of the Holy Spirit.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Her fianc&apos;,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Joseph, was a righteous man full of integrity and he didn&apos;t want to disgrace her, but when he learned of her pregnancy he secretly planned to break the engagement.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">While he was still debating with himself about what to do,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">he fell asleep and had a supernatural dream. An angel from the Lord appeared to him and said, &apos;Joseph, descendant of David, don&apos;t hesitate to take Mary into your home as your wife,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">because the power of the Holy Spirit has conceived a child in her womb.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">She will give birth to a son and you are to name him &apos;Savior,&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">for he is destined to</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">give his life</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">to save his people from their sins.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">This happened to fulfill what the Lord had spoken through his prophet:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">Listen! A virgin</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">will be pregnant, she will give birth to a Son, and he will be known as &apos;Emmanuel,&apos; which means in Hebrew, &apos;God became one of us.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">When Joseph woke from his dream, he did all that the angel of the Lord instructed him to do. He took Mary to be his wife,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">but they refrained from having sex until she gave birth to her firstborn son, whom they named &apos;Jesus.&apos;</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="2">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Jesus was born in Bethlehem</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">near Jerusalem</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">during the reign of King Herod.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">After Jesus&apos; birth a group of spiritual priests</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">from the East came to Jerusalem</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">and inquired of the people, &apos;Where is the child who is born king of the Jewish people? We observed his star rising in the sky</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">and we&apos;ve come to bow before him in worship.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">King Herod was shaken to the core when he heard this, and not only he, but all of Jerusalem was disturbed when they heard this news.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">So he called a meeting of the Jewish ruling priests and religious scholars, demanding that they tell him where the promised Messiah was prophesied to be born.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">&apos;He will be born in Bethlehem, in the land of Judah,&apos; they told him. &apos;Because the prophecy states:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">And you, little Bethlehem, are not insignificant among the clans of Judah, for out of you will emerge the Shepherd-King of my people Israel!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Then Herod secretly summoned the spiritual priests from the East to ascertain the exact time the star first appeared.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">And he told them, &apos;Now go to Bethlehem and carefully look there for the child, and when you&apos;ve found him, report to me so that I can go and bow down and worship him too.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">And on their way to Bethlehem, the same star they had seen in the East suddenly reappeared! Amazed, they watched as it went ahead of them and stopped directly over the place where the child was.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">And when they saw the star, they were so ecstatic that they shouted and celebrated with unrestrained joy.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">When they came into the house and saw the young child with Mary, his mother, they fell to the ground at his feet and worshiped him. Then they opened their treasure chests</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">full of gifts and presented him with gold, frankincense, and myrrh.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Afterward they returned to their own country by another route because God had warned them in a dream not to go back to Herod.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">After they had gone, Joseph had another dream. An angel of the Lord appeared to him and said, &apos;Get up now and flee to Egypt. Take Mary and the little child and stay there until I tell you to leave, for Herod intends to search for the child to kill him.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">So that very night he got up and took Jesus and his mother and made their escape to Egypt</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">and remained there until Herod died. All of this fulfilled what the Lord had spoken through his prophet: I summon my Son out of Egypt.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">When Herod realized that he had been tricked by the wise men, he was infuriated. So he sent soldiers with orders to slaughter every baby boy two years old and younger in Bethlehem and throughout the surrounding countryside, based on the time frame he was given from interrogating the wise men.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">This fulfilled the words of the prophet Jeremiah:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">I hear the screams of anguish, weeping, and wailing in Ramah. Rachel is weeping uncontrollably for her children. And she refuses to be comforted, because they are dead and gone.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">After Herod died, an angel of the Lord appeared again to Joseph in a dream while he was still in Egypt,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">saying, &apos;Go back to the land of Israel and take the child and his mother with you, for those who sought to kill the child are dead.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">So he awoke and took Jesus and Mary and returned to the land of Israel.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">But when he heard that Archelaus, Herod&apos;s son, had succeeded him as ruler over all of the territory of Judah, he was afraid to go back. Then he had another dream from God, warning him to avoid that region and instructing him instead to go to the province of Galilee.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">So he settled his family in the village of Nazareth, fulfilling the prophecy that he would be known as the &apos;Branch.&apos;</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="3">
			<VERS vnumber="1">It was at this time that John the Baptizer</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">began to preach in the desert of Judah.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">His message was this:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">&apos;Heaven&apos;s kingdom</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">is about to appear&apos;so you&apos;d better keep turning away from evil and turn back to God!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Isaiah was referring to John when he prophesied: A thunderous voice! One will be crying out in the wilderness, &apos;Prepare yourself for the Lord&apos;s coming and level a straight path inside your hearts for him.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Now, John wore clothing made from camel&apos;s hair, tied at his waist with a leather strap, and his food consisted of dried locusts</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">and wild honey.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">A steady stream of people from Jerusalem, all the surrounding countryside,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">and the region near the Jordan came out to the wilderness to be baptized by him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">And while they were publicly confessing their sins, he would immerse them in the Jordan River.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">But when he saw many coming from among the wealthy elite of Jewish society</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">and many of the religious leaders known as Pharisees</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">coming to witness the baptism, he began to denounce them, saying, &apos;You offspring of vipers!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Who warned you</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">to slither away like snakes from the fire of God&apos;s judgment</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">You must prove your repentance by a changed life.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">And don&apos;t presume you can get away with merely saying to yourselves, &apos;But we&apos;re Abraham&apos;s descendants!&apos; For I tell you, God can awaken these stones to become sons of Abraham!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">The axe</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">is now ready to cut down the trees at their very roots. Every fruitless, rotten tree will be chopped down and thrown into the fire.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Those who repent I baptize with water, but there is coming a man after me who is more powerful than I. In fact, I&apos;m not even worthy enough to pick up his sandals. He will submerge you into union with the Spirit of Holiness and with a raging fire!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">He comes with a winnowing fork</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">in his hands and comes to his threshing floor to sift what is worthless from what is pure. And he is ready to sweep out his threshing floor and gather his wheat into his granary,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">but the straw he will burn up with a fire that can&apos;t be extinguished!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Then Jesus left Galilee to come to the Jordan to be baptized by John.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">But when he waded into the water, John resisted him, saying, &apos;Why are you doing this? I&apos;m the one who needs to be baptized by you, and yet you come to be baptized by me?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Jesus replied,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">&apos;It is only right to do all that God requires.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Then John baptized Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">And as</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Jesus rose up out of the water, the heavenly realm opened up over him</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">and he saw the Holy Spirit descend out of the heavens and rest upon him in the form of a dove.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Then suddenly the voice of the Father shouted from the sky, saying, &apos;This is my Son&apos;the Beloved!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">My greatest delight is in him.&apos;</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="4">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Afterward, the Holy Spirit led Jesus into the wilderness to experience the ordeal of testing</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">by the accuser.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">And after fasting for forty days,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Jesus was extremely hungry.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Then the tempter came to him and said, &apos;How can you possibly be the Son of God and go hungry? Just command these stones to be turned into loaves of bread.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">He answered,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">&apos;The Scriptures say: Bread alone will not satisfy, but true life is found in every word that constantly goes forth from God&apos;s mouth.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Then the accuser transported Jesus to the holy city of Jerusalem and perched him at the highest point</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">of the temple</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">and said to him, &apos;If you&apos;re really God&apos;s Son, jump, and the angels will catch you. For it is written in the Scriptures: He will command his angels to protect you and they will lift you up so that you won&apos;t even bruise your foot on a rock.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Once again Jesus said to him,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">&apos;The Scriptures say: You must never put the Lord your God to a test.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">And the third time the accuser lifted Jesus up onto a very high mountain range and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and all the splendor that goes with it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">&apos;All of these kingdoms I will give to you,&apos; the accuser said, &apos;if only you will kneel down before me and worship me.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">But Jesus said,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">&apos;Go away, Satan!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">For the Scriptures say: Kneel before the Lord your God and worship only him.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">At once the accuser left him, and angels suddenly gathered around Jesus to minister to his needs.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">When Jesus heard that John the Baptizer had been thrown into prison, he went back into Galilee.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Jesus moved from Nazareth to make his home in Capernaum,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">which is by Lake Galilee in the land of Zebulun and Naphtali.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">He did this to make the prophecy of Isaiah come true:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Listen, you who live in the land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali, along the road to the sea and on the other side of the Jordan, and Galilee&apos;the land of the Gentiles!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">You who spend your days shrouded in darkness can now say, &apos;We have seen a brilliant Light.&apos; And those who live in the dark shadow land of death can now say, &apos;The Dawning Light arises on us.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">From that time on Jesus began to proclaim his message with these words:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">&apos;Keep turning away from your sins and come back to God, for heaven&apos;s kingdom realm is now accessible.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">As he was walking by the shore of Lake Galilee, Jesus noticed two fishermen who were brothers. One was nicknamed Keefa</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">(later called Peter), and the other was Andrew, his brother. Watching as they were casting their nets into the water,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Jesus called out to them and said,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">&apos;Come and follow me, and I will transform you into men who catch people for God.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Immediately they dropped their nets and left everything behind to follow Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Leaving there, Jesus found three other men sitting in a boat, mending their nets. Two were brothers, Jacob</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">and John, and they were with their father, Zebedee.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Jesus called Jacob and John to his side</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">and said to them</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">&apos;Come and follow me.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">And at once they left their boat and their father, and began to follow Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">Jesus ministered from place to place throughout all of the province of Galilee. He taught</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">in the synagogues, preaching the wonderful news of the kingdom and healing every kind of sickness and disease among the people.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">His fame spread throughout all Syria! Many people who were in pain and suffering with every kind of illness were brought to Jesus for their healing&apos;epileptics,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">paralytics, and those tormented by demonic powers were all set free. Everyone who was brought to Jesus was healed!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">This resulted in massive crowds of people following him, including people from Galilee, Jerusalem, the land of Judah, the region of the Ten Cities known as the Decapolis, and beyond the Jordan River.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="5">
			<VERS vnumber="1">One day Jesus saw a vast crowd of people gathering to hear him, so he went up the slope of a hill and sat down. With his followers and disciples spread over the hillside,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Jesus began to teach them:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">&apos;What happiness comes to you</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">when you feel your spiritual poverty!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">For yours is the realm of heaven&apos;s kingdom.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">&apos;What delight comes to you when you wait upon the Lord!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">For you will find what you long for.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">&apos;What blessing comes to you when gentleness</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">lives in you! For you will inherit the earth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">&apos;How enriched you are when you crave righteousness!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">For you will be satisfied.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">&apos;How blessed you are when you demonstrate tender mercy!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">For tender mercy will be demonstrated to you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">&apos;What bliss you experience when your heart is pure!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">For then your eyes will open to see more and more of God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">&apos;How joyful you are when you make peace! For then you will be recognized as a true child of God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">&apos;How enriched you are when persecuted</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">for doing what is right!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">For then you experience the realm of heaven&apos;s kingdom.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">&apos;How blessed you are when people insult</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">and persecute you and speak all kinds of cruel lies about you because of your love for me!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">So leap for joy&apos;since your heavenly reward is great. For you are being rejected the same way the prophets were before you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">&apos;Your lives are like salt among the people. But if you, like salt, become bland, how can your &apos;saltiness&apos; be restored? Flavorless salt is good for nothing</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">and will be thrown out and trampled on by others.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">&apos;Your lives light up the world. For how can you hide a city that stands on a hilltop?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">And who would light a lamp and then hide it in an obscure place?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Instead, it&apos;s placed where everyone in the house can benefit from its light.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">So don&apos;t hide your light!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Let it shine brightly before others, so that your commendable works</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">will shine as light upon them, and then they will give their praise to your Father in heaven.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">&apos;If you think I&apos;ve come to set aside the law of Moses or the writings of the prophets, you&apos;re mistaken. I have come to bring to perfection all that has been written.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Indeed, I assure you, as long as heaven and earth endure, not even the smallest detail</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">of the Law will be done away with until its purpose is complete.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">So whoever violates</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">even the least important of the commandments,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">and teaches others to do so, will be called least in heaven&apos;s kingdom. But whoever obeys them and teaches their truths to others will be called great in heaven&apos;s kingdom.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">For I tell you, unless your lives are more pure and full of integrity</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">than the religious scholars</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">and the Pharisees, you will never enter heaven&apos;s kingdom.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">&apos;You&apos;re familiar with the commandment taught to those of old: &apos;Do not murder or you will be judged.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">But I&apos;m telling you, if you hold anger in your heart</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">toward a fellow believer, you are subject to judgment.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">And whoever demeans and insults</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">a fellow believer is answerable to the congregation.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">And whoever calls down curses upon a fellow believer</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">is in danger of being sent to a fiery hell.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">&apos;So then, if you are presenting a gift before the altar and suddenly you remember a quarrel you have with a fellow believer,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">leave your gift there in front of the altar and go at once to apologize to the one who is offended. Then, after you have reconciled,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">come to the altar and present your gift.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">It is always better to come to terms with the one who wants to sue you before you go to trial, or you may be found guilty by the judge, and he will hand you over to the officers, who will throw you into prison.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">Believe me, you won&apos;t get out of prison until you have paid the full amount!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">&apos;Your ancestors have been taught, &apos;Never commit adultery.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">However, I say to you, if you look with lust in your eyes at a woman who is not your wife, you&apos;ve already committed adultery in your heart.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">If your right eye seduces you to fall into sin,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">then go blind in your right eye!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">For you&apos;re better off losing sight in one eye than to have your whole body thrown into hell.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">And if your right hand entices you to sin, let it go limp and useless!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">For you&apos;re better off losing a part of your body than to have it all thrown into hell.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">&apos;It has been said, &apos;Whoever divorces</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">his wife must give her legal divorce papers.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">However, I say to you, if anyone divorces his wife for any reason, except for infidelity, he causes her to commit adultery, and whoever marries a divorced</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">woman commits adultery.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">&apos;Again, your ancestors were taught, &apos;Never swear an oath that you don&apos;t intend to keep,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">but keep your vows to the Lord God.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">However, I say to you, don&apos;t bind yourself by taking an oath at all. Don&apos;t swear by heaven, for heaven is where God&apos;s throne is placed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">Don&apos;t swear an oath by the earth, because it is the rug under God&apos;s feet,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">and not by Jerusalem, because it is the city of the Great King.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">And why would you swear by your own head, because it&apos;s not in your power to turn a single hair white or black?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">But just let your words ring true.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">A simple &apos;Yes&apos; or &apos;No&apos; will suffice. Anything beyond this springs from a deceiver.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">&apos;Your ancestors have also been taught, &apos;Take an eye in exchange for an eye and a tooth in exchange for a tooth.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">However, I say to you, don&apos;t repay an evil act with another evil act.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">But whoever insults you by slapping you on the right cheek, turn the other to him as well.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">If someone is determined to sue you for your coat, give him the shirt off your back as a gift in return.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">And should people in authority take advantage of you, do more than what they demand.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">Learn to generously share what you have with those who ask for help, and don&apos;t close your heart to the one who comes to borrow from you.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43">&apos;Your ancestors have also been taught &apos;Love your neighbors</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43">and hate the one who hates you.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44">However, I say to you, love your enemy, bless the one who curses you, do something wonderful for the one who hates you,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44">and respond to the very ones who persecute you by praying for them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45">For that will reveal your identity as children of your heavenly Father. He is kind to all by bringing the sunrise to warm and rainfall to refresh whether a person does what is good or evil.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46">What reward do you deserve if you only love the loveable? Don&apos;t even the tax collectors</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46">do that?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="47">How are you any different from others if you limit your kindness</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="47">only to your friends? Don&apos;t even the ungodly</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="6">
			<VERS vnumber="1">&apos;Examine your motives to make sure you&apos;re not showing off when you do your good deeds, only to be admired by others; otherwise, you will lose the reward of your heavenly Father.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">So when you give to the poor, don&apos;t announce it and make a show of it just to be seen by people,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">like the hypocrites</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">in the streets and in the marketplace.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">They&apos;ve already received their reward!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">But when you demonstrate generosity, do it with pure motives and without drawing attention to yourself.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Give secretly and your Father, who sees all you do, will reward you openly.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">&apos;Whenever you pray, be sincere and not like the pretenders who love the attention they receive while praying before others in the meetings and on street corners. Believe me, they&apos;ve already received their reward.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">But whenever you pray, go into your innermost chamber and be alone with Father God,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">praying to him in secret. And your Father, who sees all you do, will reward you openly.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">When you pray, there is no need to repeat empty phrases, praying like the Gentiles do, for they expect God to hear them because of their many words.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">There is no need to imitate them, since your Father already knows what you need before you ask him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Pray like this: &apos;Our Beloved Father, dwelling in the heavenly realms, may the glory of your name be the center on which our lives turn.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Manifest your kingdom realm,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">and cause your every purpose to be fulfilled on earth, just as it is in heaven.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">We acknowledge you as our Provider of all we need each day.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Forgive us the wrongs we have done</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">as we ourselves release forgiveness to those who have wronged us.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="13">and set us free from evil. For you are the King who rules with power and glory forever. Amen.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">And when you pray</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">, make sure you forgive the faults of others so that your Father in heaven will also forgive you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">But if you withhold forgiveness from others, your Father withholds forgiveness from you.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">&apos;When you fast, don&apos;t look gloomy and pretend to be spiritual. They want everyone to know they&apos;re fasting, so they appear in public looking miserable and disheveled.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Believe me, they&apos;ve already received their reward.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">&apos;Don&apos;t keep hoarding for yourselves earthly treasures that can be stolen by thieves. Material wealth eventually rusts, decays, and loses its value.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Instead, stockpile heavenly treasures</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">for yourselves that cannot be stolen and will never rust, decay, or lose their value.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">For your heart will always pursue what you esteem as your treasure.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">&apos;The eyes of your spirit allow revelation-light</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="23">But if your eyes are focused on money,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">the light cannot penetrate and darkness takes its place.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">How profound will be the darkness within you</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">if the light of truth cannot enter!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">&apos;How could you worship two gods at the same time? You will have to hate one and love the other, or be devoted to one and despise the other. You can&apos;t worship the true God while enslaved to the god of money!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">&apos;This is why I tell you to never be worried about your life, for all that you need will be provided, such as food, water, clothing&apos;everything your body needs. Isn&apos;t there more to your life than a meal? Isn&apos;t your body more than clothing?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">&apos;Consider the birds&apos;do you think they worry about their existence? They don&apos;t plant or reap or store up food, yet your heavenly Father provides them each with food. Aren&apos;t you much more valuable to your Father than they?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">So, which one of you by worrying could add anything to your life?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">&apos;And why would you worry about your clothing? Look at all the beautiful flowers of the field. They don&apos;t work or toil,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">and yet not even Solomon in all his splendor was robed in beauty like one of these!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">So if God has clothed the meadow with hay, which is here for such a short time and then dried up and burned, won&apos;t he provide for you the clothes you need&apos;you of little faith?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">&apos;So then, forsake your worries! Why would you say, &apos;What will we eat?&apos; or &apos;What will we drink?&apos; or &apos;What will we wear?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">For that is what the unbelievers</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">chase after. Doesn&apos;t your heavenly Father already know the things your bodies require?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">&apos;So above all, constantly seek God&apos;s kingdom</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">and his righteousness, then all these less important things will be given to you abundantly.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1">&apos;Refuse to be a critic full of bias toward others, and you will not be judged.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">For you&apos;ll be judged by the same standard that you&apos;ve used to judge others. The measurement you use on them will be used on you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Why would you focus on the flaw in someone else&apos;s life and fail to notice the glaring flaws of your own?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">How could you say to your friend, &apos;Let me show you where you&apos;re wrong,&apos; when you&apos;re guilty of even more?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">You&apos;re being hypercritical and a hypocrite! First acknowledge and deal with your own &apos;blind spots,&apos; and then you&apos;ll be capable of dealing with the &apos;blind spot&apos; of your friend.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="7">&apos;Ask, and the gift is yours. Seek, and you&apos;ll discover. Knock, and the door will be opened for you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">For every persistent one will get what he asks for. Every persistent seeker will discover what he longs for. And everyone who knocks persistently will one day find an open door.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">&apos;Do you know of any parent who would give his hungry child, who asked for food, a plate of rocks instead?</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="11">If you, imperfect as you are,</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="12">&apos;In everything you do, be careful to treat others in the same way you&apos;d want them to treat you,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">for that is the essence of all the teachings of the Law and the Prophets.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Enter through the narrow gate</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="14">The narrow gate and the difficult way leads to eternal life&apos;so few even find it!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">&apos;Constantly be on your guard against phony prophets. They come disguised as lambs, appearing to be genuine, but on the inside they are like wild, ravenous wolves!</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="28">By the time Jesus finished speaking, the crowds were awestruck</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">by his teaching,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">because his words carried such great authority, quite unlike the religious scholars.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="8">
			<VERS vnumber="1">After he came down from teaching on the hillside, massive crowds began following him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Suddenly, a leper walked up to Jesus and threw himself down before him</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">in worship</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">and said, &apos;Lord, you have the power to heal me . . . if you really want to.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Jesus reached out his hand and touched the leper and said,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">&apos;Of course I want to heal you&apos;be healed!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">And instantly, all signs of leprosy</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">disappeared!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Then Jesus said to him,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">&apos;Don&apos;t speak to anyone, but go at once and find a priest and show him what has happened to you. Make sure to take the offering Moses commanded so he can certify your healing.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">When Jesus entered the village of Capernaum, a captain</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">in the Roman army approached him, asking for a miracle.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">&apos;Lord,&apos; he said, &apos;I have a son</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">who is lying in my home, paralyzed and suffering terribly.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Jesus responded,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">&apos;I will go with you and heal him.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Jesus was astonished when he heard this and said to those who were following him,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">&apos;He has greater faith than anyone I&apos;ve encountered in Israel!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Listen to what I am about to tell you. Multitudes of Gentiles will stream from the east and the west, to enter into the heavenly kingdom with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">But many Israelites, born to be heirs of the kingdom, will be turned away and banished into the darkness where there will be bitter weeping and unbearable anguish.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Then Jesus turned to the Roman officer and said,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">&apos;Go home. All that you have believed for will be done for you!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">And his son was healed at that very moment.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Then Jesus entered Peter&apos;s home and found Peter&apos;s mother-in-law bedridden, severely ill with a fever.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">The moment Jesus touched her hand she was healed!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Immediately she got up and began to make dinner for them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">That evening the people brought to him many who were demonized. And by Jesus only speaking a word of healing over them, they were totally set free from their torment,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">and everyone who was sick received their healing!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">In doing this, Jesus fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah: He put upon himself our weaknesses, and he carried away our diseases and made us well.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">At the sight of large crowds gathering around him, Jesus gave orders to his disciples to get ready to sail back over to the other side of the lake.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Just then, a religious scholar</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">approached him and said, &apos;Teacher, I&apos;ll follow you wherever you go!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Jesus replied,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">&apos;Foxes have dens, birds have nests, but the Son of Man</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">has no true home in this world.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Then another man spoke up and said, &apos;Lord, I&apos;ll follow you, but first I must take care of my aged father and bury him when he dies.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">But Jesus said to him,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">&apos;Now is the time to follow me, and let those who are dead bury their own dead.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">They all got into a boat and began to cross over to the other side of the lake.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">And Jesus, exhausted, fell asleep</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">Suddenly a violent storm</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">developed, with waves so high the boat was about to be swamped. Yet Jesus continued to sleep soundly.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">The disciples woke him up, saying, &apos;Save us, Lord! We&apos;re going to die!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">But Jesus reprimanded them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">&apos;Why are you gripped with fear?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">Where is your faith?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">Then he stood and rebuked</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">the storm, saying,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">&apos;Be still!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">And instantly it became perfectly calm.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">The disciples were astonished by this miracle and said to one another, &apos;Who is this Man? Even the wind and waves obey his Word.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">When they arrived on the other side of the lake, in the region of the Gadarenes,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">two demonized men confronted Jesus. They lived among the tombs of a cemetery and were considered so extremely violent that no one felt safe passing through that area.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">The demons screamed at Jesus, shouting, &apos;Son of God, what do you want with us?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">Leave us alone! Have you come to torment us before the appointed time?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">There was a large herd of pigs feeding nearby.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">And the demons pleaded, &apos;If you cast us out, send us into that herd of pigs.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">Jesus commanded,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">&apos;Then go!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">And at once the demons came out of the men and went into the pigs.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">Then the entire herd of crazed pigs stampeded down the steep slope and fell into the water and drowned.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">The men who were herding the pigs fled to the nearby town and informed the people of all that had happened to the demonized men.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">Then everyone from the town went out to confront Jesus and urged him to go away and leave them alone.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="9">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Jesus got into the boat and returned to what was considered his hometown,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">Capernaum</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Just then some people brought a paraplegic man to him, lying on a sleeping mat. When Jesus perceived the strong faith within their hearts, he said to the paralyzed man,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">&apos;My son, be encouraged, for your sins have been forgiven.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">These words prompted some of the religious scholars to think, &apos;Why, that&apos;s nothing but blasphemy!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Jesus supernaturally perceived their thoughts, and said to them,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">&apos;Why do you carry such evil in your hearts?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Which is easier to say, &apos;Your sins are forgiven,&apos; or, &apos;Stand up and walk!&apos;?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">But now, to convince you that the Son of Man has been given authority to forgive sins, I say to this man, &apos;Stand up, pick up your mat, and walk home.&apos; &apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Immediately the man sprang to his feet and left for home.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">When the crowds witnessed this miracle, they were awestruck.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">They shouted praises to God because he had given such authority to human beings.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">As Jesus left Capernaum he came upon a tax-collecting station, where a Jewish man named Matthew was collecting taxes for the Romans. &apos;Come, follow me,&apos; Jesus said to him. Immediately Matthew jumped up and began to follow Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Jesus went to Matthew&apos;s house and made himself at home. Many other tax collectors and outcasts of society were invited to eat with Jesus and his disciples.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">When those known as the Pharisees saw what was happening, they were indignant, and they kept asking Jesus&apos; disciples, &apos;Why would your Master dine with such lowlifes?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">When Jesus overheard this, he spoke up and said,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">&apos;Healthy people don&apos;t need to see a doctor, but the sick</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">will go for treatment.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Then he added,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">&apos;Now you should go and study the meaning of the verse: I want you to show mercy, not just offer me a sacrifice. For I have come to invite the outcasts of society and sinners, not those who think they are already on the right path.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">The disciples of John the Baptizer approached Jesus with this question: &apos;Why is it that we and the Pharisees fast regularly, but not your disciples?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Jesus replied,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">&apos;How can the sons of the bridal chamber</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">grieve when the Bridegroom is next to them? But the days of fasting will come when the Bridegroom is taken away from them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">And who would mend worn-out clothing with new fabric? When the new cloth shrinks it will rip, making the hole worse than before.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">And who would pour fresh, new wine into an old wineskin? Eventually the wine will ferment</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">and make the wineskin burst, losing everything&apos;the wine is spilled and the wineskin ruined. Instead, new wine is always poured into a new wineskin so that both are preserved.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">While Jesus was still speaking, an influential Jewish leader</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">approached and knelt before him, saying, &apos;Help me! My daughter has just died. Please come and place your hand upon her so that she will live again.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">So Jesus and his disciples got up and went with him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Suddenly, a woman came from behind Jesus and touched the tassel of his prayer shawl</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">for healing</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">She had been suffering from continual bleeding for twelve years,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">but had faith that Jesus could heal her</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">For she kept saying to herself, &apos;If I could only touch his prayer shawl</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">I would be healed.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Just then Jesus turned around and looked at her and said,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">&apos;My daughter, be encouraged. Your faith has healed you.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">And instantly she was healed!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">When Jesus finally entered the home of the Jewish leader, he saw a noisy crowd of mourners, wailing and playing a funeral dirge on their flutes.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">He told them,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">&apos;You must leave, for the little girl is not dead; she&apos;s only asleep.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">Then everyone began to ridicule him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">After he made the crowd go outside, he went into the girl&apos;s room and gently took hold of her hand. She immediately stood to her feet!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">And the news of this incredible miracle spread everywhere.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">As Jesus left the house, two blind men began following him, shouting out over and over, &apos;Son of David,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">show us mercy and heal us!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">And they followed him right into the house where Jesus was staying.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">So Jesus asked them,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">&apos;Do you believe that I have the power to restore sight to your eyes?&apos; They replied, &apos;Yes Lord, we believe!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">Then Jesus put his hands over their eyes and said,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">&apos;You will have what your faith expects!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">And instantly their eyes opened&apos;they could see! Then Jesus warned them sternly,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">&apos;Make sure that you tell no one what just happened!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">But unable to contain themselves, they went out and spread the news everywhere!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">While they were leaving, some people brought before Jesus a demonized man who couldn&apos;t speak.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">Jesus cast the demon out of him, and immediately the man began to speak</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">plainly</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">. The crowds marveled in astonishment, saying, &apos;We&apos;ve never seen miracles like this in Israel!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">But the Pharisees kept saying, &apos;The chief of demons is helping him drive out demons.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">Jesus walked throughout the region</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">with the joyful message of God&apos;s kingdom realm. He taught in their meeting houses, and wherever he went he demonstrated God&apos;s power by healing every kind of disease and illness.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">When he saw the vast crowds of people, Jesus&apos; heart was deeply moved with compassion, because they seemed weary and helpless, like wandering sheep without a shepherd.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">He turned to his disciples and said,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">&apos;The harvest is huge and ripe! But there are not enough harvesters to bring it all in.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">As you go, plead with the Owner of the Harvest to thrust out</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">many more reapers to harvest his grain!&apos;</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="10">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Jesus gathered his twelve</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">disciples and imparted to them authority to cast out demons and to heal every sickness</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="2">Now, these are the names of the twelve apostles: first, Simon, who is nicknamed Peter, and Andrew, his brother. And then Jacob</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="3">then Thomas and Matthew, the tax collector; Jacob the son of Alphaeus; Thaddeus;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Simon, the former member of the Zealot party,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">and Judas the locksmith, who eventually betrayed Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Jesus sent out the Twelve with these instructions:</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="10">Travel light,</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="15">Mark my words, on the day of judgment the wicked people who lived in the land of Sodom and Gomorrah will have a lesser degree of judgment than the city that rejects you,</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="15">!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Now, remember, it is I who sends you out, even though you feel vulnerable as lambs going into a pack of wolves. So be as shrewd as snakes yet as harmless</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="11">
			<VERS vnumber="1">After Jesus finished giving instructions to his twelve disciples, he went on to minister in different villages throughout the region.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Now, while John the Baptizer was in prison, he heard about the</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">wonderful</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">deeds of the Christ, so he sent his disciples to ask him this question:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">&apos;Are you really the one the prophets said would come, or should we still wait for another?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Jesus answered them,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">&apos;Give John this report:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">&apos;The blind see again, the crippled walk, lepers are cured, the deaf hear, the dead are raised back to life, and the poor and broken now hear of the hope of salvation!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">And tell John that the blessing of heaven comes to those who are not offended over me.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">As they were leaving, Jesus began to speak to the crowd about John.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">&apos;What kind of man did you see when you went out into the wilderness? Did you expect to see a man who would be easily intimidated?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Who was he? Did you expect to see a man decked out in the splendid fashion of the day?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Those who wear fancy clothes live like kings in palaces.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Or did you encounter a true prophet out in the lonely wilderness? Yes, John was a prophet like those of the past, but he is even more than that!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">He was the fulfillment of this Scripture: See, I am sending my prophetic messenger who will go ahead of me and prepare hearts to receive me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">&apos;For I tell you the truth, throughout history there has never been a man who surpasses John the Baptizer. Yet the least of those who now experience heaven&apos;s kingdom will become even greater than he.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">From the moment John stepped onto the scene until now, the realm of heaven&apos;s kingdom is bursting forth, and passionate people have taken hold of its power.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">For all the prophets and the Torah</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">prophesied until John appeared.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">If you can receive this truth, John is the Elijah who was destined to come.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">So listen and understand what I&apos;m telling you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">&apos;How could I describe the people of this generation? You&apos;re like children playing games on the playground,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">yelling at their playmates,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">&apos;You don&apos;t like it when we want to play Wedding! And you don&apos;t like it when we want to play Funeral! You will neither dance nor mourn.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Why is it that when John came to you, neither feasting nor drinking wine, you said, &apos;He has a demon in him!&apos;?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Yet when the Son of Man came and went to feasts and drank wine, you said, &apos;Look at this man! He is nothing but a glutton and a drunkard! He spends all his time with tax collectors and other sinners.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">But God&apos;s wisdom will become visible by those who embrace it.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Then Jesus began to openly denounce the cities where he had done most of his mighty miracles, because the people failed to turn away from sin and return to God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">He said,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">&apos;How tragic it will be for the city of Korazin! And how horrible for the city of Bethsaida! For if the powerful miracles that I performed in Korazin and Bethsaida had been done in Tyre and Sidon,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">they would have humbled themselves and repented, and turned from their sins.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Tyre and Sidon</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">will be better off on judgment day than you!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">And Capernaum&apos;do you really think you&apos;ll be exalted because of the great miracles I have done there? No! You&apos;ll be brought down to the depths of hell</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">because of your rejection of me. For if the miracles I worked in your streets were done in Sodom, it would still be standing today!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">But I tell you, it will be more bearable for the region of Sodom in the day of judgment than it will be for you.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">Then Jesus exclaimed,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">&apos;Father, thank you, for you are Lord, the Supreme Ruler over heaven and earth! And you have hidden the great revelation of your authority from those who are proud and think they are wise and unveiled it instead to little children.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">Yes, Father, you&apos;ve chosen this gracious plan to extend your kingdom.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">You have entrusted me with all that you are and all that you have. No one fully and intimately knows the Son except the Father. And no one fully and intimately knows the Father except the Son. But the Son is able to unveil the Father to anyone he chooses.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">&apos;Are you weary, carrying a heavy burden? Come to me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">I will refresh your life, for I am your oasis.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">Simply join your life with mine.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">Learn my ways and you&apos;ll discover that I&apos;m gentle,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">humble, easy to please. You will find refreshment and rest in me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">For all that I require of you will be pleasant</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">and easy to bear.&apos;</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="12">
			<VERS vnumber="1">One Saturday, on the day of rest,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">Jesus and his disciples were walking through a field of wheat. The disciples were hungry, so they plucked off some heads of grain and rubbed them in their hands</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">to eat.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">But when some of the Pharisees saw what was happening, they said to him, &apos;Look! Your disciples shouldn&apos;t be harvesting grain</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">on the Sabbath!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Jesus responded,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">&apos;Haven&apos;t you ever read what King David and his men did when they were hungry?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">They entered the house of God</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">and ate the sacred bread of God&apos;s presence,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">violating the law by eating bread that only the priests were allowed to eat.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">&apos;And haven&apos;t you read in the Torah that the priests violated the rules of the Sabbath by carrying out their duties in the temple on a Saturday, and yet they are without blame?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">But I say to you, there is one here who is even greater than the temple.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">If only you could learn the meaning of the words &apos;I want compassion more than a sacrifice,&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">you wouldn&apos;t be condemning my innocent disciples.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">For the Son of Man exercises his lordship over the Sabbath.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Then Jesus left them and went into the synagogue where</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">he encountered a man who had an atrophied, paralyzed hand.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">The fault-finding Pharisees asked Jesus, &apos;Is it permissible to perform a work of healing on the Sabbath?&apos; They only asked him this question because they hoped to accuse him of breaking the Jewish laws.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">He answered them,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">&apos;If any of you had a lamb that fell into a ditch on the Sabbath, wouldn&apos;t you reach out your hand and lift it out?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Isn&apos;t a man much more valuable than a lamb? So of course, it&apos;s always proper to do miracles,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">even on the Sabbath.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Then he turned to the man and said, &apos;Hold out your hand!&apos; And as he stretched it out, it was restored, exactly like the other.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Immediately the Pharisees went out and started to scheme about how they would destroy him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Jesus knew what they were thinking, so he left by another way. Massive crowds followed him from there, and he healed all who were sick.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">However, he sternly warned them not to tell others or disclose his real identity,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">in order to fulfill the prophecy of Isaiah:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Take a careful look at my servant,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">my chosen one. I love him dearly and I find all my delight in him. I will breathe my Spirit upon him and he will decree justice to the nations.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">He will not quarrel or raise his voice in public.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">He won&apos;t brush aside the bruised and broken. He will be gentle with the weak and feeble, until his victory releases justice.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">And the fame of his name will birth hope among the people.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Then a man was brought before Jesus who had a demon spirit that made him both blind and mute. Jesus healed him instantly, and he could see and talk again!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">The crowds went wild with amazement as they witnessed this miracle. And they kept saying to one another, &apos;Could this man be the Messiah?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">But when the Pharisees overheard what the people were saying, they said, &apos;He casts out demons by the power of Satan,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">the prince of demons!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">Jesus supernaturally perceived their thoughts and motives, so he told them this parable: &apos;Any kingdom that fights against itself is reduced to ruins. And any family or community splintered by strife will fall apart.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">So if Satan casts out Satan, he is making war on himself. How then could his kingdom stand?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">So if Satan empowers me to cast out demons, who empowers your exorcists</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">to cast them out? Go ask them, let them be your judges.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">But, if I drive out demons by the power of the Spirit of God, then the end of Satan&apos;s kingdom has come!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">Who would dare enter the house of a mighty man and steal his property? First he must be overpowered and tied up by one who is stronger than he. Then his entire house can be plundered.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">So join with me,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">for if you&apos;re not on my side you are against me. And if you refuse to help me gather the spoils,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">you are making things worse.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">This is why I warn you. God will forgive people for every sin and blasphemy except one. There is no forgiveness for the sin of blasphemy against the Holy Spirit.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">If anyone speaks evil of me, the Son of Man, he can be forgiven; but if anyone speaks against the Holy Spirit, it will never be forgiven, now or ever!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">&apos;You must determine if a tree is good or rotten. You can recognize good trees by their delicious fruit. But if you find rotten fruit, you can be certain that the tree is rotten. The fruit defines the tree.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">But you who are known as the Pharisees are rotten to the core like venomous snakes.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">How can your words be good if you are rotten within? For what has been stored up in your hearts will be heard in the overflow of your words!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">&apos;When virtue is stored within, the hearts of good, upright people will produce good fruit. But when evil is hidden within, those who are evil will produce evil fruit.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">You can be sure of this: when the day of judgment comes, everyone will be held accountable for every careless word</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">he has spoken.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">Your very words will be used as evidence, and your words will declare you either innocent or guilty.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">Then a few Jewish scholars and Pharisees spoke up and said, &apos;Teacher, why don&apos;t you perform a miraculous sign for us.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">Jesus replied,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">&apos;Only evil people who are unfaithful to God would demand a sign.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">There will be no sign given to you except the sign of the prophet Jonah.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">For as Jonah was in the belly of the huge sea creature for three days and three nights, so the Son of Man will be in the heart of the earth for three days and three nights.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">The people of Nineveh will also rise up on the day of judgment to condemn this generation.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">For they all repented when they heard the preaching of Jonah. And there is one greater than Jonah here</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">preaching to you today</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">Even the Queen of Sheba</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">will rise up on the day of judgment to condemn this generation for its unbelief! She journeyed from a far and distant land just to hear the wisdom of King Solomon. Yet now there is one greater than Solomon speaking to you today.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43">&apos;When a demon is cast out of a person, it roams around a dry region, looking for a place to rest, but never finds it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44">Then it says, &apos;I&apos;ll return to the house I moved out of,&apos; and so it goes back, only to find that the house is vacant, warm, and ready for it to move back in.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45">So it goes looking for seven other demons more evil than itself, and they all enter together to live there. Then the person&apos;s condition becomes much worse than it was in the beginning. This describes what will also happen to the people of this evil generation.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46">While Jesus was still speaking to the crowds, his mother and brothers came and stood outside,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46">asking for him to come out and speak with them</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46">.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="47">Then someone said, &apos;Look, your mother and brothers are standing outside, wanting to have a word with you.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="48">But Jesus just looked at him and said,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="48">&apos;Let me introduce you to my true mother and brothers.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="49">Then</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="49">gesturing to the disciples gathered around him</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="49">, he said,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="49">&apos;Look closely, for this is my true family.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="50">When you obey my heavenly Father, that makes you a part of my true family.&apos;</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="13">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Later that day, Jesus left the house and sat by the lakeshore</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">to teach the people</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Soon, there were so many people surrounding him that he had to teach sitting in a boat while the large crowd stood on the shore.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">He taught them many things by using stories, parables to illustrate spiritual truths,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">saying: &apos;Consider this: There was a farmer who went out to sow seeds .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">As he cast his</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">seeds</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">, some fell along the beaten path and the birds came and ate them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Others fell onto gravel that had no topsoil. They quickly shot up,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">but when the days grew hot, they were scorched and withered because they had insufficient roots.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Others fell among the thorns, so when they sprouted, the thorns choked them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">But other</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">seeds</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">fell on good, rich soil that kept producing a good harvest. Some yielded thirty, some sixty, and some even one hundred times as much as he planted!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">If you&apos;re able to understand this, then you need to respond.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Then his disciples approached Jesus and asked, &apos;Why do you always speak to people in these hard-to-understand parables?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">He explained,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">&apos;You&apos;ve been given the intimate experience of insight into the hidden mysteries</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">of the realm of heaven&apos;s kingdom, but they have not.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">For everyone who listens with an open heart will receive progressively more revelation</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">until he has more than enough.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">But those who don&apos;t listen with an open, teachable heart, even the understanding that they think they have will be taken from them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">That&apos;s why I teach the people using parables, because they think they&apos;re looking for truth, yet because their hearts are unteachable, they never discover it. Although they will listen to me, they never fully perceive the message I speak.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">The prophecy of Isaiah describes them perfectly: Although they listen carefully to everything I speak, they don&apos;t understand a thing I say. They look and pretend to see, but the eyes of their hearts are closed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Their minds are dull and slow to perceive,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">their ears are plugged and are hard of hearing, and they have deliberately shut their eyes to the truth. Otherwise they would open their eyes to see, and open their ears to hear, and open their minds to understand. Then they would turn to me and I would instantly heal them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">&apos;But blissful are your eyes, for they see. Delighted are your ears, for they are open to hear all these things.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Many prophets and godly people yearned to see these days of miracles that you&apos;ve been favored to see. They would have given everything to hear the revelation you&apos;ve been favored to hear.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">&apos;Now you are ready to hear the explanation of the parable of the sower:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">&apos;What was sown along the path represents the one who listens to the message of the kingdom</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">but doesn&apos;t understand it. The Adversary then comes and snatches away what was sown into his heart.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">&apos;The one sown on gravel represents the person who gladly hears the kingdom message,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">but his experience remains shallow.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Shortly after he hears it, troubles and persecutions come because of the kingdom message he received. Then he quickly falls away,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">for the truth didn&apos;t sink deeply into his heart.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">&apos;The one sown among thorns represents one who receives the message, but all of life&apos;s busy distractions, his divided heart, and his ambition for wealth</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">result in suffocating the kingdom message and it becomes fruitless.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">&apos;But what was sown on good, rich soil represents the one who hears and fully embraces the message of the kingdom. Their lives bear good fruit&apos;some yield a harvest of thirty, sixty, even one hundred times as much as was sown.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">Then Jesus taught them</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">another parable: &apos;Heaven&apos;s kingdom can be compared to a farmer who planted good seed in his field.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">But when everyone was asleep, an enemy came and planted weeds</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">among the wheat and ran away.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">When the wheat sprouted and bore grain, the weeds also appeared.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">So the farmer&apos;s hired hands came to him and said, &apos;Sir, wasn&apos;t that good seed that you sowed in the field? Where did all these weeds come from?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">&apos;He answered, &apos;This has to be the work of an enemy!&apos; &apos;They replied, &apos;Do you want us to go and gather up all the weeds?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">&apos; &apos;No,&apos; he said. &apos;If you pull out the weeds you might uproot the wheat at the same time.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">Let them both grow together until the harvest. At that time, I&apos;ll tell my harvesters to gather the weeds first and tie them all in bundles to be burned. Then they will harvest the wheat and put it into my barn.&apos; &apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">Then Jesus taught them another parable: &apos;Heaven&apos;s kingdom can be compared to the tiny mustard seed that a man takes and plants in his field.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">Although the smallest of all the seeds, it eventually grows into the greatest of garden plants, becoming a tree for birds to come and build their nests in its branches.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">Then he taught them another parable: &apos;Heaven&apos;s kingdom can be compared to yeast that a woman takes and blends into three measures of flour and then waits until all the dough rises.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">Whenever Jesus addressed the crowds, he always spoke in allegories. He never spoke without using parables.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">He did this to fulfill the prophecy: I will speak to you in allegories. I will reveal secrets that have been concealed since before the foundation of the world.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">Jesus left the crowds and went inside the house</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">where he was staying</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">Then his disciples approached him and asked, &apos;Please explain the deeper meaning of the parable of the weeds growing in the field of wheat.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">He answered,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">&apos;The man who sowed his field with good seed is the Son of Man.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">And the field is the world. The good seeds I sow are the children of the kingdom realm. The weeds are the children of the Evil One,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">and the enemy who sows them is the devil. The harvest points to the end of this age, and the harvesters are God&apos;s messengers.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">As the weeds are bundled up and thrown into the fire, so it will be at the close of the age.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">The Son of Man will send his messengers, and they will uproot everything out of his kingdom. All the lawless ones and everything that causes sin will be removed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">And they will throw them into the fiery furnace, where they will experience great sorrow and anguish.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43">Then the righteous will shine like the brightness of the sun</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43">in their Father&apos;s kingdom realm. If you&apos;re able to understand this, then you&apos;d better respond!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44">&apos;Heaven&apos;s kingdom realm can be illustrated like this: &apos;A person discovered that there was hidden treasure in a field. Upon finding it, he hid it again. Because of uncovering such treasure, he was overjoyed and sold all that he possessed to buy the entire field just so he could have the treasure.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45">&apos;Heaven&apos;s kingdom realm is also like a jewel merchant in search of rare pearls.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46">When he discovered one very precious</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46">and exquisite</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46">pearl, he immediately gave up all he had in exchange for it.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="47">&apos;Again, heaven&apos;s kingdom realm is like a fisherman who casts his large net into the lake, catching an assortment of fish.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="48">When the net was filled, the fishermen hauled it up on the shore, and they all sat down to sort out their catch. They collected the good in baskets and threw the bad away.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="49">And so it will be at the close of the age. The messengers</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="49">will come and separate the evil from among the godly</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="50">and throw them into the fiery furnace, where they will experience great sorrow and anguish.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="51">Now do you understand all this?&apos; &apos;Yes,&apos; they replied.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="52">He responded,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="52">&apos;Every scholar of the Scriptures,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="52">who is instructed in the ways of heaven&apos;s kingdom realm, is like a wealthy home owner with his house filled with treasures both new and old.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="53">Right after Jesus taught this series of parables, he left</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="53">from there.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="54">When Jesus arrived in his hometown</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="54">of Nazareth</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="54">, he began teaching the people in the synagogue. Everyone was dazed, overwhelmed with astonishment</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="54">over the depth of revelation they were hearing. They said to one another, &apos;Where did this man get such great wisdom and miraculous powers?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="55">Isn&apos;t he just the craftsman&apos;s son?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="55">Isn&apos;t his mother named Mary, and his four brothers Jacob, Joseph, Simon, and Judah?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="56">And don&apos;t his sisters all live here in Nazareth? From where then did he get all this revelation and power?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="57">And the people became offended and began to turn against him. Jesus said, &apos;There&apos;s only one place a prophet isn&apos;t honored&apos;his own hometown!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="58">And their unbelief kept him from doing many mighty miracles</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="58">in Nazareth</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="58">.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="14">
			<VERS vnumber="1">At that time Herod,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">the Roman ruler over Galilee, heard reports about Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">He told his officials, &apos;This man has to be John the Baptizer who has come back from the dead. That&apos;s why he has this power to work miracles.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">For Herod had earlier arrested John for confronting him for taking the wife of his brother Philip. He had John thrown in prison and placed in chains</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">because John had repeatedly said to him, &apos;It&apos;s not legal or proper for you to be married to Herodias, your sister-in-law!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">So Herod wanted John dead, but he was afraid of the crowds who flocked to John because they considered him to be a prophet.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">During Herod&apos;s birthday celebration, the daughter of Herodias</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">danced before Herod and all his distinguished guests, which greatly pleased the king.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">So he said to her in front of them all, &apos;I give you my oath, ask of me anything you wish and it will be yours!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Because she had been instructed by her mother, she said, &apos;I want the head of John the Baptizer here on a platter!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">This grieved the king, but because of his oath in front of all of his guests,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">he had John beheaded in prison.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">They brought in his head and displayed it to her on a platter, and she then had it shown to her mother.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">John&apos;s disciples went into the prison and carried his body away and buried it. Then they left to find Jesus and tell him what had happened.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">On hearing this, Jesus slipped away privately by boat to be alone. But when the crowds discovered he had sailed away, they emerged from all the nearby towns and followed him on foot.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">So when Jesus landed he had a huge crowd waiting for him. Seeing so many people, his heart was deeply moved with compassion toward them, so he healed all the sick who were in the crowd.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Later that afternoon the disciples came to Jesus and said, &apos;It&apos;s going to be dark soon and the people are hungry, but there&apos;s nothing to eat here in this desolate place. You should send the crowds away to the nearby villages to buy themselves some food.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">&apos;They don&apos;t need to leave,&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Jesus responded.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">&apos;You can give them something to eat.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">They answered, &apos;But all we have is five barley loaves and two fish.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">&apos;Let me have them,&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Jesus replied.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Then he had everyone sit down on the grass and he then took the five loaves and two fish. He looked up into heaven, gave thanks to God, and broke the bread into pieces. He then gave it to his disciples, who in turn gave it to the crowds.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">And everyone ate until they were satisfied,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">for the food was multiplied in front of their eyes</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">They picked up the leftovers and filled up twelve baskets full!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">There were about five thousand men who were fed, in addition to many women and children!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">As soon as the people were fed, Jesus told his disciples to get into their boat and to go to the other side of the lake while he stayed behind to dismiss the people.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">After the crowds dispersed, Jesus went up into the hills to pray. And as night fell he was there praying alone.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">But the disciples, who were now in the middle of the lake, ran into trouble, for their boat was tossed about by the high winds and heavy seas.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">At about four o&apos;clock in the morning,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">Jesus came to them, walking on the waves!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">When the disciples saw him walking on top of the water, they were terrified and screamed, &apos;A ghost!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">Then Jesus said,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">&apos;Be brave and don&apos;t be afraid. I am here!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">Peter shouted out, &apos;Lord, if it&apos;s really you, then have me join you on the water!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">&apos;Come and join me,&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">Jesus replied. So Peter stepped out onto the water and began to walk toward Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">But when he realized how high the waves were, he became frightened and started to sink. &apos;Save me, Lord!&apos; he cried out.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">Jesus immediately stretched out his hand and lifted him up and said,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">&apos;What little faith you have! Why would you let doubt win?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">And the very moment they both stepped into the boat, the raging wind ceased.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">Then all the disciples bowed down</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">before him and worshiped Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">They said in adoration, &apos;You are truly the Son of God!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">After they crossed over and landed at Gennesaret,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">the people living there quickly recognized who he was. They were quick to spread the news throughout the surrounding region that Jesus had come to them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">So they brought him all their sick, begging him to let them touch the fringe of his cloak. And everyone who touched it was instantly healed!</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="15">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Then the Pharisees and religious scholars</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">came from Jerusalem and asked Jesus this question:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">&apos;Why do your disciples ignore the traditions of our elders? For example, they don&apos;t ceremonially wash their hands before they eat bread.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Jesus answered,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">&apos;And why do you ignore the commandment of God because of your traditions?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">For didn&apos;t God say, &apos;Honor your father and mother,&apos; and, &apos;Whoever abuses or insults his father or mother must be put to death?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">&apos;But you teach that it&apos;s permissible to say to your parents when they are in financial need, &apos;Whatever gift you would have received from me I can keep for myself, since I dedicated it as an offering to God.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">This doesn&apos;t honor your father or mother. And you have elevated your tradition above the words of God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Frauds and hypocrites! Isaiah described you perfectly when he said:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">These people honor me only with their words, for their hearts are so very distant from me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">They pretend to worship me, but their worship is nothing more than the empty traditions of men.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Then Jesus turned to the crowd and said,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">&apos;Come, listen and open your heart to understand.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">What truly contaminates a person is not what he puts into his mouth but what comes out of his mouth. That&apos;s what makes people defiled.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Then his disciples approached him and said, &apos;Don&apos;t you know that what you just said offended the Pharisees?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Jesus replied,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">&apos;Every plant that my heavenly Father didn&apos;t plant is destined to be uprooted.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Stay away from them,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">for they&apos;re nothing more than blind guides. Do you know what happens when a blind man pretends to guide another blind man? They both stumble into a ditch!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Peter spoke up and said, &apos;Will you explain to us what you mean by your parable?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Jesus said,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">&apos;Even after all that I&apos;ve taught you, you still remain clueless?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Is it hard to understand that whatever you eat enters the stomach only to pass out into the sewer?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">But what comes out of your mouth reveals the core of your heart. Words can pollute, not food.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">You will find living within an impure heart evil ideas, murderous thoughts, adultery, sexual immorality, theft, lies, and slander.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">That&apos;s what pollutes a person. Eating with unwashed hands doesn&apos;t defile anyone.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Then Jesus left and went north into the non-Jewish region of Lebanon.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">He encountered there a Canaanite woman</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">who shouted out to him, &apos;Lord, Son of David, show mercy to me! My daughter is horribly afflicted by a demon that torments her.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">But Jesus never answered her. So his disciples said to him, &apos;Why do you ignore this woman who is crying out to us?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">Jesus said,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">&apos;I&apos;ve only been sent to the lost sheep of Israel.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">But she came and bowed down before him and said, &apos;Lord, help me!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">Jesus responded,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">&apos;It&apos;s not right for a man to take bread from his children and throw it out to the dogs.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">&apos;You&apos;re right, Lord,&apos; she replied. &apos;But even puppies get to eat the crumbs that fall from the prince&apos;s table.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">Then Jesus answered her,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">&apos;Dear woman, your faith is strong! What you desire will be done for you.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">And at that very moment, her daughter was instantly set free from demonic torment.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">After leaving Lebanon, Jesus went to Lake Galilee and climbed a hill nearby and sat down.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">Then huge crowds of people streamed up the hill, bringing with them the lame, blind, deformed, mute, and many others in need of healing. They laid them at Jesus&apos; feet and he healed them all.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">And the crowds marveled with amazement, astounded over the things they were witnessing with their own eyes! The lame were walking, the mute were speaking, the crippled were made well, and the blind could see.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">For three days</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">everyone celebrated the miracles as they exalted and praised the God of Israel!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">Jesus called his disciples to himself and said,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">&apos;I care deeply about all these people, for they&apos;ve already been with me for three days without food. I don&apos;t want to send them away fasting or else they may be overcome by weakness on their journey home.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">The disciples said to him, &apos;Where in the world are we going to find enough food in this desolate place to feed this crowd?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">&apos;How many barley loaves do you have?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">Jesus asked. &apos;Seven,&apos; they replied, &apos;and a few small fish.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">So he gave the order,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">&apos;Have the people sit down on the grass.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">Then he took the seven loaves and the fish and gave thanks to God. He broke the bread and gave it to his disciples, who then distributed the food to the crowds.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">When everyone was full and satisfied, they gathered up the leftovers. And from what was once seven loaves and a few fish, they filled seven baskets!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">There were four thousand men who ate the food Jesus multiplied, and even more including the women and children!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">After dismissing the crowd, Jesus got into the boat and crossed over to the region of Magdala.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="16">
			<VERS vnumber="1">One day some of the Pharisees and those of the Jewish sect known as the Sadducees</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">approached Jesus, insisting that he prove to them that he was the Messiah. &apos;Show us a supernatural sign from heaven,&apos; they demanded.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Jesus answered,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">&apos;You can read the signs of the weather, for you say, &apos;Red sky at night, sailors delight.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">And, &apos;Red sky in the morning, sailors take warning.&apos; You&apos;re so adept at forecasting the weather by looking at the sky, but you&apos;re absolutely clueless in reading the obvious signs of the times.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">A wicked and wayward generation always asks for signs, but the only sign I provide for you will be the sign of Jonah the prophet.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Then he turned away and left them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Later, as Jesus and his disciples crossed over to the other side of Lake Galilee, the disciples realized they had forgotten to bring any loaves of bread.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Jesus spoke up and said,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">&apos;Watch out for the yeast of the Pharisees and the Sadducees.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Thinking Jesus was scolding them over not bringing bread, they began to discuss it among themselves.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Knowing their thoughts, Jesus said to them,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">&apos;You have such little faith! Why are you arguing with one another about having no bread?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Are you so slow to understand? Have you forgotten the miracle of feeding the five thousand families and how each of you ended up with a basket full of fragments?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">And how seven loaves of bread fed four thousand families with baskets left over?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Don&apos;t you understand? I&apos;m not talking about bread, but I&apos;m warning you to avoid the yeast of the Pharisees and the Sadducees.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Then finally they realized he wasn&apos;t talking about yeast found in bread, but the error of the teachings of the Pharisees</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">and the Sadducees.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">When Jesus came to Caesarea Philippi,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">he asked his disciples this question:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">&apos;What are the people saying about me, the Son of Man? Who do they believe I am?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">They answered, &apos;Some are convinced you are John the Baptizer, others say you are Elijah reincarnated, or Jeremiah, or one of the prophets.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">&apos;But you&apos;who do you say that I am?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Jesus asked.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Simon Peter spoke up and said, &apos;You are the Anointed One,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">the Son of the living God!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Jesus replied,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">&apos;You are favored and privileged Simeon, son of Jonah!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">For you didn&apos;t discover this on your own, but my Father in heaven has supernaturally revealed it to you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">I give you the name Peter,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">a stone</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">And this rock</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">will be the bedrock foundation on which I will build my church&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">my legislative assembly</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">and the power of death</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">will not be able to overpower it!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">I will give you the keys</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">of heaven&apos;s kingdom realm to forbid on earth that which is forbidden in heaven, and to release on earth that which is released in heaven.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">He then gave his disciples strict orders not to tell anyone that he was the Messiah.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">From then on Jesus began to clearly reveal to his disciples that he was destined to go to Jerusalem and suffer injustice</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">from the elders, leading priests, and religious scholars. He also explained that he would be killed and three days later be raised to life again.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Peter took him aside to correct him privately. He reprimanded Jesus over and over, saying to him, &apos;God forbid, Master! Spare yourself. You must never let this happen to you!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">Jesus turned to Peter</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">and said,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">&apos;Get out of my way, you Satan!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">You are a hindrance to me,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">because your thoughts are only filled with man&apos;s viewpoints and not with the ways of God.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">Then Jesus said to his disciples,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">&apos;If you truly want to follow me, you should at once completely reject and disown your own life. And you must be willing to share my cross and experience it as your own,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">as you continually surrender to my ways.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">For if you choose self-sacrifice and lose your lives for my glory, you will continually discover true life. But if you choose to keep your lives for yourselves, you will forfeit what you try to keep.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">For even if you were to gain all the wealth and power of this world&apos;at the cost of your own life&apos;what good would that be? And what could be more valuable to you than your own soul?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">I, the Son of Man, will one day return with my messengers</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">and in the splendor and majesty of my Father. And then I will reward each person according to what they have done.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">But I promise you, there are some standing here now who won&apos;t experience death until they have witnessed the coming of the Son of Man in the presence and the power of the kingdom realm of God!&apos;</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="17">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Six days later Jesus took Peter and the two brothers, Jacob and John, and hiked up a high mountain to be alone.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Then Jesus&apos; appearance was dramatically altered. A radiant light as bright as the sun poured from his face. And his clothing became luminescent&apos;dazzling like lightning.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">He was transfigured</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">before their very eyes.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Then suddenly, Moses and Elijah appeared,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">and they spoke with Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Peter blurted out, &apos;Lord, it&apos;s so wonderful that we are all here together! If you want, I&apos;ll construct three shrines,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">But while Peter was still speaking, a bright radiant cloud spread over them, enveloping them all.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">And God&apos;s voice suddenly spoke from the cloud, saying, &apos;This is my dearly loved Son, the constant focus of my delight.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Listen to him!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">The three disciples were dazed</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">and terrified by this phenomenon, and they fell facedown to the ground.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">But Jesus walked over and touched them, saying,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">&apos;Get up and stop being afraid.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">When they finally opened their eyes and looked around, they saw no one else there but Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">As they all hiked down the mountain together, Jesus ordered them,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">&apos;Don&apos;t tell anyone of the divine appearance</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">you just witnessed. Wait until the Son of Man is raised from the dead.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">His disciples asked him, &apos;Why do all the religious scholars insist that Elijah must first appear before the Anointed One comes?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">He answered them,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">&apos;They&apos;re right. Elijah must come first and restore all things.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">But Elijah has already appeared. And yet they didn&apos;t recognize him, so they did to him whatever they pleased. And the Son of Man is destined to suffer the same abuse as what they did to him.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Then the disciples realized that Jesus was referring to John the Baptizer all along.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">They came to where a large crowd had gathered</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">to wait for Jesus</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">. A man came and knelt before him</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">and said, &apos;Lord, please show your tender mercy toward my son.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">He has a demon who afflicts him</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">He has epilepsy, and he suffers horribly from seizures. He often falls into the cooking fire or into the river.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">I brought him to your followers, but they weren&apos;t able to heal him.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Jesus replied,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">&apos;Where is your faith? Can&apos;t you see how wayward and wrong this generation is?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">How much longer do I stay with you and put up with your doubts? Bring your son to me.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Then Jesus rebuked the demon and it came out of him and the boy was instantly healed!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Later the disciples came to him privately and asked, &apos;Why couldn&apos;t we cast out the demon?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">He told them,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">&apos;It was because of your lack of faith. I promise you, if you have faith inside of you no bigger than the size of a small mustard seed, you can say to this mountain, &apos;Move away from here and go over there,&apos; and you will see it move!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">There is nothing you couldn&apos;t do!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">But this kind is cast out only through prayer and fasting.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">When they all gathered together</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">in Galilee, Jesus said to them,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">&apos;The Son of Man is going to be betrayed and turned over to his enemies.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">They will kill him and in three days he will be resurrected.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">When the disciples heard these words they were devastated.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">After they arrived in Capernaum, the collectors of the temple tax approached Peter and asked, &apos;Does your teacher pay the tax for the upkeep of the temple, like the rest of us?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">&apos;Of course he does,&apos; Peter answered. When Peter walked into the house, and before he had a chance to speak, Jesus spoke up and said, &apos;Peter, I have a question for you. Who pays tolls or taxes to a king? Is tax collected from the king&apos;s own children, or from his subjects?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">&apos;From his subjects,&apos; Peter answered. Jesus replied, &apos;That&apos;s right. The children get off free without paying taxes.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">But so that we don&apos;t offend them, go to the lake and throw out your hook, and the first fish that rises up</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">will have a coin in its mouth. It will be the exact amount you need to pay the temple tax for both of us.&apos;</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="18">
			<VERS vnumber="1">At that time the disciples came to ask Jesus, &apos;Who is considered to be the greatest in heaven&apos;s kingdom realm?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Jesus called a little one</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">to his side and said to them,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">&apos;Learn this well: Unless you dramatically change your way of thinking and become teachable like a little child</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">, you will never be able to enter in.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Whoever continually humbles himself</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">to become like this little child is the greatest one in heaven&apos;s kingdom realm.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">And if you tenderly care for this little one</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">on my behalf, you are tenderly caring for me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">But if anyone abuses</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">one of these little ones who believes in me, it would be better for him to have a heavy boulder tied around his neck and be hurled into the deepest sea</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">than to face the punishment he deserves!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">&apos;Misery will come to the one who lures people away into sin. Troubles and obstacles to your faith are inevitable, but great devastation will come to the one guilty of causing others to stumble!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">If your hand clings to sin, cut it off and throw it away. If your foot continually steps onto sin&apos;s path, cut it off and throw it away. For it is better for you to enter into heaven crippled and maimed than to have both hands and both feet and be thrown into the eternal fire.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">And if your eye is always focusing on sin, pluck it out and throw it away. For it is better for you to enter into heaven with one eye than to be thrown into hell fire with two.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">&apos;Be careful that you not corrupt</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">one of these little ones. For I can assure you that in heaven each of their guardian angels</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">always sees the face of my heavenly Father.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">&apos;The Son of Man has come to give life to all who are lost.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Think of it this way: If a man owns a hundred sheep and one lamb wanders away and is lost, won&apos;t he leave the ninety-nine grazing the hillside and thoroughly search for the one lost lamb?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">And if he finds his lost lamb, he rejoices over it, more than over the ninety-nine that never went astray.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Now you should understand that it is never the desire of your heavenly Father that a single one of these little ones should be lost.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">&apos;If your fellow believer sins against you,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">you must go to that one privately and attempt to resolve the matter. If he responds, your relationship is restored.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">But if his heart is closed to you, then go to him again, taking one or two others with you. You&apos;ll be fulfilling what the Scripture teaches when it says, &apos;Every word may be verified by the testimony of two or three witnesses.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">And if he refuses to listen, then share the issue with the congregation</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">in hopes of restoration</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">. If he still refuses to respond, even to the church, then you must disregard him as though he were an outsider, on the same level as an unrepentant sinner.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">&apos;Receive this truth: Whatever you forbid on earth will be considered to be forbidden in heaven,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">and whatever you release on earth will be considered to be released in heaven.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Again, I give you an eternal truth: If two of you agree to ask God for something in a symphony of prayer,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">my heavenly Father will do it for you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">For wherever two or three come together in honor of my name,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">I am right there with them!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Later Peter approached Jesus and said, &apos;How many times do I have to forgive my fellow believer who keeps offending me? Seven times?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Jesus answered,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">&apos;Not seven times, Peter, but seventy times seven times!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">The lessons of forgiveness in heaven&apos;s kingdom realm can be illustrated like this: &apos;There once was a king who had servants who had borrowed money from the royal treasury. He decided to settle accounts with each of them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">As he began the process, it came to his attention that one of his servants</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">owed him one billion dollars.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">So he summoned the servant before him and said to him, &apos;Pay me what you owe me.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">When his servant was unable to repay his debt, the king ordered that he be sold as a slave along with his wife and children and every possession they owned as payment toward his debt.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">The servant threw himself facedown at his master&apos;s feet and begged for mercy. &apos;Please be patient with me. Just give me more time and I will repay you all that I owe.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">Upon hearing his pleas, the king had compassion on his servant, and released him, and forgave his entire debt.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">&apos;No sooner had the servant left when he met one of his fellow servants, who owed him twenty thousand dollars</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">He seized him by the throat and began to choke him, saying, &apos;You&apos;d better pay me right now everything you owe me!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">His fellow servant threw himself facedown at his feet and begged, &apos;Please be patient with me. If you&apos;ll just give me time, I will repay you all that is owed.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">But the one who had his debt forgiven stubbornly refused to forgive what was owed him. He had his fellow servant thrown into prison and demanded he remain there until he repaid the debt in full.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">&apos;When his associates saw what was going on, they were outraged and went to the king and told him the whole story.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">The king said to him, &apos;You scoundrel!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">Is this the way you respond to my mercy? Because you begged me, I forgave you the massive debt that you owed me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">Why didn&apos;t you show the same mercy to your fellow servant that I showed to you?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">In a fury of anger, the king turned him over to the prison guards to be tortured until all his debt was repaid.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">In this same way, my heavenly Father will deal with any of you if you do not release forgiveness from your heart</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">toward your fellow believer.&apos;</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="19">
			<VERS vnumber="1">After Jesus finished teaching them, he left Galilee and made his way toward the district of Judea, east of the Jordan River.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Massive crowds followed him and he healed all who were sick.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">The Pharisees were intent on putting Jesus to the test with difficult questions, so they approached him and asked, &apos;Is it lawful for a man to divorce</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">his wife for any reason?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">&apos;Haven&apos;t you read the Scriptures about creation?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Jesus replied.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">&apos;The Creator made us male and female from the very beginning,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">and &apos;For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and live with his wife.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">And the two will become one flesh.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">From then on, they are no longer two, but united as one. So what God unites let no one divide!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">They responded, &apos;So then why did Moses command us to give a certificate of divorce and it would be lawful?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Jesus said,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">&apos;Moses permitted you to divorce because your hearts are so hard and stubborn,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">but originally there was no such thing.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">But I say to you, whoever leaves his wife for any reason other than immorality, then takes another wife is living in adultery. And whoever takes a divorced woman in marriage is also living in adultery.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">His disciples spoke up and said, &apos;If this is the standard, then it seems better to never get married.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">&apos;Not everyone is meant to remain single&apos;only those whom God gives grace to be unmarried.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">For some are born to celibacy; others have been made eunuchs by others. And there are some who have chosen to live in celibacy for the sacred purpose of heaven&apos;s kingdom realm.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Let those who can, accept this truth for themselves.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Then they brought little children to Jesus so that he would lay his hands on them, bless them, and pray for them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">But the disciples scolded those who brought the children, saying, &apos;Don&apos;t bother him with this now!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Jesus overheard them and said,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">&apos;I want little children to come to me, so never interfere with them when they want to come, for heaven&apos;s kingdom realm is composed of beloved ones</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">like these! Listen to this truth: No one will enter the kingdom realm of heaven unless he becomes like one of these!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Then he laid his hands on each of them and went on his way.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Then a young man approached Jesus and bowed before him,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">saying, &apos;Wonderful teacher</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">&apos;is there a good work I have to do to obtain eternal life?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Jesus answered,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">&apos;Why would you call me wonderful? God alone is wonderful.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">And why would you ask what good work you need to do? Keep the commandments and you&apos;ll enter into the life of God.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">&apos;Which ones?&apos; he asked. Jesus said, &apos;Don&apos;t murder, don&apos;t commit adultery, don&apos;t steal, don&apos;t lie,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">honor your father and mother, and love those around you as you love yourself.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">&apos;But I&apos;ve always obeyed every one of them without fail,&apos; the young man replied. &apos;What else do I lack?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Jesus said to him,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">&apos;If you really want to be perfect,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">go now and sell everything you own. Give your money to the poor and your treasure will be transferred into heaven. Then come back and follow me for the rest of your life.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">When the young man heard these words, he walked away sad,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">for he had great wealth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">Then Jesus turned to his disciples and said,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">&apos;Listen. Do you understand how difficult it is for the rich to enter into heaven&apos;s kingdom realm?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">In fact, it&apos;s easier to stuff a heavy rope</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">through the eye of a needle than it is for the wealthy to enter into God&apos;s kingdom realm!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">Stunned and bewildered, his disciples asked, &apos;Then who in the world can possibly be saved?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">Looking into their eyes, Jesus replied,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">&apos;Humanly speaking, no one,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">because no one can save himself</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">. But what seems impossible to you is never impossible to God!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">Then Peter blurted out, &apos;Here we are. We&apos;ve given up everything to follow you. What reward will there be for us?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">Jesus responded,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">&apos;Listen to the truth: In the age of the restoration of all things,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">when the Son of Man sits on his glorious throne, you who have followed me will have twelve thrones of your own, and you will govern</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">the twelve tribes of Israel.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">For anyone who has left behind their home and property,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">leaving family&apos;brothers or sisters, mothers or fathers,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">or children&apos;for my sake, they will be repaid a hundred times over and will inherit eternal life.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">But many who push themselves to be first will find themselves last. And those who are willing to be last will find themselves to be first.&apos;</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="20">
			<VERS vnumber="1">&apos;This will help you understand the way heaven&apos;s kingdom operates: &apos;There once was a wealthy landowner who went out at daybreak to hire all the laborers he could find to work in his vineyard.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">After agreeing to pay them the standard day&apos;s wage, he put them to work.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Then at nine o&apos;clock, as he was passing through the town square, he found others standing around without work.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">He told them, &apos;Come and work for me in my vineyard and I&apos;ll pay you a fair wage.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">So off they went to join the others. He did the same thing at noon and again at three o&apos;clock, making the same arrangement as he did with the others.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">&apos;Hoping to finish his harvest that day, he went to the town square again at five o&apos;clock</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">and found more who were idle. So he said to them, &apos;Why have you been here all day without work?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">&apos; &apos;Because no one hired us,&apos; they answered. &apos;So he said to them, &apos;Then go and join my crew and work in my vineyard.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">&apos;When evening came, the owner of the vineyard went to his foreman and said, &apos;Call in all the laborers, line them up, and pay them the same wages, starting with the most recent ones I hired and finishing with the ones who worked all day.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">&apos;When those hired late in the day came to be paid, they were given a full day&apos;s wage.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">And when those who had been hired first came to be paid, they were convinced that they would receive more. But everyone was paid the standard wage.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">When they realized what had happened, they were offended and complained to the landowner, saying,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">&apos;You&apos;re treating us unfairly! They&apos;ve only worked for one hour while we&apos;ve labored and sweated all day under the scorching sun. You&apos;ve made them equal to us!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">&apos;The landowner replied, &apos;Friends, I&apos;m not being unfair&apos;I&apos;m doing exactly what I said. Didn&apos;t you agree to work for the standard wage?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">If I want to give those who only worked for an hour equal pay, what does that matter to you?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Don&apos;t I have the right to do what I want with what is mine? Why should my generosity make you jealous of them?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Now you can understand what I meant when I said that</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">the first will end up last and the last will end up being first. Everyone is invited, but few are the chosen.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Jesus was about to go to Jerusalem, so he took his twelve disciples aside privately and said to them,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">&apos;Listen to me. We&apos;re on our way to Jerusalem, and I need to remind you that the Son of Man will be handed over to the religious leaders and scholars, and they will sentence him to be executed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">And they will hand him over to the Romans</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">to be mocked, tortured, and crucified. Yet three days later he will be raised to life again.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">The wife of Zebedee approached Jesus with her sons, Jacob and John. She knelt before him and asked him for a favor.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">He said to her,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">&apos;What is it that you want?&apos; She answered, &apos;Make the decree that these, my sons, will rule with you in your kingdom&apos;one sitting on your right hand, one on your left.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Jesus replied,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">&apos;You don&apos;t know what you are asking.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Then, looking in the eyes of Jacob and John, Jesus said,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">&apos;Are you prepared to drink from the cup of suffering that I am about to drink? And are you able to endure the baptism into death that I am about to endure?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">They answered him, &apos;Yes, we are able.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">&apos;You will indeed drink the cup of my suffering and be immersed into my death,&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">Jesus told them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">&apos;But to be the ones who sit at the place of highest honor is not mine to decide. My Father is the one who chooses them and prepares them.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">The other ten disciples were listening to all of this, and a jealous anger arose among them against the two brothers.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">Jesus, knowing their thoughts, called them to his side and said,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">&apos;Kings and those with great authority in this world rule oppressively over their subjects, like tyrants.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">But this is not your calling. You will lead by a completely different model. The greatest one among you will live as the one who is called to serve others,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">because the greatest honor and authority is reserved for the one with the heart of a servant.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">For even the Son of Man did not come expecting to be served but to serve and give his life in exchange for the salvation of many.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">As Jesus left Jericho a huge crowd gathered and followed him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">And there were two blind men sitting on the roadside. When they heard that it was Jesus passing by, they shouted, &apos;Son of David,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">show us mercy, Lord!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">Those in the crowd scolded them and told them to be quiet. But the blind men shouted even louder, &apos;Jesus, Son of David, show us mercy, Lord!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">So Jesus stopped and had them brought to him. He asked them,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">&apos;What do you want me to do for you?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">They said, &apos;Lord, we want to see! Heal us!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">Jesus was deeply moved with compassion</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">toward them. So he touched their eyes, and instantly they could see! Jesus said to them,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">&apos;Your faith has healed you.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">And all the people praised God because of this miracle.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">And the two men became his followers from that day onward.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="21">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Now, as they were approaching Jerusalem they arrived at the place of the stables</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">near the Mount of Olives. Jesus sent two of his disciples ahead, saying,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">&apos;As soon as you enter the village, you will find a donkey tethered along with her young colt. Untie them both and bring them to me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">And if anyone stops you and asks, &apos;What are you doing?&apos; just tell them, &apos;The Lord of All needs them,&apos; and he will let you take them.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">All of this happened to fulfill the prophecy:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Tell Zion&apos;s daughter: &apos;Look, your King arrives! He&apos;s coming to you humbly, sitting on a donkey, riding on a donkey&apos;s colt.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">So the two disciples went on ahead and did as Jesus had instructed them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">They brought the donkey and her colt to him and placed their cloaks and prayer shawls on the colt, and Jesus rode on it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Then an exceptionally large crowd gathered and carpeted the road before him with their cloaks and prayer shawls.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Others cut down branches from trees to spread in his path.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Jesus rode in the center of the procession&apos;crowds going before him and crowds coming behind him, and they all shouted, &apos;Bring the victory, Lord,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Son of David! He is the blessed one sent from the Lord Yahweh!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">We celebrate with praises to God in the highest!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">As Jesus entered Jerusalem, the people went wild with excitement&apos;the entire city was thrown into an uproar!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Some asked, &apos;Who is this man?&apos; And the crowds shouted back, &apos;This is Jesus! He&apos;s the prophet from Nazareth</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">of Galilee!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Upon entering Jerusalem Jesus went directly into the temple area and drove away all the merchants who were buying and selling their goods. He overturned the tables of the money changers and the stands of those selling doves.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">And he said to them,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">&apos;My dwelling place will be known as a house of prayer, but you have made it into a hangout for thieves!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Then the blind and the crippled came into the temple courts, and Jesus healed them all. And the children circled around him shouting out, &apos;Blessings and praises to the Son of David!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">But when the chief priests and religious scholars heard the children shouting and saw all the wonderful miracles of healing, they were furious.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">They said to Jesus, &apos;Don&apos;t you hear what these children are saying? This is not right!&apos; Jesus answered, &apos;Yes, I hear them. But have you never read the Scripture, &apos;From the lips of children and infants you have ordained praise&apos;?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Jesus then left at once for the nearby village of Bethany, where he spent the night.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">While walking back into the city the next morning, he got hungry.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">He noticed a lone fig tree by the side of the path and walked over to see if there was any fruit on it, but there was none&apos;he found only leaves. So he spoke to the fig tree and said,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">&apos;You will be barren and will never bear fruit again!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Instantly the fig tree</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">shriveled up right in front of their eyes!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Astonished, his disciples asked, &apos;How did you make this fig tree instantly wither and die?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Jesus replied,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">&apos;Listen to the truth. If you do not doubt God&apos;s power and speak out of faith&apos;s fullness, you can also speak to a tree and it will wither away. Even more than that, you could say to this mountain, &apos;Be lifted up and be thrown into the sea&apos; and it will be done.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Everything you pray for with the fullness of faith you will receive!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">After this Jesus went into the temple courts and taught the people. The leading priests and Jewish elders approached him and interrupted him and asked, &apos;By what power</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">do you do these things, and who granted you the authority to teach here?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">Jesus answered them,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">&apos;I too have a question to ask you. If you can answer this question, then I will tell you by what power I do these things.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">Where did John&apos;s authority to baptize come from? From heaven or from people?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">They stepped away and debated among themselves, saying, &apos;How should we answer this? If we say from heaven, he will say to us, &apos;Then why didn&apos;t you respond to John and believe what he said?&apos; But if we deny that God gave John his authority, we&apos;ll be mobbed by the people, for they&apos;re convinced that John was God&apos;s prophet.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">So they finally answered, &apos;We don&apos;t know.&apos; &apos;Then neither will I tell you from where my power comes to do these things!&apos; he replied.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">Jesus said to his critics,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">&apos;Tell me what you think</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">of this parable</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">: &apos;There once was a man with two sons. The father came to the first and said, &apos;Son, I want you to go and work in the vineyard today.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">The son replied, &apos;I&apos;d rather not.&apos; But afterward, he deeply regretted what he said to his father, changed his mind, and decided to go to the vineyard.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">The father approached the second son and said the same thing to him. The son replied, &apos;Father, I will go and do as you said.&apos; But he never did&apos;he didn&apos;t go to the vineyard.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">Tell me now, which of these two sons did the will of his father?&apos; They answered him, &apos;The first one.&apos; Jesus said, &apos;You&apos;re right. For many sinners, tax collectors, and prostitutes are going into God&apos;s kingdom realm ahead of you!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">John came to show you the path of righteousness,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">yet the despised and outcasts believed in him, but you did not. When you saw them turn, you neither repented of your ways nor believed his words.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">&apos;Pay close attention to this parable,&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">Jesus said.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">&apos;There once was an honorable man who planted a vineyard.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">He built a fence around it,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">dug out a pit for pressing the grapes, and erected a watchtower. Afterward he leased the land to tenant farmers and then went a distance away.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">At harvest time he sent his servants to the tenants to collect the portion that was due him as the lord of the vineyard.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">But the tenants seized his servants and beat one, killed another, and stoned another.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">So the landowner sent other servants, even more than at first, but they were mistreated the same way.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">Finally, he sent his own son to them, and he said to himself, &apos;Perhaps with my own son standing before them they will be ashamed of what they&apos;ve done.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">But when the tenants saw the son, they said, &apos;This is the heir! Let&apos;s kill him and then we can have his inheritance!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">So they seized him, took him outside the vineyard, and murdered him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">&apos;You tell me, when the lord of the vineyard comes, what do you think he will do to those tenants?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">They answered, &apos;He will bring a horrible death to those who did this evil and he will completely destroy them. Then he&apos;ll lease his vineyard to different tenants who will be faithful to give him the portion he deserves.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">Jesus said to them,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">&apos;Haven&apos;t you ever read the Scripture that says: The very stone the builder rejected as flawed has now become the most important cornerstone. This was the Lord&apos;s plan &apos; isn&apos;t it marvelous to behold?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43">&apos;This is why I say to you that the kingdom realm of God will be taken from you and given to a people</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43">who will bear its fruit.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44">The one who comes against this stone</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44">will be broken, but the one on whom it falls will be pulverized!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45">When the leading priests and the Pharisees realized that the parable was referring to them, they were</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46">outraged and wanted to arrest him at once. But they were afraid of the reaction of the crowds, because the people considered him to be a prophet.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="22">
			<VERS vnumber="1">As was his custom, Jesus continued to teach the people by using allegories.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">He illustrated the reality of heaven&apos;s kingdom realm by saying,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">&apos;There once was a king who arranged an extravagant wedding feast for his son.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">On the day the festivities were set to begin, he sent his servants</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">to summon all the invited guests, but they chose not to come.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">So the king sent even more servants to inform the invited guests, saying, &apos;Come, for the sumptuous feast is now ready! The oxen and fattened cattle have been killed and everything is prepared, so come! Come to the wedding feast for my son and his bride!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">&apos;But the invited guests were not impressed. One was preoccupied with his business; another went off to his farming enterprise.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">And the rest seized the king&apos;s messengers and shamefully mistreated them, and even killed them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">This infuriated the king! So he sent his soldiers to execute those murderers and had their city burned to the ground.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">&apos;Then the king said to his servants, &apos;The wedding feast is ready, yet those who had been invited to attend didn&apos;t deserve the honor.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Now I want you to go into the streets and alleyways</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">and invite anyone and everyone you find to come and enjoy the wedding feast in honor of my son.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">&apos;So the servants went out into the city streets and invited everyone to come to the wedding feast, good and bad alike, until the banquet hall was crammed with people!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Now, when the king entered the banquet hall, he looked with glee over all his guests. But then he noticed a guest who was not wearing the wedding robe</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">provided for him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">So he said, &apos;My friend, how is it that you&apos;re here and you&apos;re not wearing your wedding garment?&apos; But the man was speechless.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">&apos;Then the king turned to his servants and said, &apos;Tie him up and throw him into the outer darkness,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">where there will be great sorrow, with weeping and grinding of teeth.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">For everyone is invited</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">to enter in, but few respond in excellence.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Then the Pharisees came together to make a plan to entrap Jesus with his own words.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">So they sent some of their disciples together with some staunch supporters of Herod.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">They said to Jesus, &apos;Teacher, we know that you&apos;re an honest man of integrity and you teach us the truth of God&apos;s ways. We can clearly see that you&apos;re not one who speaks only to win the people&apos;s favor, because you speak the truth without regard to the consequences.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">So tell us, then, what you think. Is it proper for us Jews to pay taxes to Caesar or not?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Jesus knew the malice that was hidden behind their cunning ploy and said,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">&apos;Why are you testing me, you imposters who think you have all the answers?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Show me one of the Roman coins.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">So they brought him a silver coin used to pay the tax.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">&apos;Now, tell me, whose head is on this coin and whose inscription is stamped on it?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">&apos;Caesar&apos;s,&apos; they replied. Jesus said, &apos;Precisely, for the coin bears the image of the emperor Caesar. Well, then, you should pay the emperor what is due to the emperor. But because you bear the image of God, give back to God all that belongs to him.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">The imposters were baffled in the presence of all the people. When they realized once again that they were unable to trap Jesus, they went away stunned.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">Some of the Sadducees, a religious group that denied there was a resurrection of the dead,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">came to ask Jesus this question:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">&apos;Teacher, the law of Moses teaches that if a man dies before he has children, his brother should marry the widow and raise up children for his brother&apos;s family line.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">Now, there was a family with seven brothers. The oldest got married but soon died, leaving his widow for his brother.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">The second brother married and also died, and the third also. This was repeated down to the seventh brother,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">when finally the woman also died. So here&apos;s our dilemma:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">Which of the seven brothers will be the woman&apos;s husband when she&apos;s resurrected from the dead, since they all were once married to her?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">Jesus answered them,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">&apos;You are deluded, because your hearts are not filled with the revelation of the Scriptures or the power of God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">For after the resurrection, men and women will not marry, just like the angels of heaven don&apos;t marry.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">Haven&apos;t you read what God said:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">&apos;I am the Living God,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob&apos;? God is not the God of the dead, but of the living.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">When the crowds heard this they were dazed and astonished over his teaching!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">When the Pharisees heard that Jesus had silenced the Sadducees, they called a meeting to discuss how to trap Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">Then one of them, a religious scholar, posed this question to test him:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">&apos;Teacher, which commandment in the law is the greatest?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">Jesus answered him,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">&apos; &apos;Love</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">the Lord your God with every passion of your heart, with all the energy of your being, and with every thought that is within you.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">This is the great and supreme commandment.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">And the second is like it in importance: &apos;You must love your friend</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">in the same way you love yourself.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">Contained within these commandments to love you will find all the meaning of the Law and the Prophets.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">While all the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus took the opportunity to pose a question of his own:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">&apos;What do you think about the Anointed One? Whose son is he?&apos; &apos;The son of David,&apos; they replied.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43">Then Jesus said to them,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43">&apos;How is it that David, inspired by the Holy Spirit, could call his son the Lord? For didn&apos;t he say:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44">The Lord said to my Lord, &apos;Sit beside me in the place of authority until I subdue all your enemies under your feet&apos;?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45">&apos;So how could David call his own son &apos;the Lord&apos;?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46">No one could come up with an answer. And from that day on none of the Pharisees had the courage to question Jesus any longer.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="23">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Then Jesus addressed both the crowds and his disciples and said,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">&apos;The religious scholars and the Pharisees sit in Moses&apos; seat</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">as the authorized interpreters of the Law.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">So listen and follow what they teach, but don&apos;t do what they do, for they tell you one thing and do another.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">They tie on your backs an oppressive burden of religious obligations and insist that you carry them, but will never lift a finger to help ease your load.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Everything they do is done for show and to be noticed by others.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">They want to be seen as holy</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">, so they wear oversized prayer boxes on their arms and foreheads with Scriptures inside, and wear extra-long tassels on their outer garments.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">They crave the seats of highest honor at banquets and in their meeting places.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">And how they love to be admired by men with their titles of respect, aspiring to be recognized in public and have others call them &apos;Reverend.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">&apos;But you are to be different from that. You are not to be called &apos;master,&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">for you have only one Master, and you are all brothers and sisters.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">And you are not to be addressed as &apos;father,&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">for you have one Father, who is in heaven.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Nor are you to be addressed as &apos;teacher,&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">for you have one Teacher, the Anointed One.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">The greatest among you will be the one who always serves others.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Remember this: If you have a lofty opinion of yourself and seek to be honored, you will be humbled. But if you have a modest opinion of yourself and choose to humble yourself, you will be honored.&apos;</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="16">Great sorrow awaits you, for you teach that there&apos;s nothing binding when you swear by God&apos;s temple, but if you swear by the gold of the temple, you are bound by your oath.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="17">Which is greater, the gold or the temple that makes the gold sacred?</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="20">Whoever swears by the altar swears by the altar and everything offered on it.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="25">&apos;Great sorrow awaits you religious scholars and Pharisees&apos;frauds and imposters! You are like one who will only wipe clean the outside of a cup or bowl, leaving the inside filthy. You are foolish to ignore the greed and self-indulgence that live like germs within you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">You are blind to your evil. Shouldn&apos;t the one who cleans the outside also be concerned with cleaning the inside? You need to have more than clean dishes; you need clean hearts!</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="29">&apos;Great sorrow awaits you religious scholars and Pharisees&apos;frauds and imposters! You build memorials for the prophets your ancestors killed and decorate the monuments of the godly people your ancestors murdered.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">Then you boast, &apos;If we had lived back then, we would not have joined them in killing the prophets.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">But your words and deeds testify that you are just like them and prove that you are indeed the descendants of those who murdered the prophets.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="34">&apos;For this reason I will send you more prophets and wise men and teachers of truth. Some you will crucify, and some you will beat mercilessly with whips in your meeting houses, abusing and persecuting them from city to city.</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="24">
			<VERS vnumber="1">As Jesus was leaving the temple courts, his disciples came to him and pointed out the beautiful architecture of the temple.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">And Jesus turned to them and said,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">&apos;Take a good look at all these things, for I&apos;m telling you, there will not be one stone left upon another. It will all be leveled!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Later, when they arrived at the Mount of Olives, his disciples came privately to where he was sitting and said, &apos;Tell us, when will these things happen? And what sign should we expect to signal your coming</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">and the completion of this age?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Jesus answered,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">&apos;At that time deception will run rampant. So beware that you are not fooled!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">For many will appear on the scene claiming my authority or saying about themselves, &apos;I am the Anointed One,&apos; and they will lead many astray.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">&apos;You will hear of wars and revolutions on every side, with more rumors of wars to come. Don&apos;t panic or give in to your fears, for the breaking apart of the world&apos;s systems is destined to happen. But it won&apos;t yet be the end; it will still be unfolding.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">&apos;Nations</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">will go to war against nations and kingdoms against kingdoms. And there will be terrible earthquakes, horrible epidemics,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">and famines in place after place.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">This is how the birth pains</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">of the new age will begin</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">&apos;You can expect to be persecuted, even killed; for you will be hated by all the nations because of your love for me.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="11">And many lying prophets will arise, deceiving multitudes and leading them away from the path of truth.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="21">For this will be a time of great misery beyond the magnitude of anything the world has ever seen or ever will see. Unless God limited those days, no one would escape.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">But because of his love for those chosen to be his, he will shorten that time of trouble.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="27">The appearing</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="45">&apos;What would qualify a servant to manage his master&apos;s house? He would be a wise servant who is both faithful and dependable. The master would commission him to oversee others, for he would lead them well and give them food at the right time.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="47">I can promise you, the master will raise him up and put him in charge of all that he owns.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="48">And because of the delay, the servant mistreats those in his master&apos;s household. Instead of caring for the ones he was appointed to serve,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="49">he abuses the other servants and begins to party with drunkards.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="50">Let me tell you what will happen to him. His master will suddenly return unexpectedly, and he will remove the abusive, selfish servant from his position of trust.</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="25">
			<VERS vnumber="1">&apos;When my coming draws near, heaven&apos;s kingdom realm can be compared to ten maidens who took their oil lamps and went outside to meet the bridegroom</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="10">&apos;While the five girls were out buying oil, the bridegroom appeared. Those who were ready and waiting were escorted inside with him and the wedding party to enjoy the feast. And then the door was locked.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="34">of the world!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">For when you saw me hungry, you fed me. When you found me thirsty, you gave me drink. When I had no place to stay, you invited me in,</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="26">
			<VERS vnumber="1">After Jesus had completed his teachings, he said to his disciples,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">&apos;You know that the Feast of the Passover begins in two more days. That&apos;s when the Son of Man will be betrayed and handed over to be crucified.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Meanwhile, the prominent priests and religious leaders of the nation were gathered in the palace of Caiaphas</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">the high priest.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">That&apos;s when they made their decision to secretly</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">have Jesus captured and killed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">But they all agreed, &apos;We can&apos;t do this during the Passover celebrations or we could have a riot on our hands.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">When the disciples saw this, they were offended. &apos;What a total waste!&apos; they grumbled.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">&apos;We could have sold it for a great deal of money and given it to the poor.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Jesus knew their thoughts and said to them,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">&apos;Why are you critical of this woman? She has done a beautiful act of kindness.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">You will always have someone poor whom you can help, but you will not always have me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">When she poured the fragrant oil over me, she was preparing my body for burial.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">I promise you that when this wonderful gospel spreads all over the world, the story of her lavish devotion to me will also be mentioned in memory of her.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">One of the twelve apostles, Judas the locksmith,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">went to the leading priests</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">and said, &apos;How much are you willing to pay me to betray Jesus into your hands?&apos; They agreed to pay him thirty silver coins.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Immediately Judas began to scheme and look for an opportunity to betray him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">On the first day of Passover,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">the day when all bread made with yeast was removed from every Jewish home, the disciples came to Jesus and asked, &apos;Where should we prepare the Passover meal</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">for you?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">He answered them,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">&apos;My heart longs with great desire to eat this Passover meal with you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Go into Jerusalem and you will encounter a man.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Tell him that the teacher says, &apos;My appointed time</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">is near. I am coming to your home to eat the Passover meal with my disciples.&apos; &apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">The disciples did as Jesus had instructed them, and they prepared the Passover meal.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">When evening came he took his place at the table and dined with the Twelve.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">While they were eating, Jesus spoke up and said,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">&apos;One of you is about to betray me.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Feeling deeply hurt by these words, one after another asked him, &apos;You don&apos;t mean me, do you?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">He answered,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">&apos;It is one who has shared meals with me as an intimate friend.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">All that was prophesied of me will take place, but how terrible it will be for the one who betrays the Son of Man. It would be far better for him if he had never been born!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">Then finally, Judas the traitor spoke up and asked him, &apos;Teacher,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">perhaps it is I?&apos; Jesus answered, &apos;You said it.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">As they ate, Jesus took the bread and blessed it and broke it and gave it to his disciples. He said to them,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">&apos;This is my body. Eat it.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">Then taking the cup of wine, he gave thanks to the Father, he entered into covenant with them,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">saying,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">&apos;This is my blood. Each of you must drink it in fulfillment of the covenant.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">For this is the blood that seals the new covenant.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">It will be poured out for many for the complete forgiveness of sins.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">The next time we drink this, I will be with you and we will drink it together with a new understanding in the kingdom realm of my Father.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">Then they sang a psalm</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">and left for the Mount of Olives.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">Along the way Jesus said to them,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">&apos;Before the night is over, you will all desert me. This will fulfill the prophecy of the Scripture that says: I will strike down the shepherd and all the sheep will scatter far and wide!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">&apos;But after I am risen, I will go ahead of you to Galilee and will meet you there.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">Then Peter spoke up and said, &apos;Even if all the rest lose courage and fall away, I will still be beside you, Jesus!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">&apos;Are you sure, Peter?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">Jesus said.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">&apos;In fact, before the rooster crows a few hours from now, you will have denied me three times.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">Peter replied, &apos;I absolutely will never deny you, even if I have to die with you!&apos; And all the others said the same thing.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">Then Jesus led his disciples to an orchard called &apos;The Oil Press.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">He told them,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">&apos;Sit here while I go and pray nearby.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">He took Peter, Jacob, and John with him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">However, an intense feeling of great sorrow plunged his soul into agony.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">And he said to them,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">&apos;My heart is overwhelmed and crushed with grief. It feels as though I&apos;m dying. Stay here and keep watch with me.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">Then he walked a short distance away, and overcome with grief, he threw himself facedown on the ground and prayed,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">&apos;My Father, if there is any way you can deliver me from this suffering,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">please take it from me. Yet what I want is not important, for I only desire to fulfill your plan for me.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">Then an angel from heaven appeared to strengthen him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">Later, he came back to his three disciples and found them all sound asleep. He awakened Peter and said to him,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">&apos;Could you not stay awake with me for even one hour?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">Keep alert and pray that you&apos;ll be spared from this time of testing. Your spirit is eager enough, but your humanity is weak.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">Then he left them for a second time to pray in solitude.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">He said to God</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">&apos;My Father, if there is not a way that you can deliver me from this suffering,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">then your will must be done.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43">He came back to the disciples and found them sound asleep, for they couldn&apos;t keep their eyes open.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44">So he left them and went away to pray the same prayer for the third time.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45">When he returned again to his disciples, he awoke them, saying,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45">&apos;Are you still sleeping? Don&apos;t you know the hour has come for the Son of Man to be handed over to the authority of sinful men?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46">Get up and let&apos;s go, for the betrayer has arrived.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="47">At that moment Judas, his once-trusted disciple, appeared, along with a large crowd of men armed with swords and clubs. They had been sent to arrest Jesus by order of the ruling priests and Jewish religious leaders.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="48">Now, Judas, the traitor, had arranged to give them a signal that would identify Jesus, for he had told them, &apos;Jesus is the one whom I will kiss. So seize him!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="49">Judas quickly stepped up to Jesus and said, &apos;Shalom, Rabbi,&apos; and he kissed him</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="49">on both cheeks</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="49">.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="50">&apos;My beloved friend,&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="50">Jesus said,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="50">&apos;is this why you&apos;ve come?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="50">Then the armed men seized Jesus to arrest him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="51">But one of the disciples</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="51">pulled out a dagger and swung it at the servant of the high priest, slashing off his ear.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="52">Jesus said to him,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="52">&apos;Put your dagger away. For all those who embrace violence will die by violence.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="53">Don&apos;t you realize that I could ask my heavenly Father for angels to come at any time to deliver me? And instantly he would answer me by sending more than twelve legions of angels</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="53">to come and protect us.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="54">But that would thwart the prophetic plan of God. For it has been written that it would happen this way.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="55">Then Jesus turned to the mob and said,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="55">&apos;Why would you arrest me with swords and clubs as though I were an outlaw? Day after day I sat in the temple courts with you, teaching the people, yet you didn&apos;t arrest me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="56">But all of this fulfills the prophecies of the Scriptures.&apos; At that point all of his disciples ran away and abandoned him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="57">Those who arrested Jesus led him</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="57">away to Caiaphas, the chief priest, and to a meeting where the religious scholars and the supreme Jewish council were already assembled.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="58">Now, Peter had followed the mob from a distance all the way to the chief priest&apos;s courtyard. And after entering, he sat with the servants</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="58">of the chief priest who had gathered there, waiting to see how things would unfold.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="59">The chief priests and the entire supreme Jewish council of leaders</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="59">were doing their best to bring false charges against Jesus, because they were looking for a reason to put him to death.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="60">Many false witnesses came forward, but the evidence could not be corroborated. Finally two men came forward</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="61">and declared, &apos;This man said, &apos;I can destroy God&apos;s temple and build it again in three days!&apos; &apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="62">Then the chief priest stood up and said to Jesus, &apos;Have you nothing to say about these allegations? Is what they&apos;re saying about you true?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="63">But Jesus remained silent before them. So the chief priest said to him, &apos;I charge you under oath&apos;in the name of the living God, tell us once and for all if you are the anointed Messiah, the Son of God!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="64">Jesus answered him,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="64">&apos;You just said it yourself. And more than that, you are about to see the Son of Man seated at the right hand of God, the Almighty.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="64">And one day you will also see the Son of Man coming in the heavenly clouds!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="65">This infuriated the chief priest, and as an act of outrage, he tore his robe and shouted, &apos;What blasphemy! No more witnesses are needed, for you heard this grievous blasphemy.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="66">Turning to the council he said, &apos;Now, what is your verdict?&apos; &apos;He&apos;s guilty and deserves the death penalty!&apos; they answered.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="67">Then they spat on his face and slapped him. Others struck him over and over with their fists.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="68">Then they taunted him by saying, &apos;Oh, Anointed One, prophesy to us! Tell us which one of us is about to hit you next?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="69">Meanwhile, Peter was still sitting outside in the courtyard when a servant girl came up to him and said, &apos;I recognize you. You were with Jesus the Galilean.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="70">In front of everyone Peter denied it and said, &apos;I don&apos;t have a clue what you&apos;re talking about.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="71">Later, as he stood near the gateway of the courtyard, another servant girl noticed him and said, &apos;I know this man is a follower of Jesus the Nazarene!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="72">Once again, Peter denied it, and with an oath he said, &apos;I tell you, I don&apos;t know the man!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="73">A short time later, those standing nearby approached Peter and said, &apos;We know you&apos;re one of his disciples&apos;we can tell by your speech. Your Galilean accent gives you away!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="74">Peter denied it, and using profanity he said, &apos;I don&apos;t know the man!&apos; At that very moment the sound of a crowing rooster pierced the night.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="75">Then Peter remembered the prophecy of Jesus, &apos;Before the rooster crows you will have denied me three times.&apos; With a shattered heart, Peter left the courtyard, sobbing with bitter tears.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="27">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Before dawn that morning, all the chief priests and religious leaders resolved to take action against Jesus and decided that he should be executed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">So they bound him and led him away to Pilate, the Roman governor.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Now, when Judas, the betrayer, saw that Jesus had been sentenced to death, remorse filled his heart. He returned the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and religious leaders,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">saying, &apos;I have sinned by betraying an innocent man.&apos; They replied, &apos;Why are you bothering us? That&apos;s your problem.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Then Judas flung the silver coins inside the temple and went out and hanged himself.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">The chief priests, picking up the pieces of silver, said, &apos;We can&apos;t keep this, for it&apos;s unlawful to put blood money into the temple treasury.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">So after some deliberation, they decided to purchase the potter&apos;s field</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">of clay</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">to use as a cemetery for burying strangers.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">That&apos;s why that land has been called &apos;The Field of Blood.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">This fulfilled the prophecy of Zechariah: They took the thirty pieces of silver, the price at which he was valued by the people of Israel, the price of a precious man,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">And they bought the potter&apos;s field, as the Lord directed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">As Jesus stood in front of the Roman governor, Pilate asked him, &apos;So, you are the king of the Jews?&apos; Jesus answered, &apos;You have just spoken it.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Then he was accused by the chief priests and religious leaders, but he remained silent.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Pilate said, &apos;Don&apos;t you hear these allegations?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">But Jesus offered no defense to any of the charges, much to the great astonishment of Pilate.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Now, every year at Passover it was the custom of the governor to pardon a prisoner and release him to the people&apos;anyone they wanted.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">And at that time, Pilate was holding in custody a notorious criminal named Jesus Barabbas.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">So as the crowds of people assembled outside of Pilate&apos;s residence, he went out and offered them a choice. He asked them, &apos;Who would you want me to release to you today, Jesus who is called Barabbas, or Jesus who is called the Anointed One?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">(Now, Pilate was fully aware that the religious leaders had handed Jesus over to him because of their bitter jealousy.)</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Just then, as Pilate was presiding over the tribunal,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">his wife sent him an urgent message: &apos;Don&apos;t harm that holy man,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">for I suffered a horrible nightmare last night about him!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Meanwhile, the chief priest and the religious leaders were inciting the crowd to ask for Barabbas to be freed and to have Jesus killed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">So Pilate asked them again, &apos;Which of the two men would you like me to release for you?&apos; They shouted, &apos;Barabbas.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Pilate asked them, &apos;Then what would you have me to do with Jesus who is called the Anointed One?&apos; They all shouted back, &apos;Crucify him!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">&apos;Why?&apos; Pilate asked. &apos;What has he done wrong?&apos; But they kept shouting out, &apos;Crucify him!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">When Pilate realized that a riot was about to break out and that it was useless to try to reason with the crowd, he sent for a basin of water. After washing his hands</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">in front of the people, he said, &apos;I am innocent of the blood of this righteous man.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">The responsibility for his death is now yours!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">And the crowd replied, &apos;Let his blood be on us and on our children!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">So he released Barabbas to the people. He ordered that Jesus be beaten with a whip of leather straps embedded with metal, and afterward be crucified.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">Then the guards took him into their military compound, where a detachment of nearly six hundred soldiers surrounded him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">They stripped off his clothing</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">and placed a scarlet robe on him to make fun of him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">Then they braided a crown of thorns and forcefully shoved it onto his head. After placing a reed staff in his right hand, they knelt down before him and mocked him, saying, &apos;Hail, king of the Jews!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">Then they spat in his face and took the reed staff from his hand and hit him repeatedly on his head,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">driving the crown of thorns deeper</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">When they finished ridiculing him, they took off the scarlet robe and put his own clothes back on him and led him away to be crucified.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">And as they came out of the city, they stopped an African man named Simon, from Libya,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">and compelled him to carry the cross for Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">They brought Jesus to Golgotha, which means &apos;Skull Hill.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">And there the soldiers offered him a mild painkiller, a drink of wine mixed with gall,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">but after tasting it, he refused to drink it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">Then they crucified Jesus, nailing his hands and feet to the cross. The soldiers divided his clothing among themselves by rolling dice to see who would win them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">And the soldiers stood there to watch what would happen and to keep guard over him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">Above his head they placed a sign that read, &apos;This is Jesus of Nazareth,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">King of Israel.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">Two criminals were also crucified with Jesus, one on each side of him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">And those who passed by shook their heads and ridiculed him,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">saying, &apos;We heard you boast that you could destroy the temple and rebuild it in three days! Why don&apos;t you save yourself now? If you&apos;re really God&apos;s Son, come down from the cross!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">Even the ruling priests, with the Jewish scholars and religious leaders, joined in the mockery</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">and kept on saying, &apos;He saved others, but he can&apos;t even save himself! Israel&apos;s king, is he? He should pull out the nails and come down from the cross right now; then we&apos;ll believe in him!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43">He puts his trust in God, so let&apos;s see if it&apos;s true, and see if God really wants to rescue him, for he said, &apos;I am the Son of God.&apos; &apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44">Even the two criminals who were crucified with Jesus began to taunt him, hurling their insults on him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45">For three hours, beginning at noon,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45">a sudden and unexpected</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45">darkness came over the earth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46">And at three o&apos;clock Jesus shouted with a mighty voice in Aramaic,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46">&apos;Eli, Eli, lema sabachthani?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46">&apos;that is,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46">&apos;My God, My God, why have you deserted me?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="47">Some who were standing near the cross misunderstood and said, &apos;He&apos;s calling for Elijah.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="48">One bystander ran and got a sponge, soaked it with sour wine, then put it on a stick and held it up for Jesus to drink.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="49">But the rest said, &apos;Leave him alone! Let&apos;s see if Elijah comes to rescue him.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="50">Jesus passionately cried out,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="50">took his last breath</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="50">, and gave up his spirit.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="51">At that moment the veil in the Holy of Holies was torn in two from the top to the bottom.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="51">The earth shook violently, rocks were violently split apart,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="52">and graves were opened. Then many of the holy ones who had died were brought back to life and came out of their graves.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="53">And after Jesus&apos; resurrection,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="53">they were seen by many people walking in Jerusalem.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="54">Now, when the Roman military officer and his soldiers witnessed what was happening and felt the powerful earthquake, they were extremely terrified. They said, &apos;There is no doubt, this man was the Son of God!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="55">Watching from a distance were many of the women who had followed him from Galilee and given him support.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="56">Among them were Mary Magdalene; Mary, the mother of Jacob and Joseph; and the mother of Jacob and John.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="57">At the end of the day, a wealthy man named Joseph, a follower of Jesus from the village of Ramah,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="58">approached Pilate and asked if he could take custody of the body of Jesus. So Pilate consented and ordered that the body be given to him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="59">Then Joseph wrapped the body in a shroud of fine linen and placed it in his own unused tomb, which had only recently been cut into the rock.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="60">They rolled a large stone to seal the entrance of the tomb and left.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="61">Sitting across from the tomb were Mary Magdalene and the other Marys,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="61">watching all that took place.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="62">The next day, the day after Preparation Day for Passover, the chief priests and the Pharisees went together to Pilate.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="63">They said to him, &apos;Our master, we remember that this imposter claimed that he would rise from the dead after three days.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="64">So please, order the tomb to be sealed until after the third day. Seal it so that his disciples can&apos;t come and steal the corpse and tell people he rose from the dead. Then the last deception would be worse than the first!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="65">&apos;I will send soldiers to guard the tomb,&apos; Pilate replied. &apos;Go with them and make the tomb as secure as possible.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="66">So they left and sealed the stone,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="66">and Pilate&apos;s soldiers secured the tomb.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="28">
			<VERS vnumber="1">After the Sabbath ended, at the first light of dawn on the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">went to take a look at the tomb.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">The women were breathless and terrified, until the angel said to them, &apos;There&apos;s no reason to be afraid. I know you&apos;re here looking for Jesus, who was crucified.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">He isn&apos;t here&apos;he has risen victoriously,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">just as he said! Come inside the tomb and see the place where our Lord was lying.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Then run and tell his disciples that he has risen from the dead! I give you his message: &apos;I am going ahead of you to Galilee and you will see me there.&apos; &apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">They rushed quickly to tell his disciples, and their hearts were filled with fear, awe, and great joy at the same time.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Along the way, Jesus suddenly appeared in front of them and said,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">&apos;Rejoice!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">They were so overwhelmed by seeing him that they bowed down and grasped his feet in adoring worship.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Then Jesus said to them,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">&apos;Throw off all your fears. Go and tell my brothers</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">to go to Galilee. They will find me there.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">After the women left the tomb, a few of the guards went into Jerusalem and told the chief priests everything they had seen and heard.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">So the chief priests called a meeting with all the religious leaders and came up with a plan. They bribed the guards with a large sum of money</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">and told them, &apos;Tell everyone, &apos;While we were asleep, his disciples came at night and stole his body!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">If Pilate finds out about this, don&apos;t worry. We&apos;ll make sure you don&apos;t get blamed.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">So they took the money and did as they were told. (That is why the story of the guards is still circulated among the Jews to this day.)</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Meanwhile, the eleven disciples heard the wonderful news from the women and left for Galilee, to the mountain where Jesus had arranged to meet them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">The moment they saw him, they worshiped him, but some still had lingering doubts.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Then Jesus came close to them and said,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">&apos;All authority of the universe has been given to me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Now wherever you go, make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">And teach them to faithfully follow</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">all that I have commanded you. And never forget that I am with you every day, even to the completion of this age.&apos;</VERS>

	<BIBLEBOOK bnumber="41" bname="Mark">
		<CHAPTER cnumber="1">
			<VERS vnumber="1">This is the beginning of the wonderful news about Jesus</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">the Messiah, the Son of God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">It starts with Isaiah the prophet, who wrote: Listen! I am sending my messenger ahead of you and he will prepare your way!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">He is a thunderous voice of one who shouts in the wilderness: &apos;Prepare your hearts for the coming of the Lord Yahweh, and clear a straight path inside your hearts for him!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">John the Baptizer</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">was the messenger who appeared in the wilderness, preaching a baptism of repentance</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">for the complete cancellation of sins.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">A steady stream of people came to be dipped in the Jordan River as they publicly confessed their sins. They came from all over southern Israel,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">including nearly all the inhabitants of Jerusalem.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">John wore a rough garment made from camel hair,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">with a leather belt around his waist,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">and he ate locusts and honey.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">And this is the message he kept preaching: &apos;There is a man coming after me who is greater and a lot more powerful than I am. I&apos;m not even worthy to bend down and untie the strap of his sandals.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">I&apos;ve baptized you into water, but he will baptize you into the Spirit of Holiness!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">One day, Jesus came from the Galilean village of Nazareth</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">and had John immerse him in the Jordan River.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">The moment Jesus rose up out of the water, John saw the heavenly realm split open, and the Holy Spirit descended upon him like a dove.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">At the same time, a voice spoke from heaven, saying: &apos;You are my Son, my cherished one, and my greatest delight is in you!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Immediately after this he was compelled by the Holy Spirit</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">to go into an uninhabited desert region.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">He remained there in the wilderness for forty days,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">enduring the ordeals of Satan&apos;s tests. He encountered wild animals, but also angels who appeared and ministered to his needs.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Later on, after John the Baptizer was arrested, Jesus went back into the region of Galilee and preached the wonderful gospel of God&apos;s kingdom.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">His message was this:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">&apos;At last the fulfillment of the age has come! It is time for God&apos;s kingdom to be experienced in its fullness!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Turn your lives back to God and put your trust in the hope-filled gospel!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">As Jesus was walking along the shore of Lake Galilee, he noticed two brothers fishing: Simon and Andrew. He watched them as they were casting their nets into the sea</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">and said to them,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">&apos;Come follow me and I will transform you into fishers of men instead of fish!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Immediately they dropped their nets and left everything behind to follow Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Walking a little farther, Jesus found two other brothers sitting in a boat, along with their father, mending their nets. Their names were Jacob</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">and John, and their father Zebedee.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Jesus immediately walked up to them and invited the two brothers to become his followers. Jacob and John dropped their nets, stood up, left their father in the boat with the hired men, and followed Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Then Jesus and his disciples went to Capernaum,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">and he immediately started teaching on the Sabbath day in the synagogue.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">The people were awestruck</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">by his teaching, because he taught in a way that demonstrated</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">God&apos;s</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">authority, which was quite unlike the religious scholars.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">Suddenly, during the meeting, a demon-possessed man screamed out,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">&apos;Hey! Leave us alone! Jesus the victorious,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">I know who you are. You&apos;re God&apos;s Holy One and you have come to destroy us!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">Jesus rebuked him, saying,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">&apos;Silence! You are bound!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">Come out of him!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">The man&apos;s body shook violently in spasms, and the demon hurled him to the floor until it finally came out of him with a deafening shriek!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">The crowd was awestruck and kept saying among themselves, &apos;What is this new teaching that comes with such authority? With merely a word he commands demons to come out and they obey him!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">So the reports about Jesus spread like wildfire throughout every community in Galilee.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">Now, as soon as they left the meeting, they went straight to Simon and Andrew&apos;s house, along with Jacob and John.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">Simon&apos;s mother-in-law was bedridden, sick with a high fever, so the first thing they did was to tell Jesus about her.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">He walked up to her bedside, gently took her hand, and raised her up! Her fever disappeared and she began to serve them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">Later in the day,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">just after the Sabbath ended</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">at sunset, the people kept bringing to Jesus all who were sick and tormented by demons,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">until the whole village was crowded around the house.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">Jesus healed many who were sick</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">with various diseases and cast out many demons. But he would not permit the demons to speak, because they knew who he really was.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">The next morning, Jesus got up long before daylight, left the house while it was dark, and made his way to a secluded place to give himself to prayer.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">Later, Simon and his friends searched for him,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">and when they finally tracked him down, they told him, &apos;Everyone is looking for you&apos;they want you!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">Jesus replied,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">&apos;We have to go on to the surrounding villages so that I can share my message with the people there, for that is my mission.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">So he went throughout the region of Galilee, preaching in the Jewish synagogues and casting out demons.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">On one occasion, a leper came and threw himself down in front of Jesus, pleading for his healing, saying, &apos;You have the power to heal me right now if only you really want to!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">Being deeply moved with tender compassion,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">Jesus reached out and touched the skin of the leper and told him,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">&apos;Of course I want you to be healed&apos;so now, be cleansed!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">Instantly his leprous sores completely disappeared and his skin became smooth!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43">Jesus sent him away with a very stern warning,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44">saying,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44">&apos;Don&apos;t say anything to anyone</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44">about what just happened</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44">, but go find a priest and show him that you&apos;ve been healed. Then bring the offering that Moses commanded for your cleansing as a living testimony to everyone.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45">But no sooner did the man leave than he began to proclaim his healing publicly</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45">and tell the story everywhere. Jesus&apos; growing fame prevented him from entering the villages openly, which forced him to remain in isolated places. Even so, a steady stream of people flocked to him from everywhere.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="2">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Several days later, Jesus returned to Capernaum, and the news quickly spread that he was back in town.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Soon there were so many people crowded inside the house to hear him that there was no more room, even outside the door. While Jesus was preaching the word of God,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">four men arrived, carrying a paralyzed man.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">But when they realized that they couldn&apos;t even get near him because of the crowd, they went up on top of the house and tore away the roof above Jesus&apos; head. And when they had broken through, they lowered the paralyzed man on a stretcher</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">right down in front of him</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">When Jesus saw the extent of their faith, he said to the paralyzed man,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">&apos;My son, your sins are now forgiven.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">This offended some of the religious scholars who were present, and they reasoned among themselves,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">&apos;Who does he think he is to speak this way? This is blasphemy for sure! Only God himself can forgive sins!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Jesus supernaturally perceived their thoughts and said to them,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">&apos;Why are you being so skeptical?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Which is easier, to say to this paralyzed man, &apos;Your sins are now forgiven,&apos; or, &apos;Stand up and walk!&apos;?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">But to convince you that the Son of Man has been given authority to forgive sins,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">I say to this man, &apos;Stand up, pick up your stretcher, and walk home.&apos; &apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Immediately the man was healed and sprang to his feet in front of everyone and left for home. When the crowd witnessed this miracle, they were awestruck. They shouted praises to God and said, &apos;We&apos;ve never seen anything like this before!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Jesus went out to walk near Lake Galilee, and a massive crowd gathered, so he taught them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">As he walked along, he found Levi, the son of Alphaeus,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">sitting at a tax booth, collecting taxes. He approached him and said,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">&apos;Come follow me.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Immediately he got up from his booth and began to follow Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Later, Jesus and his disciples went to have a meal with Levi. Among the guests in Levi&apos;s home were many tax collectors and notable sinners sharing a meal with Jesus, for there were many kinds of people who followed him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">But when the religious scholars and the Pharisees</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">found out that Jesus was keeping company and dining with sinners and tax collectors,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">they were indignant. So they approached Jesus&apos; disciples and said to them, &apos;Why is it that someone like Jesus</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">defiles himself</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">by eating with sinners and tax collectors?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">But when Jesus overheard their complaint, he said to them,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">&apos;Who goes to the doctor for a cure? Those who are well or those who are sick? I have not come to call the &apos;righteous,&apos; but those who are sinners and bring them to repentance.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">One time, the disciples of John the Baptizer and the Pharisees were fasting. So they came to Jesus and asked, &apos;Why is it that John&apos;s disciples and disciples of the Pharisees are fasting but your disciples are not?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Jesus answered,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">&apos;How can the sons of the bridal chamber fast when the bridegroom is next to them? As long as the bridegroom is with them they won&apos;t,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">but the days of fasting will come when the Bridegroom is taken from them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">&apos;And who would mend worn-out clothing with new fabric? When the new cloth shrinks, it will rip, making the tear worse than before.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">And who would pour new wine into an old wineskin? Eventually the wine will ferment and make the wineskin burst, losing everything&apos;the wine will be spilled and the wineskin ruined. Instead, new wine is always poured into new wineskins.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">One Sabbath,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">Jesus and his disciples were walking through a field of wheat. The disciples were hungry, so they plucked off some heads of grain to eat.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">But when some of the Pharisees saw what was happening, they said to him, &apos;Look! Your disciples shouldn&apos;t be harvesting grain on the Sabbath!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">Jesus responded,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">&apos;Haven&apos;t you ever read what King David and his men did when they were hungry?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">They entered the house of God</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">when Abiathar was high priest and ate the sacred bread of God&apos;s presence.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">They violated the law by eating bread that only the priests were allowed to eat. But there is one here who is even greater than the temple.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">Then he said to them,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">&apos;The Sabbath was made for the sake of people, and not people for the Sabbath.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">For this reason the Son of Man exercises his lordship over the Sabbath.&apos;</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="3">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Then Jesus left them and went again into the synagogue, where he encountered a man who had an atrophied, paralyzed hand.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Everyone was watching Jesus closely to see if he would heal the man on the Sabbath, giving them a reason to accuse him</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">of breaking Sabbath rules</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Jesus said to the man with the paralyzed hand,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">&apos;Stand here in the middle of the room.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Then he turned to all those gathered there and said,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">&apos;Is it against the law to do evil on the Sabbath or to do good? To destroy a life or to save one?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">But no one answered him a word.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Then looking around at everyone, Jesus was moved with indignation and grieved by the hardness of their hearts and said to the man,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">&apos;Now stretch out your hand!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">As he stretched out his hand, it was instantly healed!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">After this happened, the Pharisees left abruptly and began to plot together with the friends and supporters of Herod Antipas on how they would kill Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Once again Jesus withdrew with his disciples to the lakeside, but a massive crowd of people followed him from all around the provinces of Galilee and southern Israel.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Vast crowds came from Jerusalem, Idumea,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">beyond the Jordan, and from Lebanon.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Large numbers of people swarmed in from everywhere when they heard of him and his wonderful works.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">The crowd pressed so closely to Jesus that he instructed his disciples to bring him a small boat to get into and keep from being crushed by the crowd.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">For he had healed so many that the sick kept pushing forward</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">just so they could touch Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">And whenever a demon saw him, it would throw the person down at Jesus&apos; feet, screaming out, &apos;You are the Son of God!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">But Jesus would silence the demons and sternly order them not to reveal who he was.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Afterward, Jesus went up on a mountainside and called to himself the men he wanted to be his close companions, so they went up with him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">He appointed</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">the Twelve, whom he named apostles.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">He wanted them to be continually at his side as his friends, and so that he could send them out to preach</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">and have authority to heal the sick and to cast out demons.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">He appointed his Twelve</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">and gave Simon the nickname Peter the Rock.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">And he gave the brothers, Jacob and John, the sons of Zebedee, the nickname</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Benay-Regah</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">which means &apos;passionate sons.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">The others were Andrew, Philip, Bartholomew,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Matthew, Thomas, Jacob the son of Alphaeus, Thaddaeus,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Simon the Nationalist,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">and Judas Iscariot,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">who betrayed him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Then Jesus went home,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">but once again a large crowd gathered around him, which prevented him from even eating a meal.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">When his own family heard that he was there, they went out to seize him, for they said, &apos;He&apos;s insane!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">The religious scholars who arrived from Jerusalem were saying, &apos;Satan</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">has possessed him! He casts out demons by the authority of the prince of demons!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">Jesus called them to himself and spoke to them using parables.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">&apos;How can Satan cast out Satan?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">No kingdom can endure if it is divided against itself,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">and a fragmented household will not be able to stand, for it is divided.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">And if Satan fights against himself he will not endure, and his end has come.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">Jesus said to them,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">&apos;Listen. No one is able to break into a mighty man&apos;s house and steal his property unless he first overpowers the mighty man and ties him up.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">Then his entire house can be plundered and his possessions taken.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">I tell you this timeless truth: All sin will be forgiven, even all the blasphemies that are spoken.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">But there can never be forgiveness for the one who blasphemes against the Holy Spirit, for he is guilty of an eternal sin!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">(This is because they said he was empowered by a demon spirit.)</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">Then Jesus&apos; mother and his brothers came and stood outside and sent a message to him, asking that he come out and speak with them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">When the crowd sitting around Jesus heard this, they spoke up, and said to him, &apos;Jesus, your mother and brothers</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">are outside looking for you.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">He answered them,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">&apos;Who is my true mother and my true brothers?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">Then looking in the eyes of those who were sitting in a circle around him, he said,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">&apos;Here are my true family members.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">For whoever does the will of God is my brother, my sister, and my mother!&apos;</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="4">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Once again Jesus went to teach the people at the shore of Lake Galilee</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">and a massive crowd surrounded him. The crowd was so huge that he had to get into a boat and teach the people from there.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">He taught them many things by using parables</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">to illustrate spiritual truths, saying:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">&apos;Consider this: A sower went out to sow.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">As he sowed some fell along the beaten path and soon the birds came and ate it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Some fell onto gravel with no topsoil and quickly sprouted since the soil had no depth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">But when the days grew hot, the sprouts were scorched and withered because they had insufficient roots.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Some fell among the thorns, and the thorns grew up and choked it, and it yielded no fruit.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">But some fell onto good, rich soil that kept producing a good harvest. Some yielded thirty, some sixty&apos;and some a hundredfold!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">If you understand this, then you need to respond.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Afterward, Jesus&apos; disciples and those close to him remained behind to ask Jesus about his parables.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">He said to them,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">&apos;The privilege of intimately knowing the mystery of God&apos;s kingdom realm has been granted to you, but not to the others,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">where everything is revealed in parables.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">&apos;For even when they see what I do, they will not understand, and when they hear what I say, they will learn nothing, otherwise they would repent and be forgiven.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Then he said to them,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">&apos;If you don&apos;t understand this parable, how will you understand any parable?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Let me explain: The farmer sows the</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">message of the kingdom.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">What falls on the beaten path represents those who hear the message, but immediately Satan appears and snatches it from their hearts.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">And what is sown on gravel represents those who hear the message and receive it joyfully,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">but because their hearts fail to sink a deep root, they don&apos;t endure for long. For when trouble or persecution comes on account of the message, they immediately wilt and fall away.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">And what is sown among thorns represents those who hear the message,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">but they allow the cares of this life and the seduction of wealth and the desires for other things to crowd out and choke the message so that it produces nothing.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">&apos;But what is sown on good soil represents those who open their hearts to receive the message and their lives bear good fruit&apos;some yield a harvest of thirty, sixty, even a hundredfold!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">He also gave them this parable:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">&apos;No one lights a lamp</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">only to place it under a basket or under the bed. It is meant to be placed on a lampstand.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">For there is nothing that is hidden that won&apos;t be disclosed, and there is no secret that won&apos;t be brought out into the light!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">If you understand what I&apos;m saying, you need to respond!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">Then he said to them,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">&apos;Be diligent to understand the meaning behind everything you hear, for as you do, more understanding will be given to you. And according to your longing to understand,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">much more will be added to you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">For those who listen with open hearts will receive more revelation. But those who don&apos;t listen with open hearts will lose what little they think they have!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">Jesus also told them this parable:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">&apos;God&apos;s kingdom realm is like someone spreading seed on the ground.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">He goes to bed and gets up, day after day, and the seed sprouts and grows tall, though he knows not how.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">All by itself it sprouts, and the soil produces a crop; first the green stem, then the head on the stalk, and then the fully developed grain in the head.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">Then, when the grain is ripe, he immediately puts the sickle to the grain, because harvest time has come.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">And he told them this parable:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">&apos;How can I describe God&apos;s kingdom realm? Let me illustrate it with this parable.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">It is like the mustard seed, the tiniest of all the seeds,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">yet when it springs up and grows, it becomes the largest plant in the garden, with so many large spreading branches, even birds can nest in its shade.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">Jesus used many parables such as these as he taught the people, and they learned according to their ability to understand.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">He never spoke to them without using parables, but would wait until he was alone with his disciples to explain to them their meanings.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">That same day, after it grew dark, Jesus said to his disciples,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">&apos;Let&apos;s cross over to the other side of the lake.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">Leaving the crowd behind, the disciples got into the boat in which Jesus was already sitting, and they took him with them. Other boats sailed with them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">Suddenly, as they were crossing the lake, a ferocious storm arose, with violent winds and waves that were crashing into the boat until it was nearly swamped.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">But Jesus was calmly sleeping in the stern, resting on a cushion.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">So they shook him awake, saying, &apos;Teacher, don&apos;t you even care that we are all about to die!&apos; Fully awake, he rebuked the storm and shouted to the sea,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">&apos;Hush! Be still!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">All at once the wind stopped howling and the water became perfectly calm.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">Then he turned to his disciples and said to them,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">&apos;Why are you so afraid? Haven&apos;t you learned to trust yet?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">But they were overwhelmed with fear and awe and said to one another, &apos;Who is this man who has such authority that even the wind and waves obey him?&apos;</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="5">
			<VERS vnumber="1">They arrived at the other side of the lake, at the region of the Gerasenes.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">As Jesus stepped ashore, a demon-possessed madman came out of the graveyard and confronted him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">The man had been living there among the tombs, and no one was able to restrain him, not even with chains.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">For every time they attempted to chain his hands and feet with shackles, he would snap the chains and break the shackles in pieces. He was so strong that no one had the power to subdue him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Day and night he could be found lurking in the cemetery or in the vicinity, shrieking and cutting himself with stones!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">When he saw Jesus from a distance, he ran to him and threw himself down before him,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">shouting at the top of his lungs, &apos;Leave me alone, Jesus, Son of the Most High God! Swear in God&apos;s name that you won&apos;t torture me!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">(For Jesus had already said to him,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">&apos;Come out of that man, you demon spirit!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">)</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Jesus said to him,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">&apos;What is your name?&apos; &apos;Mob,&apos; he answered. &apos;They call me Mob because there are thousands of us in his body!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">He begged Jesus repeatedly not to expel them out of the region.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Nearby there was a large herd of pigs feeding on the hillside.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">The demons begged him, &apos;Send us into the pigs. Let us enter them!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">So Jesus gave them permission, and the demon horde immediately came out of the man and went into the pigs! This caused the herd to rush madly down the steep slope and fall into the lake, drowning about two thousand pigs!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">At this, the herdsmen ran to the nearby villages, telling everyone along the way what had happened, and the people came out to see for themselves.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">When they found Jesus, they saw the demonized man sitting there, properly clothed and in his right mind. Seeing what had happened to the man possessed by many demons, the people became afraid.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Those who had witnessed</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">this miracle</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">reported the news to the people and included what had happened to the pigs.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Then they asked Jesus to leave their region.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">And as Jesus began to get into the boat to depart, the man who had been set free from demons asked him, &apos;Could I go with you?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Jesus answered,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">&apos;No,&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">but said to him,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">&apos;Go back to your home and to your family and tell them what the Lord has done for you. Tell them how he had mercy on you.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">So the man left and went into the region of Jordan and parts of Syria</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">to tell everyone he met about what Jesus had done for him, and all the people marveled!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">After Jesus returned from across the lake, a huge crowd of people quickly gathered around him on the shoreline.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Just then, a man saw that it was Jesus, so he pushed through the crowd and threw himself down at his feet. His name was Jairus,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">a Jewish official who was in charge of the synagogue.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">He pleaded with Jesus, saying over and over, &apos;Please come with me! My little daughter is at the point of death,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">and she&apos;s only twelve years old</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">Come and lay your hands on her and heal her and she will live!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">Immediately Jesus went with him, and the huge crowd followed, pressing in on him from all sides.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">Now, in the crowd that day was a woman who had suffered horribly from continual bleeding for twelve years.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">She had endured a great deal under the care of various doctors, yet in spite of spending all she had on their treatments, she was getting worse instead of better.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">When she heard about Jesus&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">healing power</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">, she pushed through the crowd and came up from behind him and touched his prayer shawl.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">For she kept saying to herself, &apos;If I could touch even his clothes, I know I will be healed.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">As soon as her hand touched him, her bleeding immediately stopped! She knew it, for she could feel her body instantly being healed of her disease!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">Jesus knew at once that someone had touched him, for he felt the power that always surged around him</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">had passed through him for someone to be healed. He turned and spoke to the crowd, saying,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">&apos;Who touched my clothes?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">His disciples answered, &apos;What do you mean, who touched you? Look at this huge crowd&apos;they&apos;re all pressing up against you.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">But Jesus&apos; eyes swept across the crowd, looking for the one who had touched him for healing.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">When the woman who experienced this miracle</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">realized what had happened to her, she came before him, trembling with fear, and threw herself down at his feet,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">saying, &apos;I was the one who touched you.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">And she told him her story of what had just happened.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">Then Jesus said to her,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">&apos;Daughter, because you dared to believe, your faith has healed you. Go with peace in your heart, and be free from your suffering!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">And before he had finished speaking, people arrived from Jairus&apos; house</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">and pushed through the crowd</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">to give Jairus the news: &apos;There&apos;s no need to trouble the master any longer&apos;your daughter has died.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">But Jesus refused to listen to what they were told</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">and said to the Jewish official,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">&apos;Don&apos;t yield to fear. All you need to do is to keep on believing.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">So they left for his home</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">, but Jesus didn&apos;t allow anyone to go with them except Peter and the two brothers, Jacob and John.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">When they arrived at the home of the synagogue ruler, they encountered a noisy uproar among the people, for they were all weeping and wailing.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">Upon entering the home, Jesus said to them,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">&apos;Why all this grief and weeping? Don&apos;t you know the girl is not dead but merely asleep?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">Then everyone began to ridicule and make fun of him. But he threw</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">them all outside. Then he took the child&apos;s father and mother and his three disciples and went into the room where the girl was lying.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">He tenderly clasped the child&apos;s hand in his and said to her in Aramaic,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">&apos;Talitha koum,&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">which means, &apos;Little girl,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">wake up from the sleep of death.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">Instantly the twelve-year-old girl sat up, stood to her feet, and started walking around the room! Everyone was overcome with astonishment in seeing this miracle!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43">Jesus had them bring her something to eat. And he cautioned them repeatedly that they were to tell no one about what had happened.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="6">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Afterward, Jesus left Capernaum</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">and returned with his disciples to Nazareth, his hometown.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">On the Sabbath, he went to teach in the synagogue. Everyone who heard his teaching was overwhelmed with astonishment. They said among themselves, &apos;What incredible wisdom has been given to him! Where did he receive such profound insights?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">And what mighty miracles flow through his hands!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Isn&apos;t this Mary&apos;s son, the carpenter,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">the brother of Jacob, Joseph,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Judah, and Simon? And don&apos;t his sisters all live here in Nazareth?&apos; And they took offense at him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Jesus said to them,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">&apos;A prophet is treated with honor everywhere except in his own hometown, among his relatives, and in his own house.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">He was unable to do any great miracle in Nazareth,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">except to heal a few sick people by laying his hands upon them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">He was amazed at the depth of their unbelief! Then Jesus went out into the different villages and taught the people.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Jesus gathered his twelve disciples and imparted to them his authority to cast out demons. Then he sent them out in pairs with these instructions:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">And whatever house you enter, stay there until you leave the area.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Whatever community does not welcome you or receive your message, leave it behind. And as you go, shake the dust off your feet as a testimony against them.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">So they went out and preached publicly that everyone should repent.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">They cast out many demons and anointed many sick people with oil and healed them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">King Herod soon heard about Jesus, for the name of Jesus was on everyone&apos;s lips. Some were even saying about him, &apos;John the Baptizer has been raised from the dead, and that&apos;s why miraculous powers flow from him!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Others said, &apos;No, he&apos;s Elijah!&apos; While others said, &apos;He&apos;s a prophet, like one of the prophets of old!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">When Herod heard what the people were saying, he concluded, &apos;I beheaded John, and now he&apos;s raised from the dead!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">This infuriated Herodias, and she held a bitter grudge against him and wanted John executed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">But Herod both feared and stood in awe</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">of John and kept him safely in custody, because he was convinced that he was a righteous and holy man. Every time Herod heard John speak, it disturbed his soul, but he was drawn to him and was intrigued by his words.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">But Herodias found her opportunity to have John killed&apos;it was on the king&apos;s birthday! Herod prepared a great banquet and invited all his officials, military commanders, and the leaders of the province of Galilee to celebrate with him on his birthday.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">On the day of the feast, his stepdaughter, the daughter of Herodias,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">came to honor the king with a beautiful dance, and she flattered him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Her dancing greatly pleased the king and his guests, so he said to the girl, &apos;You can ask me for anything you want and I will give it to you!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">And he repeated it in front of everyone, with a vow to complete his promise to her: &apos;Anything you desire and it will be yours! I&apos;ll even share my kingdom with you!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">She immediately left the room and said to her mother, &apos;What should I ask for?&apos; Her mother answered, &apos;The head of John the Baptizer on a platter!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">So she hurried back to the king and made her request: &apos;I want you to bring me the head of John the Baptizer on a platter&apos;and I want it right now!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">Deeply grieved, the king regretted</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">his promise to her, but since he had made his vow in front of all his honored guests, he couldn&apos;t deny her request.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">So without delay the king ordered an executioner to bring John&apos;s head, and he went and beheaded John in prison.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">He brought his head on a platter and gave it to the girl, and the girl brought it to her mother.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">When John&apos;s followers heard what had happened, they came and removed his body and laid it in a tomb.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">The apostles</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">returned from their mission</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">and gathered around Jesus and told him everything they had done and taught.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">There was such a swirl of activity around Jesus, with so many people coming and going, that they were unable to even eat a meal. So Jesus said to his disciples,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">&apos;Come, let&apos;s take a break and find a secluded place where you can rest a while.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">They slipped away and left by sailboat for a deserted spot.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">But many of the people saw them leaving and realized where they were headed, so they took off running along the shore. Then people from the surrounding towns joined them in the chase, and a large crowd got there ahead of them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">By the time Jesus came ashore, a massive crowd was waiting. At the sight of them, his heart was filled with compassion,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">because they seemed like wandering sheep who had no shepherd.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">So he taught them many</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">wonderful</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">things.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">Late that afternoon, his disciples said, &apos;It&apos;s getting really late and we&apos;re here in this remote place with nothing to eat.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">You should send the crowds away so they can go into the surrounding villages and buy food.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">But he answered them,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">&apos;You give them something to eat.&apos; &apos;Are you sure?&apos; they replied. &apos;You really want us to go buy them supper? It would cost a small fortune to feed all these thousands of hungry people.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">&apos;How many loaves of bread do you have?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">he asked.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">&apos;Go and see.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">After they had looked around, they came back and said, &apos;Five&apos;plus a couple of fish.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">Then he instructed them to organize the crowd and have them sit down in groups on the grass.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">So they had them sit down in groups</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">of hundreds and fifties.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">Then Jesus took the five loaves and two fish, gazed into heaven, and gave thanks to God. He broke the bread and the two fish and distributed them to his disciples to serve the people&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">and the food was multiplied in front of their eyes</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">Everyone had plenty to eat and was fully satisfied.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43">Then the twelve disciples picked up what remained, and each of them ended up with a basket full of leftovers!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44">Altogether, five thousand families</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44">were fed that day!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45">After everyone had their meal, Jesus instructed his disciples to get back into the boat and go on ahead of him and sail to the other side to Bethsaida.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46">So he dispersed the crowd, said good-bye to his disciples, then slipped away to pray on the mountain.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="47">As night fell, the boat was in the middle of the lake and Jesus was alone on land.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="48">The wind was against the disciples and he could see</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="48">that they were straining at the oars, trying to make headway. When it was almost morning, Jesus came to them, walking on the surface of the water, and he started to pass by them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="51">Then he came closer and climbed into the boat with them, and immediately the stormy wind became still. They were completely and utterly overwhelmed with astonishment.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="52">Their doubting hearts</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="52">had not grasped his authority and power over all things in spite of just having witnessed the miraculous</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="52">feeding</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="52">.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="53">They made landfall at Gennesaret and anchored there.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="54">The moment they got out of the boat, everyone recognized that it was Jesus,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="54">the healer</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="54">!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="55">So they ran throughout the region, telling the people, &apos;Bring all the sick&apos;even those too sick to walk and bring them on mats!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="56">Wherever he went, in the countryside, villages, or towns, they placed the sick on mats in the streets or in public places</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="56">and begged him, saying, &apos;Just let us touch the tassel of your prayer shawl!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="56">And all who touched him were instantly healed!</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="7">
			<VERS vnumber="1">One day, the Pharisees and certain religious scholars came from Jerusalem and gathered around Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">They were shocked</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">to find that some of Jesus&apos; disciples ate bread without first observing the Jewish ritual of hand washing before eating their meal.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">(For the Pharisees, like all other Jews, will not eat without first performing a ritual of pouring water over their cupped hands</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">to keep the tradition of the elders.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Similarly, when returning from the marketplace, they ceremonially wash themselves before eating.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">They also observed many other traditions, such as ceremonially washing cups, pitchers, and kettles.)</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">So the Pharisees and religious scholars asked Jesus, &apos;Why don&apos;t your disciples live according to the age-old traditions passed down by our elders? They should first ceremonially wash their hands before eating.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Jesus replied,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">&apos;You are hypocrites! How accurately</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">did Isaiah prophesy about you phonies when he said: &apos;These people honor me with their words while their hearts run far away from me!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Their worship is nothing more than a charade! For they continue to insist that their man-made traditions are equal to the instructions of God.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">&apos;You abandon God&apos;s commandments just to keep men&apos;s rituals, such as ceremonially washing utensils, cups, and other things.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Then he added,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">&apos;How skillful you&apos;ve become in rejecting God&apos;s law in order to maintain your man-made set of rules.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">For example, Moses taught us: &apos;Honor your father and mother,&apos; and, &apos;Whoever insults or mistreats his father or mother must be put to death.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">&apos;But your made-up rules allow a person to say to his parents, &apos;I&apos;ve decided to take the support you were counting on from me and make it my holy offering to God, and that will be your blessing instead.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">How convenient! The rules you teach exempt him from providing for his aged parents.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Do you really think God will honor your traditions passed down to others, making up rules that nullify God&apos;s Word? And you&apos;re doing many other similar things.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Then Jesus called the crowd together again, saying,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">&apos;Hear my words, all of you, and take them to heart.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">What truly contaminates a person is not what he puts into his body, but what comes out. That&apos;s what makes a person defiled.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">When Jesus went back home and away from the crowd, his disciples</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">acknowledged that they didn&apos;t understand the meaning of the parable and</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">asked him to explain it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">He answered them,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">&apos;Are you as dull as the rest? Don&apos;t you understand that you are not defiled by what you eat?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">For the food you swallow doesn&apos;t enter your heart, but goes into your stomach, only to pass out into the sewer.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">(This means all foods are clean.)</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">He added,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">&apos;Words and deeds pollute a person, not food.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Evil originates from inside a person. Coming out of a human heart are evil schemes,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">sexual immorality,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">theft, murder,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">adultery, greed, wickedness, treachery, debauchery,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">jealousy,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">slander,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">arrogance,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">and recklessness.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">All these corrupt things emerge from within and constantly defile a person.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">Jesus set out from there to go into the non-Jewish region of Tyre.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">He intended to slip into a house unnoticed, but people found out that he was there.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">But when a woman whose daughter had a demon spirit heard he was there, she came and threw herself down at his feet.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">She was not Jewish, but a foreigner,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">born in the part of Syria known as Phoenicia.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">She begged him repeatedly to cast the demon out of her daughter.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">Finally he said to her,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">&apos;First let my children be fed and satisfied, for it isn&apos;t fair to take the children&apos;s bread</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">and throw it to the little dogs.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">She answered, &apos;How true that is, Lord. But even puppies under the family table are allowed to eat the little children&apos;s crumbs.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">Then Jesus said to her,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">&apos;That&apos;s a good reply! Now, because you said this, you may go. The demon has permanently left your daughter.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">And when she returned home, she found her daughter resting quietly on the couch, completely set free from the demon!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">After this, Jesus left the coastland of Tyre and came through Sidon on his way to Lake Galilee and over into regions of Syria.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">Some people brought to him a deaf man with a severe speech impediment. They pleaded with Jesus to place his hands on him and heal him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">So Jesus led him away from the crowd to a private spot. Then he stuck his fingers into the man&apos;s ears and placed some of his saliva on the man&apos;s tongue.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">Then he gazed into heaven,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">sighed deeply, and spoke to the man&apos;s ears and tongue,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">&apos;Ethpathakh,&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">which is Aramaic</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">for &apos;Open up, now!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">At once the man&apos;s ears opened and he could hear perfectly, and his tongue was untied and he began to speak normally.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">Jesus ordered everyone to keep this miracle a secret, but the more he told them not to, the more the news spread!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">The people were absolutely beside themselves and astonished beyond measure.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">And they began to declare, &apos;Everything he does is wonderful!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">He even makes the deaf hear and the mute speak!&apos;</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="8">
			<VERS vnumber="1">During those days, another massive crowd gathered to hear Jesus, and again, there was no food and the people were hungry. So Jesus called his disciples to come near him and said to them,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">&apos;My heart goes out to this crowd, for they&apos;ve already been here with me for three days with nothing to eat.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">I&apos;m concerned that if I send them home hungry, some may faint along the way, for many have come a long, long way just to be with me.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">His disciples replied, &apos;But could anyone possibly get enough food to satisfy a crowd this size out here in this isolated place?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">He asked them,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">&apos;How many loaves of flatbread do you have?&apos; &apos;Seven,&apos; they replied.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Jesus instructed the crowd to sit down on the grass. After he took the seven loaves, he gave thanks to God, broke them, and started handing them to his disciples. They kept distributing the bread until they had served the entire crowd.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">They also had a few small fish, and after giving thanks for these, Jesus had his disciples serve them to the crowd.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Everyone ate until they were satisfied. Then the disciples gathered up the broken pieces and filled seven large baskets</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">with the leftovers.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">About four thousand</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">people ate what had been multiplied! Then he dismissed the crowd.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Afterward, Jesus got into a boat and sailed to the vicinity of Dalmanutha.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">As soon as Jesus landed,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">he was confronted by the Pharisees,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">who argued with Jesus and tested him. They demanded that he give them a miraculous sign from heaven.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">With a deep sigh from his spirit, he said,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">&apos;What drives this generation to clamor for a sign? Listen to the truth: there will absolutely be no sign given to this generation!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Then he turned and left them, got back into the boat, and crossed over to the opposite shore.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Now, the disciples had forgotten to take bread with them, except for one loaf of flatbread.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">And as they were sailing across the lake</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">, Jesus repeatedly warned them,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">&apos;Be on your guard against the yeast</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">inside of the Pharisees and the yeast inside of Herod!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">But the disciples had no clue what Jesus was talking about, so they began to discuss it among themselves, saying, &apos;Is he saying this because we forgot to bring bread?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Knowing what they were thinking, Jesus said to them,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">&apos;Why all this fussing over forgetting to bring bread? Do you still not see or understand what I say to you? Are your hearts still hard?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">You have good eyes, yet you still don&apos;t see, and you have good ears, yet you still don&apos;t hear, neither do you remember.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">When I multiplied the bread to feed more than five thousand people, how many baskets full of leftovers did you gather afterward?&apos; &apos;Twelve,&apos; they replied.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">&apos;And when I multiplied food to feed over four thousand, how many large baskets full of leftovers did you gather afterwards?&apos; &apos;Seven,&apos; they replied.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">&apos;Then how is it that you still don&apos;t get it?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">When they arrived at Bethsaida, some people brought a blind man to Jesus, begging him to touch him and heal him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">So Jesus led him, as his sighted guide, outside the village. He placed his saliva on the man&apos;s eyes</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">and covered them with his hands.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">Then he asked him,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">&apos;Now do you see anything?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">&apos;Yes,&apos; he said. &apos;My sight is coming back! I&apos;m beginning to see people, but they look like trees&apos;walking trees.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">Jesus put his hands over the man&apos;s eyes a second time and</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">made him look up</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">. The man opened his eyes wide and he could see everything perfectly. His eyesight was completely restored!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">Then Jesus sent him home with these instructions:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">&apos;Go home, but don&apos;t tell anyone what happened, not even the people of your own village.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">Then Jesus and his disciples walked</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">to the villages near Caesarea Philippi.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">On the way, he posed this question to his disciples:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">&apos;Who do the people say that I am?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">They replied, &apos;Some say John the Baptizer, others say Elijah</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">the prophet, and still others say you must be one of the prophets.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">He asked them,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">&apos;But who do you say that I am?&apos; Peter spoke up, saying, &apos;You are the Messiah, the Son of the Living God!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">Then he warned them not to breathe a word of this to anyone.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">From then on, Jesus began to tell his disciples that he, the Son of Man, was destined to go to Jerusalem and suffer great injustice</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">from the elders, leading priests, and religious scholars. He also explained that he would be killed and three days later be raised to life again.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">Jesus opened his heart and spoke freely with his disciples, explaining all these things to them. Then Peter took him aside and rebuked him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">But Jesus turned around, and glancing at all of the other disciples,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">he rebuked Peter, saying,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">&apos;Get out of my sight, Satan!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">For your heart is not set on God&apos;s plan but man&apos;s!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">Jesus had his disciples and the crowd gather around him. And he said to them:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">&apos;If you truly want to follow me, you should at once completely disown your own life. And you must be willing to share my cross and experience it as your own, as you continually surrender to my ways.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">For if you let your life go for my sake and for the sake of the gospel, you will continually experience true life.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">But if you choose to keep your life for yourself, you will forfeit what you try to keep.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">For what use is it to gain all the wealth and power of this world, with everything it could offer you, at the cost of your own life?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">And what could be more valuable to you than your own soul?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">If you are ashamed of me and my words while living among sinful and faithless people, then I, the Son of Man, will also be ashamed of you when I make my appearance with my holy messengers</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">in the glorious splendor of my Father!&apos;</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="9">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Jesus said to them,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">&apos;I tell you the truth, there are some standing here now who won&apos;t experience death until they see God&apos;s kingdom realm manifest with power!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">After six days, Jesus took Peter and the two brothers, Jacob and John, and hiked up a high mountain to be alone. And Jesus&apos; appearance was dramatically altered, for he was transfigured before their very eyes!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">His clothing sparkled and became glistening white&apos;whiter than any bleach in the world could make them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Then suddenly, right in front of them, Moses and Elijah appeared,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">and they spoke with Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Peter blurted out, &apos;Good Teacher,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">this is so amazing to see the three of you together</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">! Why don&apos;t we stay here and set up three shelters:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">(For all of the disciples were in total fear, and Peter didn&apos;t have a clue what to say.)</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Just then, a radiant cloud began to spread over them, enveloping them all. And God&apos;s voice suddenly spoke from the cloud, saying, &apos;This is my beloved Son and you need to always listen to him!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Then suddenly, as they looked around, they saw only Jesus with them, for Moses and Elijah had faded away.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">As they all hiked down the mountain together, Jesus ordered them,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">&apos;Don&apos;t tell anyone of what you just witnessed. Wait until the Son of Man is raised from the dead.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">So they kept it to themselves, puzzled over what Jesus meant about rising from the dead.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Then they asked him, &apos;Why do the religious scholars insist that Elijah must come before the Messiah?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">He answered them,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">&apos;They&apos;re right. Elijah must come first to put everything in order.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">And what about all that is written about the Son of Man? It is true that he must endure many sufferings and be rejected.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">So Elijah has already appeared, just as it was prophesied,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">and they did to him whatever they pleased.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Now when they came down the mountain to the other nine disciples, they noticed a large crowd of people gathered around them, with the religious scholars arguing with them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">The crowd was astonished to see Jesus himself walking toward them, so they immediately ran to welcome him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">&apos;What are you arguing about with the religious scholars?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">he asked them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">A man spoke up out of the crowd. &apos;Teacher,&apos; he said, &apos;I have a son possessed by a demon that makes him mute. I brought him here to you, Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Whenever the demon takes control of him, it knocks him down, and he foams at the mouth and gnashes his teeth, and his body becomes stiff as a board. I brought him to your disciples, hoping they could deliver him, but they were not able to do it.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Jesus said to the crowd,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">&apos;Why are you such a faithless people?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">How much longer must I remain with you and put up with your unbelief? Now, bring the boy to me.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">So they brought him to Jesus. As soon as the demon saw him, it threw the boy into convulsions. He fell to the ground, rolling around and foaming at the mouth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Jesus turned to the father and asked,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">&apos;How long has your son been tormented like this?&apos; &apos;Since childhood,&apos; he replied.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">&apos;It tries over and over to kill him by throwing him into fire or into the water. But please, if you&apos;re able to do something, anything&apos;have compassion on us and help us!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">Jesus said to him,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">&apos;What do you mean &apos;if&apos;?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">If you are able to believe,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">all things are possible to the believer.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">When he heard this, the boy&apos;s father cried out with tears, saying, &apos;I do believe, Lord; help my little faith!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">Now when Jesus saw that the crowd was quickly growing larger, he commanded the demon, saying,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">&apos;Deaf and mute spirit, I command you to come out of him and never enter him again!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">The demon shrieked and threw the boy into terrible seizures and finally came out of him! As the boy lay there, looking like a corpse, everyone thought he was dead.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">But Jesus stooped down, gently took his hand, and raised him up to his feet, and he stood there completely set free!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">Afterwards, when Jesus arrived at the house, his disciples asked him in private, &apos;Why couldn&apos;t we cast out the demon?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">He answered them,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">&apos;This type of powerful spirit can only be cast out by fasting and prayer.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">They went on from there and walked through the region of Galilee. Jesus didn&apos;t want the people to know he was there, because he wanted to teach his disciples in private.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">He said to them,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">&apos;The Son of Man is destined</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">to be betrayed and turned over to those who will execute him. But after three days he will rise again.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">But the disciples didn&apos;t have a clue what he meant and were too embarrassed to ask him to explain it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">Then they came to Capernaum. And as soon as Jesus was inside the house, he asked his disciples,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">&apos;What were you arguing about on the way here?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">No one said a word, because they had been arguing about which one of them was the greatest.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">Jesus sat down, called the twelve disciples to come around him, and said to them,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">&apos;If anyone wants to be first, he must be content to be last and become a servant to all.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">Then he had a child</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">come and stand among them. He wrapped the child in his arms and said to them,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">&apos;Whoever welcomes a little child in my name welcomes me. And whoever welcomes me welcomes not only me, but the one who sent me.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">John spoke up and said, &apos;Teacher, we noticed someone</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">was using your name to cast out demons, so we tried to stop him because he wasn&apos;t one of our group.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">&apos;Don&apos;t stop him!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">Jesus replied.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">&apos;For the one who does miracles in the power of my name proves he is not my enemy.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">And whoever is not against us is for us.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">Listen to the truth that I speak: Whoever gives you a cup of water because you carry the name of Christ will never lose his reward.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">But if anyone abuses</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">one of these little ones who believe in me, it would be better for him to have a heavy boulder</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">tied around his neck and be thrown into the sea</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">than to face the punishment he deserves!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43">&apos;If your hand entices you to sin, let it go limp and useless!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43">For it is better for you to enter into life maimed than to have your entire body thrown into hell,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43">the place of unquenchable fire.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44">This is where the maggots never die and the fire never goes out.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45">And if your foot leads you into sin, cut it off! For it is better to enter life crawling than to have both feet and be flung into hell.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46">This is where the maggots never die and the fire never goes out.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="47">And if your eye causes you to sin, pluck it out! For it is better to enter into life with one eye than to be thrown into hell with two.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="48">This is where the maggots never die and the fire never goes out!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="49">&apos;Everyone will pass through the fire and every sacrifice will be seasoned with salt.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="50">Salt is excellent for seasoning. But if salt becomes tasteless,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="50">how can its flavor ever be restored? Your lives, like salt, are to season and preserve.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="50">So don&apos;t lose your flavor,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="50">and preserve the peace in your union with one another.&apos;</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="10">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Then Jesus left the region</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">and went into the district of Judea,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">across from the Jordan River,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">and again, massive crowds flocked to him, and Jesus, as was his custom, began to teach the people.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">At one point, some of the Pharisees came, seeking to entrap him with a question. &apos;Tell us,&apos; they asked, &apos;is it lawful for a man to divorce</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">his wife?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">He answered them,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">&apos;What did Moses command you?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">They replied, &apos;Moses permitted us to write a certificate of separation that would be valid to complete a divorce.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Jesus said,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">&apos;Yes, Moses wrote this exception</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">for you because you are hardhearted.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">But from the beginning God created male and female.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">For this reason a man will leave his parents and be wedded to his wife.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">And the husband and wife</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">will be joined as one flesh, and after that they no longer exist as two, but one flesh.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">So there you have it. What God has joined together, no one has the right to split apart.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Once indoors, his disciples asked him to explain it to them again.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">So he said to them,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">&apos;Whoever divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery against her.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">And if the wife divorces her husband and marries another, she also commits adultery.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">The parents kept bringing their little children to Jesus so that he would lay his hands on them</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">and bless them</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">But the disciples kept rebuking and scolding the people for doing it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">When Jesus saw what was happening, he became indignant with his disciples and said to them,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">&apos;Let all the little children come to me and never hinder them! Don&apos;t you know that God&apos;s kingdom exists for such as these?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Listen to the truth I speak: Whoever does not open their arms to receive God&apos;s kingdom like a teachable child will never enter it.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Then he embraced each child, and laying his hands on them, he lovingly blessed each one.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">As Jesus started on his way, a man came running up to him. Kneeling down in front of him, he cried out, &apos;Good Teacher, what one thing am I required to do to gain eternal life?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Jesus responded,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">&apos;Why do you call me good? Only God is truly good.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">You already know the commandments: &apos;Do not murder, do not commit adultery, do not steal, do not give a false testimony, do not cheat, and honor your father and mother.&apos; &apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">The man said to Jesus, &apos;Teacher, I have carefully obeyed these laws since my youth.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Jesus fixed his gaze upon the man, with tender love, and said to him,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">&apos;Yet there is still one thing in you lacking.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Go, sell all that you have and give the money to the poor. Then all of your treasure will be in heaven. After you&apos;ve done this, come back and walk with me.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Completely shocked by Jesus&apos; answer, he turned and walked away very sad, for he was extremely rich.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">Jesus looked at the faces of his disciples and said,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">&apos;How hard it is for the wealthy to enter into God&apos;s kingdom realm.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">The disciples were startled when they heard this. But Jesus again said to them,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">&apos;Children, it is next to impossible for those who trust in their riches to find their way into God&apos;s kingdom.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">It is easier to stuff a rope through the eye of a needle</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">than for a wealthy person to enter into God&apos;s kingdom.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">But this left them all the more astonished, and they whispered to one another, &apos;Then who could ever be saved?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">Jesus looked at them and replied,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">&apos;With people it is impossible, but not with God&apos;God makes all things possible!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">Then Peter spoke up and said, &apos;Can&apos;t you see that we&apos;ve left everything we had to cling to you?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">&apos;Listen to my words,&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">Jesus said.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">&apos;Anyone who leaves his home behind and chooses me over children, parents, family, and possessions, all for the sake of the gospel,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">it will come back to him a hundred times as much in this lifetime&apos;homes, family, mothers, brothers, sisters, children, possessions&apos;along with persecutions. And in the age to come, he will inherit eternal life.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">But many who are considered to be the most important now will be the least important then. And many who are viewed as the least important now will be considered the most important then.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">Jesus and his disciples were on the road that went up to Jerusalem, and Jesus was leading them forward. The disciples were filled with wonder and amazement at his bravery, but those following along with them were very afraid. As they approached the city, he took the Twelve aside privately and told them what was going to happen.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">&apos;I want you to know that we are going to Jerusalem, where the Son of Man will be handed over to the ruling priests and religious scholars and they will condemn him to death and hand him over to the Romans.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">And they will mock him, spit in his face, torture him, and kill him, but three days later he will rise again.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">Jacob and John, sons of Zebedee, approached Jesus and said, &apos;Teacher, will you do us a favor?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">&apos;What is it?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">he asked.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">&apos;We want to sit next to you when you come into your glory,&apos; they said, &apos;one at your right hand and the other at your left.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">Jesus replied,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">&apos;You don&apos;t have a clue what you&apos;re asking for! Are you prepared to drink from the cup of suffering</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">that I am about to drink? And are you able to endure the baptism into death</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">that I am about to experience?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">They replied, &apos;Yes, we are able.&apos; Jesus said to them, &apos;You will certainly drink from the cup of my sufferings and be immersed into my death,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">but to have you sit in the position of highest honor is not mine to decide. It is reserved for those especially prepared to have it.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">Now the other ten disciples overheard this, and they became angry and began to criticize Jacob and John.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">Jesus gathered them all together and said to them,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">&apos;Those recognized as rulers of the people and those who are in top leadership positions rule oppressively over their subjects, but this is not the example you are to follow.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43">You are to lead by a different model. If you want to be the greatest, then live as one called to serve others.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44">The path to promotion comes by having the heart of a bond-slave</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44">who serves everyone.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45">For even the Son of Man did not come expecting to be served by everyone, but to serve everyone, and to give his life as the ransom price for the salvation of many.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46">When Jesus and his disciples had passed through Jericho, a large crowd joined them. Upon leaving the village, they met a blind beggar sitting on the side of the road named Timai, the son of Timai.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="47">When he heard that Jesus from Nazareth was passing by, he began to shout &apos;Jesus, son of David,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="47">have mercy on me now in my affliction.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="47">Heal me</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="47">!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="48">Those in the crowd were indignant and scolded him for making so much of a disturbance, but he kept shouting with all his might, &apos;Son of David, have mercy on me now</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="48">and heal me</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="48">!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="49">Jesus stopped and said,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="49">&apos;Call him here.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="49">So they went to the blind man and said, &apos;Have courage! Get up! Jesus is calling for you!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="50">So he threw off his beggars&apos; cloak, jumped up, and made his way to Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="51">Jesus said to him,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="51">&apos;What do you want me to do for you?&apos; The man replied, &apos;My Master, please, let me see again!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="52">Jesus responded,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="52">&apos;Your faith heals you. Go in peace, with your sight restored.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="52">All at once, the man&apos;s eyes opened and he could see again, and he began at once to follow Jesus, walking down the road with him.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="11">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Now, as they were approaching Jerusalem, they arrived at the place of the stables</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">near Bethany on the Mount of Olives. Jesus sent two of his disciples ahead</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">and said to them,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">&apos;As soon as you enter the village ahead, you will find a donkey&apos;s colt tied there that has never been ridden. Untie it and bring it to me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">And if anyone asks, &apos;Why are you taking it?&apos; tell them, &apos;The master needs it and will send it back to you soon.&apos; &apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">So they went and found the colt outside in the street, tied to a gate. When they started to untie it,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">some people standing there said to them, &apos;Why are you untying that colt?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">They answered just as Jesus had told them:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">&apos;The master needs it, and he will send it back to you soon.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">So the bystanders let them go.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">The disciples brought the colt to Jesus and piled their cloaks</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">and prayer shawls</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">on the young donkey, and Jesus rode upon it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Many people carpeted the road in front of him with their cloaks</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">and prayer shawls</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">while others gathered palm branches and spread them before him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Jesus rode</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">in the center</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">of the procession, with crowds going before him and behind him. They all shouted in celebration, &apos;Bring the victory!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">We welcome the one coming with blessings sent from the Lord Yahweh!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Blessings rest on this kingdom he ushers in&apos;the kingdom of our father David! Bring us the victory in the highest realms</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">of heaven</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Jesus rode through the gates of Jerusalem and up to the temple. After looking around at everything, he left for Bethany with the Twelve to spend the night, for it was already late in the day.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">The next day, as he left Bethany, Jesus was feeling hungry.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">He noticed a leafy fig tree in the distance, so he walked over to see if there was any fruit on it, but there was none&apos;only leaves (for it wasn&apos;t yet the season for bearing figs).</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Jesus spoke</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">to the fig tree, saying,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">&apos;No one will ever eat fruit from you again!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">And the disciples overheard him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">When they came into Jerusalem, Jesus went directly into the temple area and overturned all the tables and benches of the merchants who were doing business there. One by one he drove them all out of the temple courts,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">and they scattered away, including the money changers</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">and those selling doves.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">And he would not allow them to use the temple courts as a thoroughfare for carrying their merchandise and their furniture.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Then he began to teach the people, saying,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">&apos;Does not the Scripture say, &apos;My house will be a house of prayer for all the world to share&apos;?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">But you have made it a hangout of thieves!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">When the chief priests and religious scholars heard this, they began to hatch a plot as to how they could eliminate Jesus. But they feared him and his influence, because the entire crowd was totally captivated by his teaching.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">So he and his disciples spent the nights outside the city.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">In the morning, they passed by the fig tree that Jesus spoke to and it was completely withered from the roots up.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Peter remembered and said to him, &apos;Teacher, look! That&apos;s the fig tree you cursed. It&apos;s now all shriveled up and dead.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Jesus replied,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">&apos;Let the faith of God be in you!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">Listen to the truth I speak to you: Whoever says to this mountain with great faith and does not doubt,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">&apos;Mountain, be lifted up and thrown into the midst of the sea,&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">and believes that what he says will happen, it will be done.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">This is the reason I urge you to boldly believe for whatever you ask for in prayer&apos;be convinced that you have received it and it will be yours.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">And whenever you stand praying,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">if you find that you carry something in your heart against another person, release him and forgive him</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">so that your Father in heaven will also release you and forgive you of your faults.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">But if you will not release forgiveness, don&apos;t expect your Father in heaven to release you from your misdeeds.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">They came again into Jerusalem, and while Jesus was walking in the temple courts, the Jewish rulers&apos;the chief priest, certain religious scholars, and the elders&apos;approached him. They came up to him</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">and asked, &apos;What right do you have to say and do these things? Who gave you the authority to do all this?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">Jesus replied,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">&apos;I too have a question to ask you. If you can answer this question, then I will tell you by what power I do all these things.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">Where did John&apos;s authority to immerse come from? Was it from heaven or from people? Answer me now.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">They stepped away and debated among themselves, saying, &apos;How should we answer this? If we say, &apos;from heaven,&apos; he will say to us, &apos;Then why didn&apos;t you respond to John and believe what he said?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">But if we say, &apos;from the people,&apos; we fear the crowds, for they&apos;re convinced that John was God&apos;s prophet.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">So they finally answered, &apos;We don&apos;t know.&apos; &apos;Then neither will I tell you where my power comes from to do these things,&apos; Jesus replied.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="12">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Then Jesus began to speak to them in parables:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">&apos;There once was a man who planted a vineyard</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">and put a secure fence around it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">He dug a pit for its winepress and erected a watch tower. Then he leased it to tenant-farmers and traveled abroad.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">When the time of harvest came, he sent one of his servants</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">to the tenants to collect the landowners&apos; share of the harvest.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">But the tenants seized him and beat him and sent him back empty-handed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">So the owner sent another servant to them. And that one they shamefully humiliated and beat over the head.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">So he sent another servant, and they brutally killed him. Many more servants were sent, and they were all severely beaten or killed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">The owner had only one person left to send&apos;his only son, whom he dearly loved. So he sent him to them, saying, &apos;Surely they will restrain themselves</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">and respect my son.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">But the tenants</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">saw their chance</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">and said to one another, &apos;This is the heir. Come! Let&apos;s kill him, and then we&apos;ll inherit it all!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">So they violently seized him, killed him, and threw his body over the fence!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">So what do you think the owner of the vineyard will do? He will come and put to death those tenants and give his vineyard to others.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Haven&apos;t you read what the psalmist said? The stone the builders examined and rejected has become the cornerstone, the most important stone of all?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">This was the Lord&apos;s plan&apos; and he is wonderful for our eyes to behold!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Now, the chief priests, religious scholars, and leaders realized that Jesus&apos; parable was aimed at them. They had hoped to arrest him then and there, but they feared the reaction of the crowd, so they left him alone and went away.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Then they sent a delegation of Pharisees, together with some staunch supporters of Herod, to entrap Jesus with his own words.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">So they approached him and said, &apos;Teacher, we know that you&apos;re an honest man of integrity and you teach us the truth of God&apos;s ways. We can clearly see that you&apos;re not one who speaks only to win the people&apos;s favor, because you speak the truth without regard to the consequences.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">So tell us, then, what you think. Is it proper for us to pay taxes to Caesar or not?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Jesus saw through their hypocrisy and said to them,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">&apos;Why are you testing me? Show me one of the Roman coins.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">They brought him a silver coin used to pay the tax. &apos;Now, tell me,&apos; Jesus said, &apos;whose head is on this coin and whose inscription is stamped on it?&apos; &apos;Caesar&apos;s,&apos; they replied.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Jesus said,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Precisely. The coin bears the image of the emperor Caesar</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">, so you should pay the emperor his portion.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">But because you bear the image of God,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">you must give to God all that belongs to him.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">And they were utterly stunned by Jesus&apos; words.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Some of the Sadducees, a religious group that denied there was a resurrection of the dead, came to ask Jesus this question:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">&apos;Teacher, the law of Moses teaches</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">that if a man dies before he has children, his brother should marry the widow and raise up children for his brother&apos;s family line.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Now, there was a family with seven brothers. The oldest got married but soon died, and he had no children.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">The second brother married his oldest brother&apos;s widow, and he also died without any children, and the third also.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">This repeated down to the seventh brother, none of whom had children. Finally, the woman died.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">So here&apos;s our dilemma: Which of the seven brothers will be the woman&apos;s husband when she&apos;s resurrected from the dead, since they all were once married to her?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">Jesus answered them,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">&apos;You are mistaken</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">because your hearts are not filled with the revelation of the Scriptures or the power of God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">For when they rise from the dead, men and women will not marry, just like the angels of heaven don&apos;t marry.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">Now, concerning the resurrection, haven&apos;t you read in the Torah</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">what God said to Moses at the burning bush? &apos;I AM the living God, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob&apos;?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">God is not God of the dead, but of the living, and you are all badly mistaken!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">Now a certain religious scholar overheard them debating. When he saw how beautifully Jesus answered all their questions, he posed one of his own, and asked him, &apos;Teacher, which commandment is the greatest of all?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">Jesus answered him,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">&apos;The most important of all the commandments is this: &apos;The Lord Yahweh, our God, is one!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">You are to love the Lord Yahweh, your God, with a passionate heart, from the depths of your soul, with your every thought, and with all your strength. This is the great and supreme commandment.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">And the second is this: &apos;You must love your neighbor</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">in the same way you love yourself.&apos; You will never find a greater commandment than these.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">The religious scholar replied, &apos;Yes, that&apos;s true, Teacher. You spoke beautifully when you said that God is one, and there is no one else besides him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">And there is something more important to God than all the sacrifices and burnt offerings: it&apos;s the commandment to constantly love God with every passion of your heart, with your every thought, and with all your strength&apos;and to love your neighbor in the same way as you love yourself.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">When Jesus noticed how thoughtfully and sincerely the man answered, he said to him,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">&apos;You&apos;re not far from the reality of God&apos;s kingdom.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">After that, no one dared to question him again.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">While Jesus was teaching in the courts of the temple, he posed a question to those listening:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">&apos;Why do the religious scholars say that the Messiah is David&apos;s son?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">Yet it was David, inspired by the Holy Spirit, who sang: Yahweh said to my Lord, &apos;Sit near me in the place of authority until I subdue all your enemies under Your feet.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">Since David calls him Lord, how can he be his son?&apos; The large crowd listened to him with delight.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">Jesus also taught the people,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">&apos;Beware of the religious scholars.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">They love to parade around in their clergy robes and be greeted with respect on the street.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">They crave to be made the leaders of synagogue councils,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">and they push their way to the head table at banquets.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">For appearance&apos;s sake, they will pray long religious prayers at the homes of widows for an offering, cheating them out of their very livelihood.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">Beware of them all, for they will one day be stripped of honor, and the judgment they receive will be severe.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">Then he sat down near the offering box, watching all the people dropping in their coins. Many of the rich would put in very large sums,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">but a destitute widow walked up and dropped in two small copper coins, worth less than a penny.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43">Jesus called his disciples to gather around and then said to them,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43">&apos;I tell you the truth, this poor widow has given a larger offering than any of the wealthy.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44">For the rich only gave out of their surplus, but she sacrificed out of her poverty and gave to God all that she had to live on, which was everything she had.&apos;</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="13">
			<VERS vnumber="1">As Jesus was leaving the temple courts, one of his disciples came to him and said, &apos;Teacher, look at these magnificent buildings! And what tremendous stones were used to build all this!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Jesus turned to them and said,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">&apos;Take a good look at all these enormous buildings, for I&apos;m telling you, there will not be one stone left upon another. It will all be leveled!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Later, while Jesus was sitting on the Mount of Olives, overlooking the temple, his disciples, Peter, Jacob, John, and Andrew, came to him privately where he was sitting and said,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">&apos;Tell us, when will these things happen? And what supernatural sign should we expect to signal your coming and the completion of this age?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Jesus answered,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">&apos;At that time deception will run rampant. So beware that you&apos;re not fooled!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">For many will appear on the scene claiming my authority</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">or saying about themselves, &apos;I am God&apos;s Anointed,&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">and they will lead many astray.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">You will hear rumors of wars nearby, with more rumors of wars to come. Make sure that you are not thrown into a panic or give in to your fears, for these things are destined to happen. Prepare for it,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">but still the end is not yet.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">For nations</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">will go to war against each other and kingdoms will clash with kingdoms. And there will be terrible earthquakes in place after place&apos;seismic events of epic proportion. And there will be famines and riots.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">This is how the first contractions and birth pains of the new age will begin.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">&apos;Be on your guard! For they will hand you over to the ruling councils, and you will be beaten in public gatherings. And you will stand trial before kings and high-ranking governmental leaders as an opportunity to testify to them on my behalf.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">But prior to the end of the age,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">the hope of the gospel</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">must first</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">be preached to all nations.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">&apos;So when they put you under arrest and hand you over for trial, don&apos;t even give one thought about what you will say. Simply speak what the Holy Spirit gives you at that very moment. And realize that it won&apos;t be you speaking but the Holy Spirit speaking through you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Brothers will betray each other unto death&apos;even a father his child. Children will rise up to take a stand against their parents and have them put to death.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Expect to be hated by all because of your allegiance to my name. But determine to be faithful to the end and you will be saved.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">&apos;When you witness what Daniel prophesied, &apos;the disgusting destroyer,&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">standing where it must not be</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">[Let the reader learn what it means],</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">then those in the land of Judah must escape to higher ground.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">On that day, if you happen to be outside,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">don&apos;t go back inside to gather your belongings.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">And if you&apos;re working out in the field, don&apos;t run back home to get a coat.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">It will be especially hard</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">for pregnant women and for those nursing their babies when those days come.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">So pray that your escape will not be during the winter months.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">For this will be a time of great misery beyond the magnitude of anything the world has ever seen from the beginning of time</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">or ever will see.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Unless God limits those days, no one would escape. But because of his love for his chosen ones, he will shorten that time of trouble.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">&apos;And if you hear reports from people, saying, &apos;Look, the Messiah is over here,&apos; or, &apos;The Messiah is over there!&apos; don&apos;t believe it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">For there will be imposters falsely claiming to be God&apos;s &apos;Anointed One.&apos; And false prophets</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">will arise to perform miracle signs, and if it were possible, they would cause God&apos;s chosen ones to wander off the right track.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">Be alert, for I prophesy all this will happen!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">&apos;This is what will take place after that suffering: The sun will be darkened and the moon will reflect no light.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">The stars will be falling from the sky and all the cosmic powers will be shaken.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">&apos;Then they will see the Son of Man appearing in the midst of clouds and revealed with mighty power and great glory.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">At that time he will send his messengers</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">to gather together his beloved chosen ones from every direction&apos;from the ends of the earth to the ends of heaven!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">&apos;Now, learn the lesson from the parable of the fig tree. When spring arrives, and it sends out its tender branches and sprouts leaves, you know that summer is near.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">So also, when you observe all these things progressively taking place, you will know that he</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">is near, even at the door!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">I assure you, this family</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">will not pass away until all I have spoken comes to pass.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">The earth and sky will wear out and fade away before one word I speak loses its power or fails to accomplish its purpose.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">&apos;Concerning that day and exact hour, no one knows when it will arrive, not the angels of heaven, not even the Son&apos;only the Father knows.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">This is why you must be waiting, watching and praying,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">because no one knows when that season of time will come.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">&apos;For those days can be compared to a man who was about to leave on a journey, but before leaving he placed his servants in charge and gave each one work to do while he was away. Then he commanded the watchman</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">to be on guard at all times.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">So I say to you, keep awake and alert&apos;for you have no idea when the master of the house will return; in the evening, at midnight, at four o&apos;clock in the morning,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">or at dawn.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">Be alert, for he&apos;s coming suddenly and may find you sleeping!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">And what I say to the four of you, I say to everyone&apos;be awake at all times!&apos;</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="14">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Two days before the Passover and the Feast of Unleavened Bread,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">the leading priests and religious scholars were committed to finding a way to secretly arrest Jesus and have him executed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">They agreed that their plot could not succeed if they carried it out during the days of the feast, for they said, &apos;There could be a riot among the people.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Now Jesus was in Bethany, in the home of Simon, a man Jesus had healed of leprosy.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">And as he was reclining at the table,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">a woman came into the house, with an alabaster flask</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">filled with the highest quality of fragrant and expensive oil.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">She came to Jesus, and with a gesture of extreme devotion</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">, she broke the flask and poured out the precious oil over his head.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">But some were highly indignant when they saw this, and they complained to one another, saying, &apos;What a total waste!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">It could have been sold for a great sum,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">and the money could have benefited the poor.&apos; So they scolded her harshly.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Jesus said to them,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">&apos;Leave her alone! Why are you so critical of this woman? She has honored me with this beautiful act of kindness.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">You will always have the poor, whom you can help whenever you want, but you will not always have me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">When she poured the fragrant oil over me, she was preparing my body in advance of my burial.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">She has done all that she could to honor me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">I promise you that as this wonderful gospel spreads all over the world, the story of her lavish devotion to me will be mentioned in memory of her.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">One of the twelve apostles, Judas Iscariot,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">went to the leading priests to inform them of his willingness to betray Jesus into their hands.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">They were delighted to hear this and agreed to pay him for it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">So immediately Judas began to look for the right opportunity to betray him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">On the first day of Unleavened Bread, when the Passover Lamb is sacrificed, Jesus&apos; disciples asked him, &apos;Where would you like us to prepare the Passover meal</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">for you?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">So he sent two of his disciples ahead into Jerusalem with these instructions:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">&apos;Make your way into the city and watch for a man carrying a pitcher of water. Follow him,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">and say to the owner of whatever house he enters, &apos;The Teacher wants to ask you: &apos;Do you have my room ready where I can eat the Passover meal with my disciples?&apos; &apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">And he will show you a large upstairs room ready and with a table set. Make preparations for us there.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">So they went into the city and found everything to be exactly like Jesus had prophesied, and they prepared for him the Passover meal.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">And when evening came, he entered the house and went upstairs with his twelve disciples.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Over dinner, while they were reclining around the table, Jesus said,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">&apos;Listen to the truth: One of you eating here with me is about to betray me.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Feeling deeply troubled by these words, one after another asked him, &apos;Is it I?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">He answered,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">&apos;It is one of you twelve who has shared meals with me as an intimate friend.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">All that was prophesied of me, the Son of Man, is destined to soon take place,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">but it will be disastrous for the one who betrays the Son of Man. It would be far better for him if he had never been born!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">As they were dining, Jesus took the bread and blessed it, and broke it,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">and gave it to his disciples. He said to them,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">&apos;Receive this; it is my body.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">Then taking the cup of wine and giving thanks to the Father, he declared the new covenant with them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">And as each one drank from the cup,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">he said to them,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">&apos;This is my blood, which seals the new</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">covenant poured out for many.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">I tell you the truth, I will not drink again of the fruit of the vine until the day comes when we drink it together in the kingdom</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">feast</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">of my Father.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">Then they sang a psalm</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">and afterwards left for the Mount of Olives.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">Jesus said to them,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">&apos;You will all fall away and desert me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">This will fulfill the prophecy of the Scripture that says: I will strike down the shepherd and all the sheep will scatter.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">&apos;But after I am risen,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">I will go ahead of you to Galilee.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">Then Peter spoke up and said, &apos;Even if all the rest lose their faith and fall away, I will still be beside you!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">Jesus said,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">&apos;Mark my words, Peter. This very night, before the rooster crows twice a few hours from now, you will deny that you know me three times.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">But Peter was insistent and replied emphatically, &apos;I will absolutely not! Under no circumstances will I ever deny you&apos;even if I have to die with you!&apos; And all the others repeated the same thing.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">Then Jesus led his disciples to an orchard called &apos;The Oil Press.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">He told them,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">&apos;Sit here while I pray awhile.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">He took Peter, Jacob, and John with him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">An intense feeling of great horror plunged his soul into deep sorrow.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">And he said to them,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">&apos;My heart is overwhelmed with anguish and crushed with grief.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">It feels as though I&apos;m dying. Stay here and keep watch with me.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">He walked a short distance away, and being overcome with grief, he threw himself facedown on the ground. He prayed that if it were possible, he would not have to experience this hour</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">of suffering</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">He prayed,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">&apos;Abba, my Father, all things are possible for you. Please&apos;remove this cup of suffering!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">Yet what I want is not important, for I only desire to fulfill your plan for me.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">Then he came back to his three disciples and found them all sound asleep. He awakened Peter and said to him,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">&apos;Simon, are you asleep? Do you lack the strength to stay awake with me for even just an hour?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">Keep alert and pray that you&apos;ll be spared from this time of testing. For your spirit is eager enough, but your humanity is feeble.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">Then he left them a second time and went to pray the same thing.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">Afterward, he came back to the disciples and found them sound asleep, for they couldn&apos;t keep their eyes open and they didn&apos;t know what to say to him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">After praying for the third time, he returned to his disciples and awoke them again, saying,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">&apos;Do you plan on sleeping and resting indefinitely? That&apos;s enough sleep! The end has come and the hour has arrived</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">for the Son of Man to be handed over to the authority of sinful men.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">Get up and let&apos;s go. Don&apos;t you see? My betrayer draws near.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43">At that moment Judas, one of the Twelve, arrived, along with a large crowd of men armed with swords and clubs. They had been sent to arrest Jesus by order of the ruling priests, the religious scholars, and the Jewish leaders.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44">Now, Judas, the traitor, had arranged to give them a signal that would identify Jesus, for he had told them, &apos;Jesus is the man I will kiss. So arrest him and take him away.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45">Judas quickly stepped up to Jesus and said, &apos;Rabbi, my teacher!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45">and he kissed him on both cheeks.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46">Then the armed men seized Jesus to arrest him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="47">One of the disciples</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="47">pulled out a sword</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="47">and swung it at the servant of</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="47">Caiaphas</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="47">, the high priest, slashing off his ear.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="48">Jesus said to the mob,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="48">&apos;Why would you arrest me with swords and clubs as though I were an outlaw?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="49">Day after day I sat with you in the temple courts, teaching the people, yet you didn&apos;t arrest me then. But all of this fulfills the prophecies of the Scriptures.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="50">At that point all of his disciples ran away and abandoned him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="51">There was a young man</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="51">there following Jesus, wearing only a linen sheet wrapped around him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="52">They tried to arrest him also, but he slipped from their grasp and ran off naked,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="52">leaving his linen cloth in their hands.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="53">Those who arrested Jesus led him away to Caiaphas, the high priest, to a meeting where the religious scholars and Jewish leaders were assembled.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="54">Now, Peter had followed him from a distance all the way to the chief priest&apos;s courtyard. He sat with the guards and was warming himself by the fire.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="55">The chief priests and the Jewish council of leaders were doing their best to find false charges that they could bring against Jesus and condemn him to death, but they could not find any.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="56">Many false witnesses came forward, but the evidence could not be corroborated.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="57">Some came forward and testified against him, saying,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="58">&apos;We heard him say, &apos;I can destroy this temple made with hands and then build another one again in three days not made with hands!&apos; &apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="59">Yet even on this point the witnesses did not agree.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="60">Finally, the chief priest stood up in the middle of them and said to Jesus, &apos;Have you nothing to say about these allegations? Is what they&apos;re saying about you true?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="61">But Jesus remained silent before them and did not answer. So the chief priest said to him, &apos;Are you the anointed Messiah, the Son of the Blessed God?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="62">Jesus answered him,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="62">&apos;I am. And more than that, you are about to see the Son of Man seated at the right hand of the Almighty and coming in the heavenly clouds!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="63">Then,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="63">as an act of outrage</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="63">, the high priest</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="63">tore his robe and shouted, &apos;No more witnesses are needed,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="64">for you&apos;ve heard this grievous blasphemy.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="64">Turning to the council he said</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="64">, &apos;Now, what is your verdict?&apos; &apos;He&apos;s guilty and deserves the death penalty!&apos; they all answered.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="65">Then they spat on his face</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="65">and blindfolded him. Others struck him over and over with their fists and taunted him by saying, &apos;Prophesy to us!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="65">Tell us which one of us is about to hit you next?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="65">&apos; And the guards took him and beat him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="66">Meanwhile, Peter was sitting below in the courtyard when a girl, a servant of the high priest, came near the fire.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="67">When she saw Peter there warming himself, she said to him, &apos;I recognize you. You were with that Nazarene, Jesus.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="68">But Peter denied it, saying, &apos;I don&apos;t have a clue what you&apos;re talking about.&apos; Then he went out to the gateway of the courtyard and the rooster crowed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="69">When the servant girl noticed him, she said to all the bystanders, &apos;I know this man is one of his followers!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="70">Once again, Peter denied it. A short time later, the bystanders said to him, &apos;You must be one of them. You&apos;re a Galilean, like he is, for your accent proves it!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="71">Peter cursed and said, &apos;I tell you, I don&apos;t know this man you&apos;re talking about!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="72">At the same moment Peter spoke those words, the sound of a rooster crowing pierced the night for the second time. And Peter remembered the words Jesus had spoken to him earlier:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="72">&apos;Before the rooster crows twice, you will deny me three times.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="72">With his heart shattered</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="72">, Peter broke down and sobbed with bitter tears.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="15">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Before dawn that morning, the ruling priests, elders, religious scholars, and the entire Jewish council set in motion their plan against Jesus. They bound him in chains, took him away, and handed him over to Pilate.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">As Jesus stood in front of the Roman governor</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Pilate asked him, &apos;So, are you really the king of the Jews?&apos; Jesus answered, &apos;You have just spoken it.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Then the ruling priests, over and over, made bitter accusations against him, but he remained silent.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">So Pilate questioned him again. &apos;Have you nothing to say? Don&apos;t you hear these many allegations they&apos;re making against you?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">But Jesus offered no defense to any of the charges, much to the astonishment of Pilate.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Every year at Passover, it was the custom of the governor to pardon a prisoner and release him to the people&apos;anyone they wanted.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Now, Pilate was holding in custody a notorious criminal named Barabbas,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">one of the assassins</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">who had committed murder in an uprising.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">The crowds gathered in front of Pilate&apos;s judgment bench and asked him to release a prisoner to them, as was his custom.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">So he asked them, &apos;Do you want me to release to you the king of the Jews?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">(Pilate was fully aware that the religious leaders had handed Jesus over to him because of spite and envy.)</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">But the ruling priests stirred up the crowd to incite them to ask for Barabbas instead.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">So Pilate asked them, &apos;What do you want me to do with this one you call the king of the Jews?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">They all shouted back, &apos;Crucify him!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">&apos;Why?&apos; Pilate asked. &apos;What evil thing has he done wrong to deserve that?&apos; But they kept shouting out with a deafening roar, &apos;Crucify him at once!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Because he wanted to please the people, Pilate released Barabbas to them. After he had Jesus severely beaten with a whip made of leather straps</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">and embedded with metal</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">he sentenced him to be crucified.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">The soldiers took Jesus into the headquarters of the governor&apos;s compound</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">and summoned a military unit of nearly six hundred men.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">They placed a purple robe on him</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">to make fun of him</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">. Then they braided a victor&apos;s crown, a wreath made of thorns,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">and set it on his head.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">And with a mock salute they repeatedly cried out, &apos;Hail, your majesty, king of the Jews!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">They spit in his face and hit him repeatedly on his head with a reed staff, driving the crown of thorns deep into his brow. They knelt down before him in mockery, pretending to pay him homage.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">When they finished ridiculing him, they took off the purple robe, put his own clothes back on him, and led him away to be crucified.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">As they came out of the city, they stopped an African man named Simon, a native of Libya.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">He was passing by, just coming in from the countryside with his two sons,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Alexander and Rufus, and the soldiers forced him to carry the heavy crossbeam for Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">They brought Jesus to the execution site called Golgotha, which means &apos;Skull Hill.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">There they offered him a mild painkiller, a drink of wine mixed with gall,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">but he refused to drink it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">They nailed his hands and feet to the cross. The soldiers divided his clothing among themselves by rolling dice</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">to see who would win them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">It was nine o&apos;clock in the morning</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">when they finally crucified him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">Above his head they placed a sign with the inscription of the charge against him, which read, &apos;This is the King of the Jews.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">Two criminals were also crucified with Jesus, one on each side of him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">This fulfilled the Scripture that says: He was considered to be a criminal.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">Those who passed by shook their heads and spitefully ridiculed him, saying, &apos;Aha! You boasted that you could destroy the temple and rebuild it in three days.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">Why don&apos;t you save yourself now? Just come down from the cross!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">Even the ruling priests and the religious scholars joined in the mockery</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">and kept laughing among themselves,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">saying, &apos;He saved others, but he can&apos;t even save himself! Israel&apos;s king, is he?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">Let the &apos;Messiah,&apos; the &apos;king of Israel,&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">pull out the nails and</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">come down from the cross right now. We&apos;ll believe it when we see it!&apos; Even the two criminals who were crucified with Jesus began to taunt him, hurling insults on him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">For three hours, beginning at noon, darkness came over the earth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">About three o&apos;clock, Jesus shouted with a mighty voice in Aramaic,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">&apos;Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">&apos;that is,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">&apos;My God, My God, why have you turned your back on me?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">Some who were standing near the cross</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">misunderstood</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">and said, &apos;Listen! He&apos;s calling for Elijah.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">One bystander ran and got a sponge, soaked it with sour wine, then put it on a stick and held it up for Jesus to drink.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">But the rest said, &apos;Leave him alone! Let&apos;s see if Elijah comes to rescue him.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">Just then Jesus passionately cried out with a loud voice and breathed his last.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">At that moment the veil</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">in the Holy of Holies</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">was torn in two from the top to the bottom.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">When the Roman military officer who was standing right in front of Jesus saw how he died, he said, &apos;There is no doubt this man was the Son of God!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">Evening was fast approaching, and it was a preparation day before a Sabbath.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43">So a prominent Jewish leader named Joseph, from the village of Ramah,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43">courageously went to see Pilate and begged to have custody of the body of Jesus. Joseph was a highly regarded member of the Jewish council and a follower of Jesus</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43">who was eagerly awaiting the kingdom of God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44">Pilate was amazed to hear that Jesus was already dead, so he summoned the Roman officer, who confirmed it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45">After it was confirmed, Pilate consented to give the corpse to Joseph.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46">Joseph purchased a shroud of fine linen and took the body down from the cross. Then he wrapped it in the linen shroud and placed it in a tomb quarried from out of the rock.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46">Then they rolled a large stone over the entrance to seal the tomb.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="47">Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joseph</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="47">were there and saw exactly where they laid the body of Jesus.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="16">
			<VERS vnumber="3">And they had been asking one another, &apos;Who can roll away the heavy stone for us from the entrance of the tomb?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">But when they arrived, they discovered that the very large stone was already rolled away!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">And as they stepped into the tomb, they saw a young man sitting on the right, dressed in a long white robe. The women were startled and amazed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">But the angel</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">said to them, &apos;Don&apos;t be afraid. I know that you&apos;re here looking for Jesus of Nazareth, who was crucified. He isn&apos;t here&apos;he has risen</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">victoriously</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">! Look! See the place where they laid him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Run and tell his disciples, even Peter, that he is risen. He has gone ahead of you into Galilee and you will see him there, just like he told you.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">They staggered out of the tomb, awestruck,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">with their minds swirling. They ran to tell the disciples, but they were so afraid and amazed, they said nothing to anyone.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Early on the first day of the week, after rising from the dead, Jesus appeared to Mary Magdalene, from whom he had cast out seven demons.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">After she had seen Jesus, she ran to tell his disciples, who were all emotionally devastated and weeping.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Excitedly, Mary told them, &apos;He&apos;s alive and I&apos;ve seen him!&apos; But even after hearing this, they didn&apos;t believe her.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">After this, Jesus appeared to two of the disciples, who were on their way to another village,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">appearing in a form they did not recognize.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">They went back</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">to Jerusalem</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">to tell the rest of the disciples, but they didn&apos;t believe it was true.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Then Jesus appeared</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">before the eleven apostles as they were eating a meal. He corrected them for having such hard, unbelieving hearts because they did not believe those who saw him after his resurrection.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">And he said to them,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">&apos;As you go into all the world, preach openly the wonderful news of the gospel to the entire human race!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Whoever believes the good news and is baptized will be saved, and whoever does not believe the good news will be condemned.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">And these miracle signs will accompany those who believe: They will drive out demons in the power of my name. They will speak in tongues.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">They will be supernaturally protected from snakes and from drinking anything poisonous.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">And they will lay hands on the sick and heal them.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">After saying these things, Jesus was lifted up into heaven and sat down</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">at the place of honor</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">at the right hand of God!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">And the apostles went out announcing the good news everywhere, as the Lord himself consistently worked with them, validating the message they preached with miracle-signs that accompanied them!</VERS>

	<BIBLEBOOK bnumber="42" bname="Luke">
		<CHAPTER cnumber="1">
			<VERS vnumber="5">During the reign of King Herod the Great of Judea,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">there was a Jewish priest named Zechariah</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">who served in the temple as part of the priestly order of Abijah.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">His wife, Elizabeth, was also from a family of priests, and was a descendant of Aaron.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">They were both righteous before God, living virtuously and following the commandments of the Lord blamelessly.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">But they were childless since Elizabeth was barren, and now they both were quite old.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">A large crowd of worshipers had gathered to pray outside the temple at the hour when incense was being offered.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">All at once an angel of the Lord appeared to him, standing just to the right of the altar of incense.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Zechariah was startled and overwhelmed with fear.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">But the angel reassured him, saying, &apos;Don&apos;t be afraid,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Zechariah!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">God is showing grace to you</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">. For I have come to tell you that your prayer</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">for a child has been answered. Your wife, Elizabeth, will bear you a son and you are to name him John.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">His birth will bring you much joy and gladness.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Many will rejoice because of him,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">and he will be one of the great ones in the sight of God. He will drink no wine or strong drink,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">but he will be filled with the Holy Spirit even while still in his mother&apos;s womb.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">And he will persuade many in Israel to convert and turn back to the Lord their God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">He will go before the Lord as a forerunner, with the same power and anointing</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">as Elijah the prophet. He will be instrumental in turning the hearts of the fathers in tenderness back to their children and the hearts of the disobedient back to the wisdom of their righteous fathers. And he will prepare a</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">united people</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">who are ready for the Lord&apos;s appearing.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Zechariah asked the angel, &apos;How do you expect me to believe this? I&apos;m an old man and my wife is too old to give me a child.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">What sign can you give me to prove this will happen?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Then the angel said, &apos;I am Gabriel.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">I stand beside God himself. He has sent me to announce to you this good news.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">But now, since you did not believe my words, you will be stricken silent and unable to speak</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">until the day my words have been fulfilled at their appointed time and a child is born to you. That will be your sign!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Meanwhile, the crowds outside kept expecting him to come out. They were amazed over Zechariah&apos;s delay,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">wondering what could have happened inside the sanctuary.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">When he finally did come out, he tried to talk, but he couldn&apos;t speak a word, and they realized from his gestures that he had seen a vision while in the Holy Place.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">He remained mute as he finished his days of priestly ministry in the temple and then went back to his own home.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">Soon afterward his wife, Elizabeth, became pregnant and went into seclusion for the next five months.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">With joy she exclaimed, &apos;See how kind it is of God to gaze upon me</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">and take away the disgrace of my barrenness!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">Gabriel appeared to her and said, &apos;Rejoice, beloved young woman, for the Lord is with you</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">and you are</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">anointed</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">with great favor.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">Mary was deeply troubled over the words of the angel and bewildered over what this may mean for her.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">But the angel reassured her, saying, &apos;Do not yield to your fear, Mary, for the Lord has found delight in you and has chosen to surprise you with a wonderful gift.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">You will become pregnant with a baby boy, and you are to name him Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">He will be supreme</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">and will be known as the Son of the Highest. And the Lord God will enthrone him as King on the throne of his ancestor David.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">He will reign as King of Israel</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">forever, and his reign will have no limit.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">Mary said, &apos;But how could this happen? I am still a virgin!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">Gabriel answered, &apos;The Spirit of Holiness will fall upon you and almighty God will spread his shadow of power over you in a cloud of glory!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">This is why the child born to you will be holy,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">and he will be called the Son of God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">What&apos;s more, your aged aunt,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">Elizabeth, has also become pregnant with a son. The &apos;barren one&apos; is now in her sixth month.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">Not one promise from God is empty of power. Nothing is impossible with God!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">Then Mary responded, saying, &apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">Yes!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">I will be a mother for the Lord!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">As his servant, I accept whatever he has for me. May everything you have told me come to pass.&apos; And the angel left her.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">Afterward, Mary arose and hurried off to the hill country of Judea, to the village where Zechariah and Elizabeth lived.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">Arriving at their home, Mary entered the house and greeted Elizabeth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">At the moment her aunt heard Mary&apos;s voice, the baby</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">within Elizabeth&apos;s womb jumped and kicked. And suddenly, Elizabeth was filled to overflowing with the Holy Spirit!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">With a loud voice she</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">prophesied with power</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">: &apos;Mary! You are a woman given the highest favor and privilege above all others, for your child is destined to bring God great delight.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43">How did I deserve such a remarkable honor to have the mother of my Lord come and visit me?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44">The moment you came in the door and greeted me, my baby danced inside me with joy!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45">Great favor rests upon you, for you have believed every word spoken to you from the Lord.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46">And Mary sang this song: &apos;My soul is ecstatic, overflowing with praises to God!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="47">My spirit bursts with joy over my life-giving God!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="48">For he set his tender gaze upon me, his lowly servant girl. And from here on, everyone will know that I have been favored and blessed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="49">The Mighty One has worked a mighty miracle for me; holy is his name!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="50">Mercy kisses all who fear him, from one generation to the next.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="51">Mighty power flows from him to scatter all those who walk in pride.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="52">Powerful princes he tears from their thrones and he lifts up the lowly to take their place .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="53">Those who hunger for him will always be filled, but the smug and self-satisfied he will send away empty.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="54">Because he can never forget to show mercy, he has helped his chosen servant, Israel,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="55">keeping his promises to Abraham and to his descendants forever.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="56">Before going home, Mary stayed with Elizabeth for about three months.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="57">When Elizabeth&apos;s pregnancy was full term, she gave birth to a son.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="58">All her family, friends, and neighbors heard about it, and they too were overjoyed, for they realized that the Lord had showered his wonderful mercy upon her.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="59">When the baby was eight days old, according to their custom, all the family and friends came together for the circumcision ceremony.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="59">Everyone assumed that the parents would name the baby Zechariah, after his father,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="60">but Elizabeth spoke up and said, &apos;No, his name is John!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="61">&apos;What?&apos; they exclaimed. &apos;No one in your family line has that name!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="62">So they gestured to the baby&apos;s father to ask what to name the child.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="63">He motioned for a writing tablet, and to the amazement of all, he wrote, &apos;His name is John.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="64">Instantly Zechariah could speak again. And his first words were praises to the Lord.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="65">The fear of God fell on the people of their village, and the news of this astounding event traveled throughout the hill country of Judea. Everyone was in awe over it!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="66">All who heard this news were astonished and wondered, &apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="66">Since a miracle brought his birth</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="66">, what on earth will this child become? Clearly, God&apos;s presence is upon this child in a powerful way!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="67">Then Zechariah was filled to overflowing with the Holy Spirit and he prophesied, saying:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="68">&apos;Praise be to the exalted Lord God of Israel, for he has seen us through eyes of grace, and he comes as our Hero-God to set us free!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="69">He appears to us as a mighty Savior, a trumpet of redemption from the house of David, his servant,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="70">just as he promised long ago by the words of his holy prophets.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="71">They prophesied he would come one day and save us from every one of our enemies and from the power of those who hate us.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="72">Now he has shown us the mercy promised to our ancestors, for he has remembered his holy covenant.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="76">And to you I prophesy, my little son, you will be known as the prophet of the Most High. You will be a forerunner, going before the face of Lord Yahweh, to prepare hearts to embrace his ways.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="77">You will preach to his people the revelation of salvation, the cancellation of all our sins, to bring us back to God .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="78">The splendor-light of heaven&apos;s glorious sunrise is about to break upon us in holy visitation, all because the merciful heart of our God is so very tender.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="79">The word from heaven will come to us with dazzling light to shine upon those who live in darkness, near death&apos;s dark shadow. And he will illuminate the path that leads to the way of peace.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="80">Afterward, their son grew up and was strengthened by the Holy Spirit</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="80">and he grew in his love for God. John chose to live in the lonely wilderness until the day of his public appearance to Israel.</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="2">
			<VERS vnumber="3">Everyone had to travel to the hometown of their family to complete the mandatory census.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">That night, in a field</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">near Bethlehem, shepherds were watching over their flocks.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Suddenly, an angel of the Lord appeared in radiant splendor before them, lighting up the field with the blazing glory of God, and the shepherds were terrified!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">But the angel reassured them, saying, &apos;Don&apos;t be afraid, for I have come to bring you good news, the most joyous news the world has ever heard! And it is for everyone everywhere!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">For today in Bethlehem</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">a rescuer was born for you. He is the Lord Yahweh, the Messiah.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">You will recognize him by this miraculous sign: You will find a baby wrapped in strips of cloth and lying in the feeding trough!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Then all at once</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">in the night sky</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">, a vast number of glorious angels appeared, the very armies of heaven! And they all praised God, singing:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">&apos;Glory to God in the highest realms of heaven! For there is peace and a good hope given to the sons of men.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">When the choir of angels disappeared and returned to heaven, the shepherds said to one another, &apos;Let&apos;s go! Let&apos;s hurry and find this Word</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">who is born in Bethlehem and see for ourselves what the Lord has revealed to us.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">So they hurried off and found their way to Mary and Joseph. And there was the baby, lying in a feeding trough.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Upon seeing this miraculous sign, the shepherds recounted what had just happened.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Everyone who heard the shepherds&apos; story was astonished by what they were told.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">But Mary treasured all these things in her heart and often pondered what they meant.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">The shepherds returned to their flock, ecstatic over what had happened. They praised God and glorified him for all they had heard and seen for themselves, just like the angel had said.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">On the day of the baby&apos;s circumcision ceremony, eight days after his birth, his parents gave him the name Jesus, the name prophesied by the angel before he was born.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Forty days after the birth of her son, Mary&apos;s time of purification had completed, so she came to the temple with a sacrifice, according to the law of Moses.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">So Mary and Joseph took baby Jesus to Jerusalem to be dedicated before the Lord.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">For it is stated in the law of the Lord, &apos;Every firstborn male shall be set apart for God&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">and is required to offer a prescribed sacrifice, &apos;either a pair of turtledoves or two young pigeons.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">As they came to the temple to fulfill this requirement, an</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">elderly</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">man was there waiting&apos;a resident of Jerusalem whose name was Simeon. He was a very good man, a lover of God who kept himself pure, and the Spirit of holiness rested upon him. Simeon believed in the imminent appearing of the one called &apos;The Refreshing of Israel.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">For the Holy Spirit had revealed to him</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">that he would not see death before he saw the Messiah, the Anointed One of God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">Keeping his promise</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">, the Holy Spirit led Simeon to be in the temple court at the very moment Jesus&apos; parents entered to fulfill the requirement of the sacrifice.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">Simeon cradled the baby in his arms and praised God and prophesied:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">He will be glory for your people Israel, and the Revelation-Light for all people everywhere!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">Mary and Joseph stood there, awestruck over what was being said about their baby. Simeon then blessed them and prophesied over Mary, saying:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">While Simeon was prophesying over Mary and Joseph and the baby, Anna walked up to them and burst forth with a great chorus of praise to God for the child. From that day forward she told everyone in Jerusalem who was waiting for their redemption that the anticipated Messiah had come!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">When Mary and Joseph had completed everything required of them by the Law of the Lord, they took Jesus and returned to their home</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">in Nazareth in Galilee.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">The child grew more powerful in grace, for he was being filled with wisdom, and the favor of God was upon him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">Every year Jesus&apos; parents went to worship at Jerusalem during the Passover festival.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">When Jesus turned twelve,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">his parents took him to Jerusalem to observe the Passover, as was their custom.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43">A full day after they began their journey home, Joseph and Mary realized that Jesus was missing.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44">They had assumed he was somewhere in their entourage, but he was nowhere to be found. After a frantic search among relatives and friends,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45">Mary and Joseph returned to Jerusalem to search for him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46">After being separated from him for three days, they finally found him in the temple, sitting among the Jewish teachers,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46">listening to them and asking probing questions.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="47">All who heard Jesus speak were awestruck at his intelligent understanding of all that was being discussed and at his wise answers to their questions.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="48">His parents were shocked to find him there, and Mary scolded him, saying, &apos;Son, your father and I have searched for you everywhere! We have been worried sick over not finding you. Why would you do this to us?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="49">Jesus said to them,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="49">&apos;Why would you need to search for me? Didn&apos;t you know that it was necessary for me to be here in my Father&apos;s house, consumed with him?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="50">Mary and Joseph didn&apos;t fully understand what Jesus meant.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="51">Jesus went back home with them to Nazareth and was obedient to them. His mother</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="51">treasured Jesus&apos; words deeply in her heart.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="52">As Jesus grew, so did his wisdom and maturity. The favor of men increased upon his life, for he was</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="52">greatly</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="52">loved by God.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="3">
			<VERS vnumber="3">John went preaching and baptizing throughout the Jordan Valley. He persuaded people to turn away from their sins and turn to God</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">for the freedom of forgiveness,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">fulfilling what was written in the book of the prophet Isaiah: &apos;Listen! You will hear a thunderous voice in the lonely wilderness telling you to wake up and get your heart ready for the coming of the Lord Yahweh. Make straight every twisted thing in your lives.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">John kept preaching to the many crowds who came out to be baptized, &apos;You are nothing but the offspring of venomous snakes, full of deception! Who warned you to repent before the coming wrath of God?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Then turn away from your sins, turn to God, and let your changed life be proof. Don&apos;t think for a moment that it&apos;s enough to simply be the favored descendants of Abraham.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">That&apos;s not enough to save you</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">I&apos;m telling you, God could make more sons of Abraham out of stones if he chose to!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">&apos;Even now God&apos;s axe of judgment is poised to chop down your barren tree right down to its roots! And every tree that does not produce good fruit will be leveled and thrown into the fire.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">The crowd kept asking him, &apos;What then are we supposed to do?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">John told them, &apos;Give food to the hungry, clothe the poor, and bless the needy.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Even the despised tax collectors came to John to be baptized, and they asked him, &apos;What are we to do to prove our hearts have changed?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">&apos;Be honest,&apos; he replied. &apos;Don&apos;t demand more taxes than what the law requires.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">&apos;And us?&apos; asked some soldiers.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">&apos;What about us?&apos; John answered them, &apos;Be content with what you earn. Never extort money or terrify others by threats of violence or be guilty of accusing the innocent.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">During those days, everyone was gripped with messianic expectations, believing the Messiah could come at any moment, and many began to wonder if John might be the Christ.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">But John made it clear by telling them, &apos;There is one coming who is mightier than I. He is supreme.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">In fact, I&apos;m not worthy of even being his slave.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">I can only baptize you in this river, but he will baptize you into the Spirit of holiness and into his raging fire.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">He has in his hands a winnowing fork to clean up his threshing floor!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">He will separate the wheat from the chaff. The wheat he will gather into his barn, but he will burn the chaff in a fire that no one can ever put out!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">John used many similar warnings as he preached the good news and prepared</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">the people.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">He even publicly rebuked Antipas, son of Herod, the governor of Galilee, for the many wicked things he had done. He fearlessly reprimanded him for seducing and marrying his sister-in-law, Herodias.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Adding to his many other sins, Herod had John seized and locked up in prison.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="4">
			<VERS vnumber="3">It was then the devil said to him, &apos;If you are really the Son of God, command this stone to turn into a loaf of bread for you.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Jesus replied,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">&apos;I will not!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">For it is written in the Scriptures,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">&apos;Life does not come only from eating bread but from God. Life flows from every revelation from his mouth.&apos; &apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">The devil lifted Jesus high into the sky,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">and in a flash showed him all the kingdoms and regions of the world.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Jesus rebuked him and said,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">&apos;Satan, get behind me!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">For it is written in the Scriptures, &apos;Only One is worthy of adoration; therefore, worship only the Lord your God and love him supremely.&apos; &apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Next, the devil took Jesus to Jerusalem, set him on the highest point of the temple, and tempted him, saying, &apos;If you really are the Son of God, jump down in front of all the people.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Jesus replied,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">&apos;It is also written in the Scriptures, &apos;How dare you provoke the Lord your God!&apos; &apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">That silenced the devil&apos;s harassment for the time being. So he retreated until an opportune time.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Then Jesus, armed with the Holy Spirit&apos;s power, returned to Galilee, and his fame spread throughout the region.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">He taught in the synagogues</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">and they glorified him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">After he read this he rolled up the scroll, handed it back to the attendant, and sat down. Everyone stared at Jesus, wondering what he was about to say.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Then he added,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">&apos;Today, these Scriptures came true in front of you.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Everyone was impressed by how well Jesus spoke, in awe of the beautiful words of grace that came from his lips. But they said among themselves, &apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Who does he think he is?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Isn&apos;t he Joseph&apos;s son,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">who grew up here in Nazareth</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">Jesus said to them,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">&apos;I suppose you&apos;ll quote me the proverb, &apos;Doctor, go and heal yourself before you try to heal others.&apos; And you&apos;ll say, &apos;Work the miracles here in your hometown that we heard you did in Capernaum.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">But let me tell you, no prophet is welcomed or honored in his own hometown.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">&apos;Isn&apos;t it true that many widows lived in the land of Israel during the days of the prophet Elijah when he locked up the heavens for three and a half years and brought a devastating famine over all the land?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">But he wasn&apos;t sent to any of the widows living in that region. Instead, he was sent to a foreign place, to a widow in Zarephath of Sidon.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">Or have you not considered that the prophet Elisha healed only Naaman,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">the Syrian, rather than one of the many Jewish lepers living in the land?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">When everyone present heard Jesus&apos; words, they erupted with furious rage.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">They mobbed Jesus and threw him out of the city, dragging him to the edge of the cliff on the hill on which the city had been built, ready to hurl him off.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">But he walked right through the crowd, leaving them all stunned.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">Jesus went to Capernaum</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">in Galilee and taught the people on the Sabbath day.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">His teaching stunned and dazed</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">them, for he spoke with penetrating words and great authority.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">In the congregation, there was a demonized man, who screamed out with a loud voice,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">&apos;Go away and leave us alone. We know who you are. You&apos;re Jesus of Nazareth, God&apos;s Holy One. What do you want with us? Have you come to destroy us already?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">Immediately the demon hurled the man down on the floor in front of them. But Jesus rebuked the demon,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">&apos;Be quiet and come out of him!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">And without causing him any harm, the demon came out of him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">Great astonishment swept over the people, and they said among themselves, &apos;What kind of man is this who has such power and authority? With a mere word, he commands demons to come out, and they obey him!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">Reports about Jesus spread like wildfire throughout every community in the surrounding region.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">After leaving the synagogue, Jesus went into Simon&apos;s house, where Simon&apos;s mother-in-law was sick with a high fever. The disciples begged Jesus to help her.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">Jesus stood over her and rebuked the fever,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">and she was healed instantly. Then she got up and began to serve them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">At sunset,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">the people brought all those who were sick to Jesus to be healed. Jesus laid his hands on them one by one, and he healed them all of different illnesses.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">Demons also came out of many of them. Knowing that Jesus was the Anointed One, the demons shouted while coming out, &apos;You are the Messiah, the Son of El Shaddai!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">But Jesus rebuked them and commanded them to be silent.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">At daybreak the next morning, the crowds came and searched everywhere for him, but Jesus had already left to go to a secluded place. When they finally found him, they held him tightly, begging him to stay with them in Capernaum.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43">But Jesus said,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43">&apos;Don&apos;t you know there are other places I must go and offer the hope of God&apos;s kingdom?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43">This is what I have been sent to do.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44">Jesus continued to travel and preach in the synagogues throughout the land.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="5">
			<VERS vnumber="1">On one occasion, Jesus was preaching to a crowd on the shore of Lake Galilee.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">A vast multitude of people was pushing to get close to Jesus to hear the word of God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">He noticed two fishing boats at the water&apos;s edge, with the fishermen nearby, rinsing their nets.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Jesus climbed into the boat belonging to Simon Peter and said to him,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">&apos;Let me use your boat. Push it off a short distance away from the shore so I can speak to the crowd.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Jesus sat down and taught the people from the boat. When he had finished, he said to Peter,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">&apos;Now row out to deep water to cast your nets and you will have a great catch.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">&apos;Master,&apos; Peter replied, &apos;we&apos;ve just come back from fishing all night and didn&apos;t catch a thing. But if you insist, we&apos;ll go out again and let down our nets because of your word.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">When they pulled up their nets, they were shocked to see a huge catch of fish, and their nets were ready to burst!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">They waved to their business partners in the other boat for help. They ended up completely filling both boats with fish until they began to sink!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">When Simon Peter saw this</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">astonishing miracle</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">, he knelt at Jesus&apos; feet and begged him, &apos;Go away from me, Master, for I am a sinful man!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">After pulling their boats to the shore, they left everything behind and followed Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">One day, while Jesus was in a certain city, he came upon a man covered with leprous sores. When the man recognized Jesus, he fell on his face at Jesus&apos; feet and begged to be healed, saying, &apos;If you were willing, you could completely heal me.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">After this miracle, the news about Jesus spread even farther. Massive crowds continually gathered to hear him speak and to be healed from their illnesses.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">But Jesus often slipped away from them and went into the wilderness to pray.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">One day, many Jewish religious leaders known as Pharisees,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">along with many religious scholars, came from every village in Galilee, throughout Judea, and even from Jerusalem to hear Jesus teach. And the power of the Lord God surged through him to instantly heal the sick.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Some men came to Jesus, carrying a paraplegic man on a stretcher. They attempted to bring him in past the crowd to set him down in front of Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">But because there were so many people crowding the door, they had no way to bring him inside. So they crawled onto the roof, dug their way through the roof tiles, and lowered the man, stretcher and all, into the middle of the crowd, right in front of Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Seeing the demonstration of their faith, Jesus said to the paraplegic man,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">&apos;My friend, your sins are forgiven!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">The Jewish religious leaders and the religious scholars</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">whispered objections among themselves. &apos;Who does this man think he is to speak such blasphemy? Only God can forgive sins!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Does he think he is God?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">&apos;To prove to you all that I, the Son of Man,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">have the lawful authority on earth to forgive sins, I say to you now, stand up! Carry your stretcher and go on home, for you are healed.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">In an instant, the man rose right before their eyes. He stood, picked up his stretcher, and went home, giving God the glory with every step he took.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">The people were seized with astonishment and dumbfounded over what they had just witnessed. And they all praised God, remarking over and over, &apos;Incredible! What an unbelievable miracle</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">we&apos;ve seen today!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">Afterward, Jesus went out and looked for a man named Matthew.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">He found him sitting at his tax booth, for he was a tax collector. Jesus said to him,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">&apos;Be my disciple and follow me.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">That very moment, Matthew got up, left everything behind, and followed him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">Jesus overheard their complaining and said,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">&apos;Who goes to the doctor for a cure? Those who are well or those who are sick?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">I have not come to call the &apos;righteous,&apos; but to call those who know they are sinners and bring them to repentance.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">Jesus&apos; critics questioned him. &apos;John the prophet is known for leading his disciples to fast often and pray. As the religious leaders of the land, we do the same. Why do you and your disciples spend most of your time feasting at banquets?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">Jesus replied,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">&apos;Should you make the sons of the bridal chamber fast while celebrating with the Bridegroom?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">But when the Bridegroom is taken away from them, then you will see them fasting.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">And he gave them this illustration:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">&apos;No one rips up a new garment to make patches for an old, worn-out one. If you tear up the new to make a patch for the old, it would not match the old garment.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">And who pours new wine into an old wineskin? If someone did, the old wineskin would burst and the new wine would be lost.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">New wine must always be poured into new wineskins.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">Yet you say, &apos;The old ways are better,&apos; and you refuse to even taste the new wine that I bring.&apos;</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="6">
			<VERS vnumber="1">One Sabbath day, Jesus and his disciples were walking through a field of ripe wheat. His disciples plucked some heads of grain, rubbed the husks off with their hands, and ate them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">This infuriated some of the Jewish religious leaders. They said to Jesus, &apos;Why are you allowing your disciples to harvest grain on the Sabbath? Don&apos;t you know it&apos;s not permissible according to the law?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Jesus replied,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">&apos;Haven&apos;t you read the Scriptures? Haven&apos;t you read what King David did when he was hungry?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">He entered the sanctuary of God, took the bread of God&apos;s presence right off the sacred table, and shared it with his men.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">It was only lawful for the priests to eat the bread of God&apos;s presence.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">You need to know that the Son of Man is no slave to the Sabbath, for I am master over the Sabbath.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Jesus, knowing their every thought, said to the man with the deformed hand,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">&apos;Come and stand here in the middle of the room.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">So he got up and came forward.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Jesus said to all who were there,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">&apos;Let me ask you a question. Which is better: to heal or to do harm on the Sabbath? I have come to save a life, but you have come to find a life to destroy.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">One by one Jesus looked into the eyes of each person in the room. Then he said to the man,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">&apos;Stretch out your arm and open your hand!&apos; With everyone watching intently, he stretched out his arm, and his hand was completely healed!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">The room erupted with bitter rage, and from that moment on, the religious leaders plotted among themselves about how they might harm Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">After leaving the synagogue, Jesus went into the high hills to spend the whole night in prayer to God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">At daybreak, he called together all of his followers and selected twelve from among them, and he appointed them to be his apostles.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Jesus and his apostles came down from the hillside to a level field, where a large number of his disciples waited, along with a massive crowd: people from all over Judea, Jerusalem, and the coastal district of Tyre and Sidon.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">They had all come to listen to the Word so that they could be healed of their diseases</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">and be set free from tormenting demonic powers.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">The entire crowd eagerly tried to come near Jesus, to touch him to receive healing, because a tangible, supernatural power emanated from him and healed all who came close to him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Looking intently at his followers, Jesus began his sermon.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">&apos;How enriched</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">you become when you are a beggar, for you will experience the reality of God&apos;s kingdom.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">&apos;How filled you become when you are consumed with hunger and desire, for you will be completely satisfied. &apos;How content you become when you weep with complete brokenness , for you will laugh with unrestrained joy.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">&apos;How favored you become when you are hated, excommunicated, or slandered, or when your name is spoken of as evil because of your love for me, the Son of Man.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">&apos;I promise you that as you experience these things, you will celebrate and dance with overflowing joy, and the heavenly reward of your faith will be abundant, because you are being treated the same way as your forefathers the prophets.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">&apos;But what sorrows await those of you who are rich in this life only, for you have already received all the comfort you&apos;ll ever get.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">&apos;What sorrows await those of you who are content with yourselves, for hunger and emptiness will come to you. &apos;What sorrows await those of you who laugh now, having received all your joy in this life only, for grief and wailing will come to you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">&apos;What sorrows await those of you who are always honored and lauded by others, for that&apos;s how your forefathers treated every false prophet.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">&apos;But I say to you who hear, love your enemies and do something wonderful</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="39">&apos;What happens when a blind man pretends to guide another blind man? They both stumble into a ditch!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">And how could the apprentice know more than his master, for only after he is fully qualified will he be at that level.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="42">How could you say to your friend, &apos;Here, let me show you where you&apos;re wrong,&apos; when you are guilty of even more than he?

			<VERS vnumber="49">&apos;</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="7">
			<VERS vnumber="1">After Jesus finished giving revelation</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">to the people on the hillside, he went on to Capernaum.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">So they came to Jesus and told him, &apos;The Roman captain is a wonderful man. If anyone deserves a visit from you, it is him. Won&apos;t you please come to his home and heal his servant?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">For he loves the Jewish people, and he even built our meeting hall for us.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">I am an ordinary man. Yet I understand the power of authority,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">and I see that authority operating through you</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">. I have soldiers under me who obey everything I command. I also have authorities over me whom I likewise obey. So Master, just speak the word and healing will flow.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Jesus marveled at this. He turned around and said to the crowd who had followed him,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">&apos;Listen, everyone! Never have I found among the people of God a man like this who believes so strongly in me.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Jesus then spoke the healing word from a distance.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">When the man&apos;s friends returned to the home, they found the servant completely healed and doing fine.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Shortly afterward, Jesus left on a journey to the village of Nain,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">with a massive crowd of people following him, and his disciples.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">As he approached the village, he met a multitude of people in a funeral procession, who were mourning as they carried the body of a young man to the cemetery. The boy was his mother&apos;s only son, and she was a widow.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">When the Lord saw the grieving mother, his heart broke for her.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">With great tenderness he said to her,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">&apos;Please don&apos;t cry.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Then he stepped up to the coffin and touched it. When the pallbearers came to a halt, Jesus spoke</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">directly</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">to the corpse,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">&apos;Young man, I say to you, arise and live!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Immediately, the young man moved, sat up, and spoke to those nearby. Jesus presented the son to his mother, alive!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">A tremendous sense of holy mystery swept over the crowd. They shouted praises to God, saying, &apos;God himself has blessed us by visiting his people! A great prophet has appeared among us!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">The news of Jesus and this miracle raced throughout Judea and the entire surrounding region.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">John&apos;s disciples reported to him</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">in prison</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">about all the wonderful miracles and the works Jesus was doing.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">So John dispatched two of his disciples to go and inquire of Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">When they came before the Master, they asked him, &apos;Are you the coming Messiah we&apos;ve been expecting, or are we to continue to look for someone else? John the prophet has sent us to you to seek your answer.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Without answering,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Jesus turned to the crowd and healed many of their incurable diseases. His miracle power freed many from their suffering. He restored the gift of sight to the blind, and he drove out demonic spirits from those who were tormented.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Only then did Jesus answer the question posed by John&apos;s disciples.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">&apos;Now go back and tell John what you have just seen and heard here today. The blind are now seeing. The crippled are now walking. Those who were lepers are now cured. Those who were deaf are now hearing. Those who were dead are now brought back to life. The poor and broken</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">are given the hope of salvation.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">And tell John these words: &apos;The blessing of heaven comes upon those who never lose their faith</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">in me, no matter what happens.&apos; &apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">After John&apos;s messengers departed, Jesus spoke about John to the audience crowded around him, saying,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">&apos;What kind of man did you expect to see out in the wilderness? Did you expect to see a man who would be easily influenced and shaken by the shifting opinions of others?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">Who did you go there to see? Did you expect to see a man decked out in the splendid fashion of the day</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">living in the lap of luxury?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">Or did you discover a true prophet out in the lonely wilderness? Yes, John was a legitimate prophet. Even more than that,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">he was the fulfillment of this Scripture: &apos;See, I am sending my prophetic messenger who will go ahead of me to prepare hearts to receive me.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">&apos;Throughout history there was never found a man as great as John. Yet those who now walk in God&apos;s kingdom realm, though they appear to be insignificant, will become even greater than he.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">When the common and disreputable people among the audience heard Jesus say this, they acknowledged that it was the truth, for they had already experienced John&apos;s baptism.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">But the hearts of the Jewish religious leaders and experts of the law had rejected the clear purpose of God by refusing to be baptized by John.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">Jesus continued, saying,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">&apos;How could I describe the people of this generation? Can&apos;t you see?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">You&apos;re like children playing games on the playground, complaining to friends, &apos;You don&apos;t like it when we want to play Wedding. And you don&apos;t like it when we want to play Funeral. Why will you neither dance nor mourn?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">&apos;When the prophet John came fasting and refused to drink wine, you said, &apos;He&apos;s crazy! There&apos;s a demon in him.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">Yet when the Son of Man came feasting and drinking, you said, &apos;Look at this man! He is nothing but a glutton and a drunkard. He spends all his time with tax collectors and other notorious sinners.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">&apos;Nevertheless, the wisdom of God</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">will be proven true by the expressions of godliness in everyone who follows me.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">Afterward Simeon,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">a Jewish religious leader, asked Jesus to his home for dinner. Jesus accepted the invitation. When he went to Simeon&apos;s home, he took his place at the table.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">In the neighborhood there was an immoral woman of the streets, known to all to be a prostitute. When she heard that Jesus was at Simeon&apos;s house, she took an exquisite flask made from alabaster,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">filled it with the most expensive perfume, went right into the home of the Jewish religious leader, and in front of all the guests, she knelt at the feet of Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">Broken and weeping, she covered his feet with the tears that fell from her face. She kept crying and drying his feet with her long hair. Over and over she kissed Jesus&apos; feet. Then, as an act of worship, she opened her flask and anointed his feet</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">with her costly perfume.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">When Simeon saw what was happening, he thought, &apos;This man can&apos;t be a true prophet. If he were really a prophet, he would know what kind of sinful woman is touching him.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">Jesus said,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">&apos;Simeon, I have a word for you.&apos; &apos;Go ahead, Teacher. I want to hear it,&apos; he answered.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">&apos;It&apos;s a story about two men who were deeply in debt. One owed the bank one hundred thousand dollars,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">and the other only owed ten thousand dollars.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">When it was obvious that neither of them would be able to repay their debts, the kind banker graciously wrote off the debts and forgave them all that they owed. Tell me, Simeon, which of the two debtors would be more thankful? Which one would love the banker most?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43">Simeon answered, &apos;I suppose it would be the one with the greater debt forgiven.&apos; &apos;You&apos;re right,&apos; Jesus agreed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44">Then he spoke to Simeon about the woman still weeping at his feet. &apos;Do you see this woman kneeling here? She is doing for me what you didn&apos;t bother to do. When I entered your home as your guest, you didn&apos;t think about offering me water to wash the dust off my feet. Yet she came into your home and washed my feet with her many tears and then dried my feet with her hair.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45">You didn&apos;t even welcome me into your home with the customary kiss of greeting, but from the moment I came in she has not stopped kissing my feet.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46">You didn&apos;t take the time to anoint my head with fragrant oil, but she anointed my head and feet with the finest perfume.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="47">She has been forgiven of all her many sins. This is why she has shown me such extravagant love. But those who assume they have very little to be forgiven will love me very little.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="48">Then Jesus said to the woman at his feet,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="48">&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="48">All</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="48">your sins are forgiven.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="49">All the dinner guests said among themselves, &apos;Who is the one who can even forgive sins?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="50">Then Jesus said to the woman,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="50">&apos;Your faith in me has given you life. Now you may leave and walk in the ways of peace.&apos;</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="8">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Soon afterward, Jesus began a ministry tour throughout the country, visiting cities and villages to announce the wonderful news</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">of God&apos;s kingdom. His twelve disciples traveled with him</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">as did a number of women who had been healed of many illnesses and set free from demonic power. One of the women was Mary who was from the village of Magdala,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">from whom Jesus had cast out seven demons.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Among the women were Susanna and</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Joanna, the wife of Chusa, who managed King Herod&apos;s household.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Many other women who supported Jesus&apos; ministry from their own personal finances also traveled with him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Massive crowds gathered from many towns to hear Jesus, and he taught them using metaphors and parables,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">such as this:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">&apos;A farmer went out to sow seeds for a harvest. As he scattered his seeds, some of them fell on the hard pathway and were quickly trampled down and unable to grow and became nothing but bird seed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Some fell on the gravel, and though they sprouted they couldn&apos;t take root; it withered for lack of moisture.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Other seeds fell where there was nothing but weeds. They too were unable to grow to full maturity, for the weeds choked them out.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Yet some of the seeds fell into good, fertile soil, and they grew and flourished until they produced more than a hundredfold harvest, a bumper crop.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Then Jesus added, shouting out to all who would hear,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">&apos;Listen with your heart and you will understand!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Later his disciples came to him privately to ask him what deeper meaning they could find in this parable.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">He said,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">&apos;You have been given a teachable heart to perceive the secret, hidden mysteries of God&apos;s kingdom realm. But to those without a listening heart, my words are merely stories. Even though they have eyes, they are blind to the true meaning of what I say,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">and even though they listen, they won&apos;t receive full revelation.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">&apos;Here, then, is the deeper meaning to my parable: The word of God</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">is the seed that is sown into hearts.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">The hard pathway represents the hard hearts of those who hear the word of God but the slanderer</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">quickly snatches away what was sown in their hearts to keep them from believing and experiencing salvation.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">The seeds falling on gravel represents those who initially respond to the word with joy, but soon afterward, when a season of difficulty and harassment of the enemy comes to them, they wither and fall away, for they have no root in the truth and their faith is temporary.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">The seeds that fall into the weeds represents the hearts of those who hear the word of God but their growth is quickly choked off by their own anxious cares, the riches of this world, and the fleeting pleasures of this life. This is why they never become mature and fruitful.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">The seed that fell into good, fertile soil represents those lovers of truth who hear it deep within their hearts. They respond by clinging to the word, keeping it dear as they endure all things in faith. This is the seed that will one day bear much fruit in their lives.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">&apos;No one lights a lamp and then hides it, covering it over or putting it where no one sees its light. No, he places the lamp on a lampstand so others benefit from its brightness.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Because this revelation lamp now shines within you, nothing will be hidden from you&apos;it will all be revealed. Every secret</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">of the kingdom</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">will be unveiled and out in the open, made known by the revelation-light.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">So pay careful attention to your hearts as you listen to my teaching, for to those who have open hearts, even more revelation will be given to them until it overflows. And for those who do not listen with open hearts, what little light they imagine themselves to have will be taken away.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Jesus&apos; mother and his brothers</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">came to where Jesus was teaching, but they couldn&apos;t get through the crowd that had gathered around him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Someone told Jesus, &apos;Your mother and brothers</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">are standing outside, wanting to speak with you.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Jesus told the crowd,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">&apos;These who come to listen to me are like my mother and my brothers. They&apos;re the ones who long to hear God&apos;s words and put them into practice.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">Alarmed, the disciples woke Jesus up and said, &apos;Master, Master, we&apos;re sinking! Don&apos;t you care that we&apos;re going to drown?&apos; With great authority Jesus rebuked the howling wind and surging waves, and instantly they became calm.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">Then Jesus said to them,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">&apos;Why are you fearful? Have you lost your faith</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">in me</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">?&apos; Shocked, they said with amazement to one another, &apos;Who is this man who has authority over winds and waves that they obey him?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">Jesus asked the man,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">&apos;What is your name?&apos; &apos;Mob,&apos; the demons answered. &apos;We are a mob, for there are many of us here in this man.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">We beg you, don&apos;t banish us into the Abyss!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">On the hillside nearby, there was a large herd of pigs, and the demons pleaded with Jesus, &apos;Let us enter into the pigs.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">So Jesus ordered all the &apos;mob&apos; of demons to come out of the man and enter the pigs. The crazed herd of swine stampeded over the cliff into the lake and all of them drowned.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">When the herders tending the pigs saw what had happened, they ran off in fear and reported it to the nearby town and throughout the countryside.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">Then the people of the region came out to see for themselves what had happened. When they came to where Jesus was, they discovered the</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">notorious</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">madman totally set free. He was clothed, speaking intelligently, and sitting at the feet of Jesus. They were shocked!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">Then eyewitnesses to the miracle reported all that they had seen and how Jesus completely delivered the demonized man from his torment. After hearing about such amazing power, the townspeople became frightened.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">Soon all the people of the region of the Gerasenes and the surrounding country pleaded with Jesus to leave them, for they were gripped with fear. So Jesus got into the boat, intending to return to Galilee.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">But the man who had been set free begged Jesus over and over not to leave, saying, &apos;Let me be with you!&apos; Jesus sent him away with these instructions:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">&apos;Return to your home and your family, and tell them all the wonderful things God has done for you.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">So the man went back and preached to everyone who would listen about the amazing miracle Jesus had worked in his life.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">When Jesus returned to Galilee, the crowds were overjoyed, for they had been waiting for him to arrive.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43">In the crowd that day was a woman who had suffered greatly for twelve years</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43">from slow bleeding. Even though she had spent all that she had on healers,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43">she was still suffering.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44">Pressing in through the crowd, she came up behind Jesus and touched the fringe</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44">of his garment. Instantly her bleeding stopped</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44">and she was healed</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44">.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45">Jesus suddenly stopped and said to his disciples,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45">&apos;Someone touched me. Who was it?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45">While they all denied it, Peter pointed out, &apos;Master, everyone is touching you, trying to get close to you. The crowds are so thick we can&apos;t walk through all these people without being jostled.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46">Jesus replied,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46">&apos;Yes, but I felt power surge through me. Someone touched me to be healed, and they received their healing.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="47">When the woman realized she couldn&apos;t hide any longer, she came and fell trembling at Jesus&apos; feet. Before the entire crowd she declared, &apos;I was desperate to touch you, Jesus, for I knew if I could just touch even the fringe of your garment</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="47">I would be healed.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="48">Jesus responded,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="48">&apos;Beloved daughter, your faith in me released your healing. You may go with my peace.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="49">While Jesus was still speaking to the woman, someone came from Jairus&apos; house and told him, &apos;There&apos;s no need to bother the Master any further. Your daughter has passed away. She&apos;s gone.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="50">When Jesus heard this, he turned to Jairus and said,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="50">&apos;Don&apos;t yield to your fear. Have faith in me and she will live again.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="51">When they arrived at the house, Jesus allowed only Peter, John, and Jacob&apos;along with the child&apos;s parents&apos;to go inside.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="52">Jesus told those left outside, who were sobbing and wailing with grief,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="52">&apos;Stop crying. She is not dead; she&apos;s just asleep and must be awakened.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="53">They laughed at him,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="53">knowing for certain that she had died.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="54">Jesus approached the body, took the girl by her hand, and called out with a loud voice,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="54">&apos;My sleeping child, awake! Rise up!&apos;</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="9">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Jesus summoned together his twelve apostles</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">and imparted to them authority over every demon and the power to heal every disease.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Then he commissioned them to proclaim God&apos;s kingdom and to heal the sick to demonstrate that the kingdom had arrived. As he sent them out, he gave them these instructions:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">&apos;Take nothing extra on your journey.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Just go as you are. Don&apos;t carry a staff, a backpack, food, money, not even a change of clothes.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Whatever home welcomes you as a guest, remain there and make it your base of ministry.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">And wherever your ministry is rejected, you are to leave that town and shake the dust off your shoes as a testimony before them.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">The apostles departed and went into the villages with the wonderful news of God&apos;s kingdom, and they healed diseases wherever they went.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Now, Herod, the governor, was confused and perplexed when he heard reports of all the miracles of Jesus and his apostles. Many were saying, &apos;John the Baptizer has come back to life!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Others said, &apos;This has to be Elijah who has reappeared or one of the prophets of old who has risen from the dead.&apos; These were the rumors circulating throughout the land. Herod exclaimed,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">&apos;Who is this Man? I keep hearing about him over and over. It can&apos;t be the prophet John; I had him beheaded!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">So, Herod was very eager to meet Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Months later</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">the apostles returned from their ministry tour and told Jesus all the wonders and miracles they had witnessed. Jesus, wanting to be alone with the Twelve, quietly slipped away with them toward Bethsaida.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Crowds soon found out about it and took off after him. When they caught up with Jesus, he graciously welcomed them all, taught them more about God&apos;s kingdom, and healed all who were sick.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">As the day wore on, the Twelve came to Jesus and told him, &apos;It&apos;s getting late. You should send the crowds to the surrounding villages and farms to get something to eat and find shelter for the night. There&apos;s nothing to eat here in the middle of nowhere.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Jesus responded,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">&apos;You have the food to feed them.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">They replied, &apos;All we have are these five small loaves of bread and two dried fish. Do you really expect us to go buy food for all these people?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">There are nearly five thousand men here,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">with women and children besides</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">!&apos; He told his disciples, &apos;Have them all sit down in groups of fifty each.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">So everyone ate until they were filled, and afterward the disciples gathered up the leftovers&apos;it came to exactly twelve baskets full!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">One time, Jesus was praying in a quiet place with his disciples nearby. He went to them and asked,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">&apos;Who do people think I am?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">They answered, &apos;Some are convinced you&apos;re the prophet John who has returned. Others say you are Elijah, or perhaps one of the Jewish prophets brought back from the dead.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Jesus asked them,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">&apos;But who do you believe that I am?&apos; Peter said, &apos;You are the Anointed One, God&apos;s Messiah!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Jesus gave them strict orders not to tell this to anyone yet, saying,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">&apos;The Son of Man</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">is destined to experience great suffering and face complete rejection by the Jewish leaders and religious hierarchy.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">He will be killed and raised back to life on the third day.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">Jesus said to all of his followers,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">&apos;If you truly desire to be my disciple, you must disown your life completely, embrace my &apos;cross&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">as your own,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">and surrender to my ways.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">For if you choose self-sacrifice, giving up your lives for my glory, you will discover true life. But if you choose to keep your lives for yourselves, you will lose what you try to keep.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">Even if you gained all the wealth and power of this world, and all the things it could offer you, yet lost your soul in the process, what good is that?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">So why then are you ashamed of being my disciple? Are you ashamed of the revelation-truth</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">I give to you? &apos;I, the Son of Man, will one day return in my radiant brightness, with the holy angels and in the splendor and majesty of my Father. On that day I will be ashamed of everyone who has been ashamed of me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">&apos;I promise you this: there are some of you standing here right now who will not die until you have witnessed the presence and the power of God&apos;s kingdom realm.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">Eight days later, Jesus took Peter, Jacob, and John and climbed a high mountain to pray.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">As he prayed,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">his face began to glow until a blinding glory streamed from him. A radiant glory illuminated his entire body.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">His brightness</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">became so intense that it made his clothing blinding white, as multiple flashes of lightning.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">Peter and his companions had become very drowsy, but they became fully awake when they saw the glory and splendor of Jesus standing there and the two men with him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">As Moses and Elijah were about to return to heaven, Peter impetuously blurted, &apos;Master, this is amazing to see the three of you together! Why don&apos;t we stay here and set up three shelters: one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">While Peter was still speaking, a radiant cloud of glory formed above them and overshadowed them. As the glory cloud enveloped them, they were struck with fear.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">Then the voice of God thundered from within the cloud, &apos;This is my Son, my Beloved One.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">Listen carefully to all he has to say.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">When the thunderous voice faded away and the cloud disappeared, Jesus was standing there alone. Peter, Jacob, and John were awestruck. But they didn&apos;t say a word to anyone about what they had seen.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">The next day, a massive crowd was waiting at the foot of the mountain to meet them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">A man in the crowd shouted desperately, &apos;Please, Teacher, I beg of you, do something about my son, my only son.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">An evil spirit possesses him and makes him scream out in torment, and hardly ever leaves him alone. It throws him into convulsions and he foams at the mouth. When it finally does leave him, he&apos;s left with horrible bruises.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">I begged your disciples to drive it out of him, but they didn&apos;t have enough power to do it.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">Jesus responded,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">&apos;You are an unbelieving people with no faith! You twist your lives with lies that have turned you away from doing the right things. How much longer should I remain here, offering you hope?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">Then he said to the man,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">&apos;Bring your son to me.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">As the boy approached, the demon slammed him to the ground and threw him into violent convulsions. Jesus sternly commanded the demon to come out of the boy, and it left immediately. Jesus healed the boy of his injuries and returned him to his father,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">saying</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">&apos;Here is your son.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43">Everyone was awestruck and stunned to see such power and the majesty of God flow through Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44">Everyone marveled, trying to process what they had just witnessed. Jesus then turned to his disciples and said,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44">&apos;Listen carefully and let these words sink into your hearts. The Son of Man is about to be betrayed and surrendered to the authority of men.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45">But the disciples could not grasp the meaning of what he was saying, for it was a veiled mystery to them, and they were too embarrassed to ask him to explain it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46">The disciples began to argue and became preoccupied over who would be the greatest one among them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="47">Fully aware of their innermost thoughts, Jesus called a little child to his side and said to them,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="48">&apos;If you tenderly care for this little child</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="48">on my behalf, you are tenderly caring for me. And if you care for me, you are honoring my Father who sent me. The one who is least important in your eyes is actually the most important one of all.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="49">The disciple John said, &apos;Master, we found someone casting out demons using your name and we tried to stop him, because he doesn&apos;t follow you as we do.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="50">Jesus responded,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="50">&apos;You shouldn&apos;t have hindered him, for anyone who is not against you is your friend.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="51">Jesus let nothing distract him from departing for Jerusalem because the time for him to be lifted up</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="51">drew near, and he was full of passion to complete his mission there.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="52">So he sent messengers</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="52">ahead of him as envoys to a village of the Samaritans.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="53">But as they approached the village, the people turned them away. They would not allow Jesus to enter, for he was on his way</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="53">to worship in Jerusalem</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="53">.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="54">When the disciples Jacob and John realized what was happening, they returned to Jesus and said, &apos;Lord, if you wanted to, you could command fire to fall down from heaven, just as Elijah did</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="54">and destroy all these wicked people.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="55">Jesus rebuked them sharply, saying,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="55">&apos;Don&apos;t you realize what spews from your hearts when you say that? The Son of Man did not come to destroy life, but to bring life to the earth.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="56">So they went to another village instead.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="57">On their way, someone came up to Jesus and said, &apos;I want to follow you wherever you go.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="58">Jesus replied,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="58">&apos;Yes, but remember this: even animals in the field have holes in the ground to sleep in, and birds have their nests, but the Son of Man has no place to lay down his head.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="59">Jesus then turned to another and said,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="59">&apos;Come be my disciple.&apos; He replied, &apos;Someday I will, Lord, but allow me first to fulfill my duty as a good son and wait until my father passes away.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="60">Jesus told him,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="60">&apos;Don&apos;t wait for your father&apos;s burial. Let those who are already dead wait for death. As for you, go and proclaim everywhere that God&apos;s kingdom has arrived.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="61">Still another said to him, &apos;Lord, I want to follow you too. But first let me go home and say good-bye to my entire family.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="62">Jesus responded,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="62">&apos;Why do you keep looking back to your past and have second thoughts about following me? If you turn back you are not fit for God&apos;s kingdom.&apos;</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="10">
			<VERS vnumber="1">After this, the Lord Jesus formed thirty-five teams among the other disciples. Each team was two disciples, seventy in all,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">and he commissioned them to go ahead of him into every town he was about to visit.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">He released them with these instructions: &apos;The harvest is huge. But there are not enough harvesters to bring it in. As you go, plead with the Owner of the Harvest to send out many more workers into his harvest fields.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Now, off you go! I am sending you out even though you feel as vulnerable as lambs going into a pack of wolves.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">You won&apos;t need to take anything</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">with you&apos;trust in God alone. And don&apos;t get distracted from my purpose by anyone you might meet along the way.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">&apos;Once you enter a house, speak to the people there and say, &apos;God&apos;s blessing of peace be upon this house!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">If a lover of peace</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">resides there, your peace will rest upon that household.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">But if you are rejected, your blessing of peace will come back upon you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Don&apos;t shift from one house to another, but stay in one home during your time in that city. Eat and drink whatever they serve you. Receive their hospitality, for you are my harvester, and you deserve to be cared for.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">&apos;When you enter into a new town, and you have been welcomed by its people, follow these rules: Eat</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">what is served you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Heal the sick, and tell them all, &apos;God&apos;s kingdom has arrived and is now within your reach!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">But when you enter a city and they do not receive you, say to them publicly,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">&apos;We wipe from our feet the very dust of your streets as a testimony before you!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Understand this: God&apos;s kingdom came within your reach and yet you have rejected God&apos;s invitation!&apos; &apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Jesus continued,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">&apos;Let me say it clearly: on the day of judgment the wicked people of Sodom will have a lesser degree of judgment than the city that rejects you,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">for Sodom did not have the opportunity that was given to them</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">&apos;How disastrous it will be for the city of Korazin! How horrible for the city of Bethsaida! For if the powerful miracles that I performed in Korazin and Bethsaida had been done</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">in Tyre and Sidon</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">, they would have humbled themselves, repented, and turned from their sins.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Tyre and Sidon</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">will face a lesser degree of judgment than you will on the day of judgment.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">And Capernaum! Do you really think you&apos;ll be highly exalted because of the great things I have done there? No! You&apos;ll be brought down to the depths of hell</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">because of your rejection of me!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Jesus concluded his instructions to the seventy with these words:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">&apos;Remember this: Whoever listens to your message is actually listening to me. And anyone who rejects you is rejecting me, and not only me but the one who sent me.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">When the seventy</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">missionaries</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">returned to Jesus, they were ecstatic with joy, telling him, &apos;Lord, even the demons obeyed us when we commanded them in your name!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Jesus replied,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">While you were ministering</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">, I watched Satan topple until he fell suddenly from heaven like lightning to the ground.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Now you understand that I have imparted to you my authority to trample over his kingdom. You will trample upon every demon before you and overcome every power</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Satan possesses. Absolutely nothing will harm you as you walk in this authority.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">However, your real source of joy isn&apos;t merely that these spirits submit to your authority, but that your names are written in the journals of heaven and that you belong to God&apos;s kingdom. This is the true source of your authority.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Then Jesus, overflowing with the Holy Spirit&apos;s joy, exclaimed,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">&apos;Father, thank you, for you are Lord Supreme over heaven and earth! You have hidden the great revelation of this authority from those who are proud, those wise in their own eyes, and you have shared it with these who humbled themselves. Yes, Father. This is what pleases your heart: to give these things to those who are like trusting children.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">&apos;Father, you have entrusted me with all that you have. No one fully knows the Son except the Father. And no one fully knows the Father except the Son. But the Son is able to reveal the Father to anyone he chooses.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">When Jesus was alone with the Twelve, he said to them,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">&apos;You are privileged to see and hear all these things.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">Many kings and prophets of old longed to see these days of miracles that you&apos;ve been favored to see. They would have given everything to hear the revelation you&apos;ve been favored to hear. Yet they didn&apos;t get to see a glimpse or hear even a whisper.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">Just then a religious scholar stood before Jesus in order to test his doctrines. He posed this question: &apos;Teacher, what requirement must I fulfill if I want to live forever in heaven?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">Jesus replied,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">&apos;What do you read in the Law? How do you understand it?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">The religious scholar answered, &apos;It states, &apos;You must love the Lord God with all your heart, all your passion, all your energy, and your every thought. And you must love your neighbor as yourself.&apos; &apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">Jesus said,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">&apos;That is correct. Now go and do exactly that and you will live.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">Wanting to justify himself, he questioned Jesus further, saying, &apos;What do you mean by &apos;my neighbor&apos;?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">Jesus replied,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">&apos;There was once a</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">Jewish</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">man traveling from Jerusalem to Jericho when bandits robbed him along the way. They beat him severely, stripped him naked, and left him half dead.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">&apos;Soon, a Jewish priest walking down the same road came upon the wounded man. Seeing him from a distance, the priest crossed to the other side of the road and walked right past him, not turning to help him one bit.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">&apos;Later, a religious man, a Levite,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">came walking down the same road and likewise crossed to the other side to pass by the wounded man without stopping to help him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">&apos;Finally, another man, a Samaritan,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">came upon the bleeding man and was moved with tender compassion for him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">He stooped down and gave him first aid, pouring olive oil on his wounds,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">disinfecting them</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">with wine, and bandaging them to stop the bleeding. Lifting him up, he placed him on his own donkey and brought him to an inn. Then he took him from his donkey and carried him to a room for the night.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">The next morning he took his own money from his wallet and gave it to the innkeeper with these words: &apos;Take care of him until I come back from my journey. If it costs more than this, I will repay you when I return.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">So, now, tell me, which one of the three men who saw the wounded man proved to be the true neighbor?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">The religious scholar responded, &apos;The one who demonstrated kindness and mercy.&apos; Jesus said, &apos;Go and do the same as he.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">But Martha became exasperated with finishing the numerous household chores in preparation for her guests, so she interrupted Jesus and said, &apos;Lord, don&apos;t you think it&apos;s unfair that my sister left me to do all the work by myself? You should tell her to get up and help me.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">The Lord answered her,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">&apos;Martha, my beloved Martha. Why are you upset and troubled, pulled away by all these many distractions?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">Mary has discovered the one thing most important by choosing to sit at my feet. She is undistracted, and I won&apos;t take this privilege from her.&apos;</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="11">
			<VERS vnumber="1">One day, as Jesus was in prayer, one of his disciples came over to him as he finished and said, &apos;Would you teach us a</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">model prayer</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">that we can pray, just as John did for his disciples?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">So Jesus taught them this prayer:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">&apos;Our heavenly Father,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">may the glory of your name be the center on which our life turns.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">May your Holy Spirit come upon us and cleanse us.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Manifest your kingdom on earth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">And give us our needed bread for the coming day.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Forgive our sins as we ourselves release forgiveness to those who have wronged us. And rescue us every time we face tribulations.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Then Jesus gave this illustration:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">&apos;Imagine what would happen if you were to go to one of your friends in the middle of the night, pound on his door, and shout, &apos;Please! Do you have some food you can spare?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">A friend just arrived at my house unexpectedly and I have nothing to serve him.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">But your friend says, &apos;Why are you bothering me? The door is locked and my family and I are all in bed. Do you expect me to get up and give you our food?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">I tell you&apos;because of your shameless persistence, even though it&apos;s the middle of the night, your friend will get up out of his bed and give you all that you need.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">&apos;Let me ask you this: Do you know of any father who would give his son a snake on a plate when he asked for a serving of fish?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Of course not!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Do you know of any father who would give his daughter a spider when she had asked for an egg? Of course not!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">If imperfect parents know how to lovingly take care of their children and give them what they need, how much more will the perfect heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit&apos;s fullness when his children ask him.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">One day a crowd gathered around Jesus, and among them was a man who was mute. Jesus drove out of the man the spirit that made him unable to speak. When the demon left him, the mute man&apos;s tongue was loosed and immediately he was able to speak. The stunned crowd saw it all and marveled in amazement over this miracle!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">But there were some in the crowd who protested, saying, &apos;He casts out demons by the power of Satan,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">the demon king.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Others were skeptical and tried to persuade Jesus to perform a spectacular display of power</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">to prove that he was the Messiah</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Jesus, well aware of their every thought, said to them,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">&apos;Every kingdom that is split against itself is doomed to fail and will eventually collapse.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">If it is true that Satan casts out his own demons through me, how could his kingdom remain intact?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">If Satan gives me the power to cast out his demons, who is it that gives your exorcists</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">their power? Let them become your judges! Go, ask them, and they will tell you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">But if I am casting out demons by God&apos;s mighty power,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">God&apos;s kingdom is now released upon you&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">but you still reject it</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">&apos;When a strong man, with many weapons, guards his palace, his possessions are safe.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">But when one stronger than he comes to attack and overpower him, the stronger one will empty the arsenal in which he trusted. The conqueror will ransack his kingdom and distribute all the spoils of victory.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">Whoever is not on my side is against me, and whoever does not gather the spoils with me will be forever scattered.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">&apos;When a demon is cast out of a person, it goes to wander in a waterless realm, searching for rest. But finding no place to rest, it says, &apos;I will go back and reoccupy the body I left.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">When it returns, it finds the person like a house swept clean and made tidy,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">but empty.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">Then it goes and enlists seven demons more evil than itself, and they all enter and possess the person, leaving that one in a much worse state than before.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">While he was saying all this, a woman shouted from the crowd, &apos;God bless the one who gave you birth and nursed you as a child!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">&apos;Yes,&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">said Jesus,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">&apos;but God will bless all who listen to the word of God and carefully obey everything they hear.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">As the crowds continued to swell, Jesus went on to say,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">&apos;How evil is this generation! When you demand a mighty display of power simply to prove who I am,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">you demonstrate your unbelief</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">. The only sign you will see will be a repeat of the miracle of Jonah.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">In the same way Jonah became a sign to the people of Nineveh, so the Son of Man will be a sign to this generation.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">&apos;The Queen of Sheba</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">will rise up on the day of judgment to accuse and condemn this generation</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">for its unbelief</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">. She journeyed from a far and distant land just to listen to the wisdom of King Solomon. One greater than Solomon speaks with you today,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">but you refuse to listen.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">Yes, the people of Nineveh will also rise up on the day of judgment to accuse and condemn this generation.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">For they all repented when they heard the preaching of Jonah, but you refuse to repent. Yet there is one greater than Jonah who is preaching to you today.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">&apos;No one would think of lighting a lamp and then hiding it in the basement where no one would benefit. A lamp belongs on a lampstand, where all who enter may see its light.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">The eyes of your spirit allow revelation-light</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">to enter into your being. When your heart is open the light floods in.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">But when your heart is hard and closed, the light cannot penetrate and darkness takes its place.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">Open your heart and consider my words. Watch out that you do not mistake your opinions for revelation-light!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">If your spirit burns with light, fully illuminated with no trace of darkness, you will be a shining lamp, reflecting rays of truth by the way you live.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">The Lord said,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">&apos;You Pharisees are like those who will wipe clean only the outside of a cup or bowl,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">leaving the inside filthy.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">You are foolish to ignore the greed and wickedness within you! Shouldn&apos;t the one who cleans the outside also clean the inside?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">If you free your heart of greed, show compassion and true generosity to the poor, you will have more than clean hands; you will be clean within.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">&apos;You Pharisees are hypocrites!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">For you are obsessed with peripheral issues</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">, like paying meticulous tithes on the smallest herbs that grow in your gardens.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">Of course, these matters you should do, but when you unjustly cheat others, you ignore the most important duty of all: to walk in the love of God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">Readjust</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">your values and place first things first.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43">&apos;You Pharisees are hypocrites! You love to be honored before others with titles of respect, seeking public recognition,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43">aspiring to seem more important than others.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44">&apos;You Pharisees, what hypocrites! Your true character is hidden, like an unmarked grave that hides the corruption inside, defiling all who come in contact with you.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45">Just then a specialist in interpreting religious law blurted out, &apos;Teacher, don&apos;t you realize that your words insult us?!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46">Jesus responded,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46">&apos;You are also hypocrites, you experts of the law! You crush people beneath the burden of obeying impossible religious regulations, yet you would never even think of doing them yourselves.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="47">What hypocrites! You build monuments to honor the prophets of old, yet it was your murdering ancestors who killed them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="47">The only prophet you&apos;ll honor is a dead one!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="48">In fact, by erecting monuments to the prophets your ancestors killed, you demonstrate your agreement with those murderers and bear witness to their deeds.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="48">You&apos;re no better than they!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="49">That is why God&apos;s wisdom is proclaiming: &apos;I will send to them apostles and prophets though some they will murder and others they will persecute.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="50">&apos;God will hold this generation accountable for every drop of blood of every murdered prophet shed from the beginning of time until now,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="51">from the blood of Abel, who was killed by his brother, to the blood of Zechariah,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="51">who was murdered in the middle of the temple court. Yes, I tell you, you will be responsible for it all.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="52">&apos;You are nothing but hypocrites, you experts of religion! You take away from others the key that opens the door to the house of knowledge. Not only do you lock the door and refuse to enter, but you also do your best to keep others from the truth.&apos;</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="12">
			<VERS vnumber="1">By now a crowd of many thousands had gathered around Jesus. So many people pushed to be near him, they began to trample one another. Jesus turned to his disciples and warned them, &apos;Beware of the hypocrisy of the Pharisees. It permeates everything they do and teach, like leaven.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Everything hidden and covered up will soon be exposed. For the facade is falling down, and nothing will be kept secret for long.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Whatever you have spoken in private will be public knowledge, and what you have whispered secretly behind closed doors will be broadcast far and wide for all to hear.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">&apos;Listen, my beloved friends, don&apos;t fear those who may want to take your life but can do nothing more. It&apos;s true that they may kill your body, but they have no power over your soul.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">The one you must fear is God, for he has both the power to take your life and the authority to cast your soul into hell.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Yes, the only one you need to fear is God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">&apos;I can assure you of this: If you freely declare in public that I am the Son of Man, the Messiah, then I will freely declare to all the angels of God that you are mine.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">But if you publicly pretend that you don&apos;t know me, I will deny you before the angels of God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">If anyone speaks evil of me, the Son of Man, that one can be forgiven. But if anyone speaks scornfully against the Holy Spirit, it will never be forgiven.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">And remember this: When people publicly accuse you</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">and forcefully drag you before the religious leaders and authorities, do not be troubled. Don&apos;t worry about defending yourself or how to answer their accusations.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Simply be confident and allow the Spirit of Wisdom access to your heart, and in that very moment he will reveal what you are to say to them.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Just then someone spoke up from the crowd and said, &apos;Master, you should compel my older brother to divide the family inheritance and give me my fair share!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Jesus answered,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">&apos;My friend, who made me a judge or arbitrator over you?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Speaking to the people, Jesus continued,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">&apos;Be alert and guard your heart from greed and from always wishing for what you don&apos;t have. For your life can never be measured by the amount of things you possess.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Jesus then gave them this illustration:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">&apos;A wealthy land owner had a farm that produced bumper crops. Every year the harvest was so great it filled his barns to overflowing!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">He thought, &apos;What should I do now that every barn is full and I have nowhere else to store more?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">I know what I&apos;ll do! I&apos;ll tear down the barns and build one massive barn to hold all my grain and goods.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Then I can just sit back, surrounded with comfort and ease. I&apos;ll enjoy life with no worries at all.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">&apos;God said to him, &apos;What a fool you are to trust in your riches and not in me! This very night the messengers of death</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">will demand to take your life. Then who will get all the wealth you have stored up for yourself?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">The same thing will happen to all those who fill up their lives with everything but God.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Jesus taught his disciples, saying,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">&apos;Listen to me. Never let anxiety enter your hearts. Never worry about any of your needs, such as food or clothing.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">For your life is infinitely more than just the food you eat or the clothing you wear.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">Take the carefree birds as your example. Do you ever see them worry? They neither grow their own food nor put it in a storehouse for later. Yet God takes care of every one of them, feeding each of them out of</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">the abundance of</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">his love and goodness. Isn&apos;t your life more precious to God than a bird?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">Be carefree in the care of God!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">&apos;Does worry add anything to your life? Can it add one more year, or even one day?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">So if worrying adds nothing, but actually subtracts from your life, why would you worry about God&apos;s care of you?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">&apos;Think about the lilies. They grow and become beautiful, not because they work hard or strive to clothe themselves. Yet not even Solomon, wearing his kingly garments of splendor, could be compared to a field of lilies.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">If God can clothe the fields and meadows with grass and flowers, can he not clothe you as well, O struggling one with so many doubts?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">I repeat: Don&apos;t let worry enter your life. Live above the anxious cares about your personal needs.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">People everywhere seem to worry about making a living, but your heavenly Father knows your every need and will take care of you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">As you passionately seek his kingdom, above all else, he will supply your needs.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">So don&apos;t ever be afraid, dearest friends! Your loving Father joyously gives you his kingdom with all its promises!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">&apos;Now, go and sell what you have and give to those in need; you will be making deposits in your account in heaven, an account that will never be taken from you. Your gifts will become a secure and unfailing treasure, deposited in heaven forever.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">Where you deposit your treasure, that is where you fix your thoughts&apos;and your heart will long to be there also.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">&apos;Be prepared for action</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">at a moment&apos;s notice.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">Be like servants anticipating their master&apos;s return from a wedding celebration. They are ready at a moment&apos;s notice to unlock and open the door for him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">What great joy is ahead for those who stay awake and wait for their Master&apos;s return! He himself will become their servant and wait on them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">He may appear at midnight or even later, but what great joy for the awakened ones whenever he comes!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">Of course, if they knew ahead of time the hour of their master&apos;s appearing, they would be alert, just as they would be ready if they knew ahead of time that a thief was coming to break into their house.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">So keep being alert and ready at all times. For I promise you that the Son of Man will surprise you and appear</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">when you don&apos;t expect him.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">&apos;Lord,&apos; Peter asked, &apos;does this apply only to the twelve of us, or is it for everyone else as well?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">The Lord replied,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">&apos;A master will delegate authority in his house to a trustworthy and thoughtful manager who understands his master&apos;s desires. And the household manager will serve others what they need at exactly the right time.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45">&apos;But what if that servant says in his heart, &apos;My master delays his coming, and who knows when he will return?&apos; Because of the delay, the servant elevates himself and mistreats those in his master&apos;s household. Instead of caring for the ones he was appointed to serve, he abuses the other servants, both men and women. He throws drunken parties for his friends and gives himself over to every pleasure.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46">Let me tell you what will happen to him. His master will suddenly return at a time that shocks him, and he will remove the abusive, selfish servant from his position of trust. The master will punish him and assign him a portion with the unbelievers.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="47">&apos;Every servant who knows what pleases his master yet does not make himself ready and refuses to put his master&apos;s will to action will receive many punishing blows.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="48">Every servant who does not know</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="48">his master&apos;s will</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="48">and unwittingly does what is wrong will receive a less severe punishment. For those who have received a greater revelation from their master are required a greater obedience. And those who have been entrusted with great responsibility will be held more responsible to their master.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="49">&apos;I have come to set the earth on fire, and how I wish it were already ablaze with</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="49">fiery passion for God!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="50">But first I must be immersed into the baptism</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="50">of God&apos;s judgment,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="50">and I am consumed with passion as I await its fulfillment.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="51">Don&apos;t think for a moment that I came to grant peace and harmony to everyone. No, my arrival will change everything and create hostility among you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="52">From now on, even family members will be divided over me and will choose sides</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="52">one against another.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="53">Fathers will be divided from sons and sons from fathers; mothers will be divided from daughters and daughters from mothers; mothers-in-law will be against brides and brides against mothers-in-law&apos;all because of me.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="54">Jesus then said to the crowds gathered around him,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="54">&apos;When you see a cloud forming in the west, don&apos;t you say, &apos;A storm is brewing&apos;? And then it arrives.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="55">And when you feel the south wind blowing, you say, &apos;A heat wave is on the way.&apos; And so it happens.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="56">What hypocrites!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="56">You are such experts at forecasting the weather, but you are totally unwilling to understand</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="56">the spiritual significance of</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="56">the time you&apos;re living in.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="57">&apos;You can&apos;t even judge for yourselves what is good and right.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="58">&apos;When you are guilty of wrong-doing, it is better to agree with your adversary and settle your dispute before you have to go before a judge. If not, your adversary may drag you into court, and the judge may find you guilty and</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="59">throw you into prison until you have paid off your fine entirely.&apos;</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="13">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Some of those in the crowd informed Jesus that Pilate had slaughtered some Galilean Jews</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">while they were offering sacrifices at the temple, mixing their blood with the sacrifices they were offering.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Jesus turned and asked them,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">&apos;Do you believe that the slaughtered Galileans were the worst sinners of all the Galileans?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">No, they weren&apos;t! So listen to me, unless you all repent,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">you will perish as they did.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">What about the eighteen who perished when the tower of Siloam</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">fell upon them? Do you really think that they were more guilty than all of the others in Jerusalem?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">No, they weren&apos;t, and unless you repent, you too will all eternally perish, just as they did.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Then Jesus told them this parable:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">&apos;There was a man who planted a fig tree in his orchard. But every time he came to gather fruit from his tree he found none, for it was barren.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">So he said to his gardener, &apos;For the last three years I&apos;ve come to gather figs from my tree but it remains fruitless. What a waste! Go ahead and cut it down!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">&apos;But the gardener protested, &apos;Sir, we should leave it one more year. Let me fertilize and cultivate it, then let&apos;s see if it will produce fruit.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">If it doesn&apos;t bear figs by next year, we&apos;ll cut it down.&apos; &apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">One Sabbath day, while Jesus was teaching in the synagogue,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">he encountered a seriously handicapped woman. She was crippled and had been doubled over for eighteen years. Her condition was caused by a demonic spirit of bondage</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">that had left her unable to stand up straight.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">The Jewish leader who was in charge of the synagogue was infuriated over Jesus healing on the Sabbath day. &apos;Six days you are to work,&apos; he shouted angrily to the crowd. &apos;On those days you should come here for healing, but not on the seventh day!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">The Lord replied,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">&apos;You hypocrites! Don&apos;t you care for your animals on the Sabbath, untying your ox or donkey from the stall and leading it away to water?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">If you do this for your animals, what&apos;s wrong with allowing this beloved daughter of Abraham,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">who has been bound by Satan for eighteen long years, to be untied and set free on a Sabbath day?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">When they heard this, his critics were completely humiliated. But the crowds shouted with joy over the glorious things Jesus was doing among them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Jesus taught them this parable:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">&apos;How can I describe God&apos;s kingdom?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">God&apos;s kingdom is like the smallest seed that one might plant in a garden. When it grows, it becomes a huge tree, with so many spreading branches that various birds make nests there.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Jesus taught them another parable:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">&apos;How can I describe God&apos;s kingdom?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">God&apos;s kingdom is like something as small as yeast that a woman kneads into a large amount of dough. It works unseen until it permeates</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">the entire batch and the loaf rises high.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Jesus ministered from village to village,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">making his way to Jerusalem and teaching the people as he went.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">A bystander asked him, &apos;Lord, will only a few have eternal life?&apos; Jesus said to the crowd,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">&apos;There is a great cost</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">for anyone to enter through the narrow doorway into God&apos;s kingdom. I tell you, many will want to enter but won&apos;t be able to.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">Once the head of the house has shut and locked the door, it will be too late. Even if you stand outside knocking, begging to enter, and saying, &apos;Lord, Lord, open the door for us,&apos; he will say to you, &apos;I don&apos;t know who you are.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">You are not a part of my family</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">&apos;Then you will reply, &apos;But Lord, we dined with you and walked with you as you taught us.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">And he will reply, &apos;Don&apos;t you understand? I don&apos;t know who you are, for you are not a part of my family. I will not let you in. Now, go away from me! For you are all disloyal to me and do evil.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">&apos;You will experience great weeping and great anguish when you see Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, along with all the prophets of Israel, enjoying God&apos;s kingdom while you yourselves are barred from entering.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">You will see people streaming from the four corners of the earth, accepting the invitation to feast in God&apos;s kingdom realm,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">while you are outside looking in.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">And take note of this: Some are despised and viewed as the least important now, but one day the master will place them at the head of the line. And some whom you view as &apos;elite&apos; today will become the least important then.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">Just then some Jewish religious leaders came to Jesus to urge him to flee from that place because Herod was out to kill him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">Jesus told them,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">&apos;Go and tell that deceiver</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">that I will continue to cast out demons and heal the sick today and tomorrow, and on the third day I will bring my work to perfection.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">For everyone knows I am safe until I come to Jerusalem, for that is where all the prophets have been killed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">O City of Jerusalem, you are the city who murders your prophets! You are the city who pelts to death with stones the very messengers</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">sent to deliver you! So many times I have longed to gather your wayward children together around me, as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings&apos;but you were too stubborn to let me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">Now it is too late, since your house will be left in ruins.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">You will not see me again until you are able to say, &apos;We welcome the one who comes to us sent in the name of the Lord.&apos; &apos;</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="14">
			<VERS vnumber="1">One Sabbath, Jesus was on his way to dine with a prominent Jewish religious leader for a festive meal. Everyone was watching him to see if he would heal anyone on the Sabbath.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Just then, standing right in front of him was a man with his limbs suffering from edema.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Jesus asked the experts of the law and the Pharisees who were present,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">&apos;Does the law permit a man to heal on the Sabbath day? Is it right or wrong?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">No one dared answer, so Jesus turned to the sick man, released healing to him, and sent him on his way.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Jesus said to them all,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">&apos;If one of your children or one of your animals fell into a well, wouldn&apos;t you do all you could to rescue them even on the Sabbath?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">There was nothing they could say&apos;all were silenced.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">When Jesus noticed how the guests for the meal were all vying for the seats of honor, he shared this story with the guests around the table:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">&apos;When you are invited to an important social function, don&apos;t be quick to sit near the head of the table, choosing for yourself a seat of honor. What will happen to you when someone arrives who is more distinguished than you?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">The host will bring him over to where you are sitting and ask for your seat, saying in front of all the guests, &apos;You&apos;re in the wrong place. Please give this person your seat.&apos; Disgraced, you will have to take whatever seat is left.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Instead, when you&apos;re invited to a banquet, you should choose to sit in the lowest place.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">When your host comes and sees you there, he may say, &apos;My friend, come with me and let me seat you in a better place.&apos; Then, in front of all the other guests at the banquet, he will honor you by seating you in the place of highest respect.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">&apos;Remember this: everyone with a lofty opinion of who he is and who seeks to raise himself up will be publicly humbled. And everyone with a modest opinion of who he is and chooses to humble himself will be raised up before all.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Then Jesus turned to his host and said,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">&apos;When you throw a banquet, don&apos;t just invite your friends, relatives, or rich neighbors&apos;for it is likely they will return the favor.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">When they heard this, one of the dinner guests said to Jesus, &apos;Someday God will have a kingdom feast,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">and how happy and privileged will be the ones who get to share in that joy!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Jesus replied with this parable: &apos;A man invited many to join him in a great feast.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">When the day for the feast arrived, the host instructed his servant to notify all the invited guests and tell them, &apos;Come, for everything is now ready for you!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">But one by one they all made excuses. One said, &apos;I can&apos;t come. I just bought some property and I have to go and look it over.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Another said, &apos;Please accept my regrets, for I just purchased five teams of oxen</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">and I need to make sure they can pull the plow.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Another one said, &apos;I can&apos;t come because I just got married.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">&apos;The servant reported back to the host and told him of all their excuses. The master became angry and said to his servant, &apos;Go at once throughout the city and invite anyone you find&apos;the poor, the blind, the disabled, the hurting, and the lonely. Invite them to my banquet.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">&apos;When the servant returned to his master, he said, &apos;Sir, I have done what you asked, but there&apos;s still room for more.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">&apos;So the master told him, &apos;All right. Go out again, and this time bring them all back with you. Persuade the beggars on the streets, the outcasts, even the homeless. Insist that they come in and enjoy the feast so that my house will be full.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">&apos;I say to you all, no one who receives an invitation to feast with me and makes excuses will ever enjoy my banquet.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">As massive crowds followed Jesus, he turned to them and said,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">&apos;When you follow me as my disciple, you must put aside</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">your father, your mother, your wife, your sisters, your brothers; it will even seem as though you hate your own life. This is the price you&apos;ll pay to be considered one of my followers.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">Anyone who comes to me must be willing to share my cross and experience it as his own, or he cannot be considered to be my disciple.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">So don&apos;t follow me without considering what it will cost you. For who would construct a house</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">before first sitting down to estimate the cost to complete it?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">Otherwise he may lay the foundation and not be able to finish. The neighbors will ridicule him, saying,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">&apos;Look at him! He started to build but couldn&apos;t complete it!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">&apos;Have you ever heard of a commander</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">who goes out to war without first sitting down with strategic planning to determine the strength of his army to win the war</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">against a stronger opponent?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">If he knows he doesn&apos;t stand a chance of winning the war, the wise commander will send out delegates to ask for the terms of peace.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">Likewise, unless you surrender all to me, giving up all you possess, you cannot be one of my disciples.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">&apos;Salt is good for seasoning. But if salt were to lose its flavor,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">how could it ever be restored?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">It will never be useful again, not even fit for the soil or the manure pile!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">If you have ears opened by the Spirit, then hear the meaning of what I have said</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">and apply it to yourselves</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">.&apos;</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="15">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Many dishonest tax collectors and other notorious sinners often gathered around to listen as Jesus taught the people.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">This raised concerns among the Jewish religious leaders and experts of the law. Indignant, they grumbled and complained, saying, &apos;Look at how this man associates with all these notorious sinners and welcomes them all to come to him!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">In response, Jesus gave them this illustration:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Returning home, he called all his friends and neighbors together and said, &apos;Let&apos;s have a party! Come and celebrate with me the return of my lost lamb. It wandered away, but I found it and brought it home.&apos; &apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Jesus continued,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">&apos;In the same way, there will be a glorious celebration in heaven over the rescue of one lost sinner who repents, comes back home, and returns to the fold&apos;more so than for all the righteous people who never strayed away.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Jesus gave them another parable:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">&apos;There once was a woman who had ten</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">valuable silver coins. When she lost one of them, she swept her entire house, diligently searching every nook and cranny for that one lost coin.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">When she finally found it, she gathered all her friends and neighbors for a celebration, telling them, &apos;Come and celebrate with me! I had lost my precious silver coin, but now I&apos;ve found it.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">That&apos;s the way God responds</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">every time one lost sinner repents and turns to him. He says to all his angels, &apos;Let&apos;s have a joyous celebration, for the one who was lost, I have found!&apos; &apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Then Jesus said,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">&apos;Once there was a father with two sons.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">The younger son came to his father and said, &apos;Father, don&apos;t you think it&apos;s time to give me my share of your estate?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">So the father went ahead and distributed between the two sons their inheritance.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Shortly afterward, the younger son packed up all his belongings and traveled off to see the world. He journeyed to a far-off land where he soon wasted all he was given in a binge of extravagant and reckless living.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">&apos;With everything spent and nothing left, he grew hungry, because there was a severe famine in that land.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">So he begged a farmer in that country to hire him. The farmer hired him and sent him out to feed the pigs.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">The son was so famished, he was willing even to eat the slop given to the pigs,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">because no one would feed him a thing.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">&apos;Humiliated, the son finally realized what he was doing, and he thought, &apos;There are many workers at my father&apos;s house who have all the food they want with plenty to spare. They lack nothing. Why am I here dying of hunger, feeding these pigs and eating their slop?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">I want to go back home to my father&apos;s house, and I&apos;ll say to him, &apos;Father, I was wrong. I have sinned against you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">I&apos;ll never again be worthy to be called your son. Please, Father, just treat me like one of your employees.&apos; &apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">&apos;So the young son set off for home. From a long distance away, his father saw him coming,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">dressed as a beggar,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">and great compassion swelled up in his heart for his son who was returning home. The father raced out to meet him, swept him up in his arms, hugged him dearly, and kissed him over and over with tender love.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">&apos;Then the son said, &apos;Father, I was wrong. I have sinned against you. I could never deserve to be called your son. Just let me be&apos;&apos; &apos;The father interrupted and said, &apos;Son, you&apos;re home now!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">&apos;Turning to his servants, the father said, &apos;Quick, bring me the best robe, my very own robe, and I will place it on his shoulders. Bring the ring, the seal of sonship,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">and I will put it on his finger. And bring out the best shoes</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">you can find for my son.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">Let&apos;s</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">prepare a great feast</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">and celebrate.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">For my beloved son was once dead, but now he&apos;s alive! Once he was lost, but now he is found!&apos; And everyone celebrated with overflowing joy.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">&apos;Now, the older son was out working in the field when his brother returned, and as he approached the house, he heard the music of celebration and dancing.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">He called over one of the servants and asked, &apos;What&apos;s going on?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">&apos;The servant replied, &apos;It&apos;s your younger brother. He&apos;s returned home and your father is throwing a party to celebrate his homecoming.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">&apos;The older son became angry and refused to go in and celebrate. So his father came out and pleaded with him, &apos;Come and enjoy the feast with us!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">&apos;The son said, &apos;Father, listen! How many years have I worked like a slave for you, performing every duty you&apos;ve asked as a faithful son?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">And I&apos;ve never once disobeyed you. But you&apos;ve never thrown a party for me because of my faithfulness. Never once have you even given me a goat that I could feast on and celebrate with my friends as this son of yours is doing now.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">Look at him! He comes back after wasting your wealth on prostitutes and reckless living, and here you are throwing a great feast to celebrate&apos;for him!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">&apos;The father said, &apos;My son, you are always with me by my side. Everything I have is yours to enjoy.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">It&apos;s only right to rejoice and celebrate like this, because your brother was once dead and gone, but now he is alive and back with us again. He was lost, but now he is found!&apos; &apos;</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="16">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Jesus taught his disciples using this story: &apos;Once a very rich man hired a manager to run his business and oversee all his wealth. But soon a rumor spread that the manager was wasting his master&apos;s money.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">So the master called him in and said, &apos;Is it true that you are mismanaging my estate? You need to provide me with a complete audit of everything you oversee for me. I&apos;ve decided to dismiss you.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">&apos;The manager thought, &apos;Now what am I going to do? I&apos;m finished here. I can&apos;t hide what I&apos;ve done,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">and I&apos;m too proud to beg.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">I have an idea that will secure my future. It will win me favor and secure friends who can take care of me and help me when I get fired!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">&apos;So the dishonest manager hatched his scheme. He went to everyone who owed his master money, one by one, and asked them, &apos;How much do you owe my master?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">&apos;Even though his master was defrauded, when he found out about the shrewd way this manager had feathered his own nest, he congratulated the clever scoundrel for what he&apos;d done to provide for his future.&apos; Jesus continued, &apos;Remember this: The sons of darkness interact more wisely than the sons of light.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Use the wealth of this world to demonstrate your friendship with God by winning friends and blessing others. Then, when it runs out, your generosity will provide you with an eternal reward.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">&apos;The one who faithfully manages the little he has been given will be promoted and trusted with greater responsibilities. But those who cheat with the little they have been given will not be considered trustworthy to receive more.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">If you have not handled the riches of this world with integrity, why should you be trusted with the eternal treasures of the spiritual world?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">And if you&apos;ve not proven yourself faithful with what belongs to another, why should you be given wealth of your own?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">It is impossible for a person to serve two masters at the same time. You will be forced to love one and reject the other. One master will be despised and the other will have your loyal devotion. Your choice between God and the wealth of this world</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">is no different. You must enthusiastically love one and definitively reject the other.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Now, the Jewish religious leaders listening to Jesus were lovers of money. They laughed at what he said and mocked his teachings,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">so Jesus addressed them directly.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">&apos;You always want to look spiritual in the eyes of others, but you have forgotten the eyes of God, which see what is inside you. The very things that you approve of and applaud are the things God despises.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">The law of Moses and the revelation of the prophets have prepared you for the arrival of the kingdom announced by John. Since that time, the wonderful news of God&apos;s kingdom is being preached, and people&apos;s hearts burn with extreme passion to receive it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Heaven and earth will disintegrate before even the smallest detail of the Law will fail or lose its power.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">&apos;It is wrong for you to divorce</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">your wife so that you can marry another&apos;that is adultery. And when you take that one you lusted after as your wife, and contribute to the breakup of her marriage, you commit adultery again.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Jesus continued.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">&apos;There once was a very rich man who had the finest things imaginable,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">living every day enjoying his life of opulent luxury.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">&apos;One day poor Lazarus died, and the angels of God came and escorted his spirit into paradise.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">&apos;The day came that the rich man also died. In hell he looked up from his torment and saw Abraham in the distance, and Lazarus was standing beside him in the glory.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">The rich man shouted, &apos;Father Abraham! Father Abraham! Have mercy on me. Send Lazarus to dip his finger in water and come to cool my tongue, for I am in agony in these flames of fire!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">&apos;But Abraham responded, &apos;My friend, don&apos;t you remember? While you were alive, you had all you desired. You surrounded yourself in luxury, while Lazarus had nothing. Now Lazarus dwells in the comforts of paradise and you are in agony.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">Besides, between us is a huge chasm that cannot be bridged, nor can anyone cross from one realm to the other, even if he wanted.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">&apos;The rich man continued, &apos;Then let me ask you, Father Abraham, please send Lazarus to my relatives.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">Tell him to witness to my five brothers and warn them not to end up where I am in this place of torment.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">&apos;Abraham replied, &apos;They&apos;ve already had plenty of warning. They have the teachings of Moses and the</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">revelation of the</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">prophets; let them hear them.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">&apos; &apos;What if they&apos;re not listening?&apos; the rich man added. &apos;If someone from the dead were to go and warn them, they would surely repent.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">&apos;Abraham said to him, &apos;If they wouldn&apos;t listen to Moses and the prophets, neither would they be convinced if someone</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">were raised from the dead!&apos; &apos;</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="17">
			<VERS vnumber="1">One day Jesus taught his disciples:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">&apos;Betrayals</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">are inevitable, but great devastation will come to the one guilty of betraying others.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">It would be better for him to have a heavy boulder tied around his neck and be hurled into the deepest sea than to face the punishment of betraying one of my dear ones! So be alert to your brother&apos;s condition,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">and if you see him going the wrong direction, cry out and correct him. If there is true repentance on his part, forgive him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">No matter how many times in one day your brother sins against you</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">and says, &apos;I&apos;m sorry; I am changing; forgive me,&apos; you need to forgive him each and every time.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Upon hearing this, the apostles said to Jesus, &apos;Lord, you must increase</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">our measure of faith!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Jesus responded,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">&apos;If you have even the smallest measure of faith, it would be powerful enough to say to this large</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">tree, &apos;My faith will pull you up by the roots and throw you into the sea,&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">and it will respond to your faith</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">and obey you.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Does the servant expect to be thanked for doing what is required of him?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">So learn this lesson: After doing all that is commanded of you, simply say, &apos;We are mere servants, undeserving of special praise, for we are just doing what is expected of us and fulfilling our duties.&apos; &apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">On his way to Jerusalem Jesus passed through the border region between Samaria and Galilee.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">As he entered one village, ten men approached him, but they kept their distance, for they were lepers.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">They shouted to him, &apos;Mighty Lord, our wonderful Master!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Won&apos;t you have mercy on us</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">and heal us</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">When Jesus stopped to look at them, he spoke these words:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">&apos;Go to be examined by the Jewish priests.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">They set off, and they were healed while walking along the way.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">One of them,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">a Samaritan</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">when he discovered that he was completely healed, turned back to find Jesus, shouting out joyous praises and glorifying God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">When he found Jesus, he fell down at his feet and thanked him over and over, saying to him, &apos;You are the Messiah.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">&apos;So where are the other nine?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Jesus asked.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">&apos;Weren&apos;t there ten who were healed?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">They all refused to return to give thanks and give glory to God except you, a foreigner from Samaria?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Then Jesus said to the healed man lying at his feet,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">&apos;Arise and go. It was your faith that brought you salvation and made you whole.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Jesus was once asked by the Jewish religious leaders, &apos;When will God&apos;s kingdom come?&apos; Jesus responded, &apos;God&apos;s kingdom does not come simply by obeying principles or waiting for signs.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">The kingdom is not discovered in one place or another, for God&apos;s kingdom realm is already expanding within some of you.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Later, Jesus addressed this again with his apostles, saying,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">&apos;The time is coming when a great passion will be awakened within you to see me again. Yes, you will long to see the beginning of the days of the Son of Man, but you won&apos;t be able to find me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">You will hear reports from some who will say, &apos;Look, he has returned,&apos; &apos;He&apos;s over here,&apos; or, &apos;He&apos;s over there!&apos; Don&apos;t believe it or run after them,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">for their claims will be false.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">The day of the Son of Man will burst forth with the brightness of a lightning strike that shines from one end of the sky to the other, illuminating the earth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">&apos;But before this takes place, the Son of Man must pass through great suffering and rejection from this generation.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">The same things that happened in the days of Noah will take place in the days of the Son of Man.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">They were eating, they were drinking, they were marrying, and they were given in marriage until the day Noah boarded the ark and the devastating flood came and swept them all away.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">&apos;On that day, if one is outside,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">he won&apos;t even have time to go back into the house to gather his belongings. And those toiling in their fields won&apos;t have time to run back home.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">Don&apos;t forget the example of Lot&apos;s wife and what happened to her when she turned back.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">All who are obsessed with being secure in life will lose it all&apos;including their lives. But those who let go of their lives and surrender them to me will discover true life.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">For in that night there will be two lying in their bed; one will be suddenly swept away while the other will be left</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">alive</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">His apostles asked, &apos;Lord, where will this</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">judgment</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">happen?&apos; Jesus responded, &apos; It will be obvious , for wherever there are those spiritually dead, there you will find the eagles circling.&apos;</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="18">
			<VERS vnumber="1">One day Jesus taught the apostles to keep praying and never stop or lose hope. He shared with them this illustration:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">&apos;In a certain town there was a judge, a thick-skinned and godless man who had no fear of others&apos; opinions.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">And in the same town there was a poor widow who kept pleading with the judge, &apos;Grant me justice and protect me from my oppressor!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Jesus continued,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">&apos;Did you hear what the godless judge said&apos;that he would answer her persistent request?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Don&apos;t you know that God, the true judge, will grant justice to all his chosen ones who cry out to him night and day? He will pour out his Spirit upon them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">He will not delay to answer you and give you what you ask for.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">God will give swift justice to those who don&apos;t give up. So be ever praying, ever expecting, in the same way as the widow. Even so, when the Son of Man comes back, will he find this kind of undying faith on earth?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Jesus taught this parable to those who were convinced they were morally upright and to those who trusted in their own virtue yet looked down on others with disgust:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">&apos;Two men who went into the temple to pray. One was a proud religious leader, the other a despised tax collector.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">&apos;The tax collector stood alone in a corner,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">away from the Holy Place</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">, and covered his face in his hands, feeling that he was unworthy even to look up to God. Beating his breast,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">he sobbed with brokenness and tears saying, &apos;God, please, in your mercy</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">and because of the blood sacrifice, forgive me,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">for I am nothing but the most miserable of all sinners!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">&apos;Which one of them left for home that day reconciled to God? The humble tax collector, not the religious leader! For everyone who praises himself will one day be publicly humiliated, and everyone who humbles himself will one day be publicly honored and lifted up.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">The people brought their babies and small children</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">to Jesus so that he might lay his hands on them to bless them. When the disciples saw this, they scolded the parents and told them to stop troubling the Master.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Seeing what was happening, Jesus called for the parents, the children, and his disciples to come and listen to him. Then he told them,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">&apos;Never hinder a child from coming to me but let them all come, for God&apos;s kingdom belongs to them as much as it does to anyone else.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">These children demonstrate to you what faith is all about.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Learn this well: unless you receive the revelation of the kingdom the same way a little child receives it, you will never be able to enter in.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">One day a wealthy Jewish nobleman of high standing posed this question to Jesus: &apos;Wonderful Teacher, what must I do to receive eternal life?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Jesus answered,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">&apos;Why would you call me wonderful when there is only one who is wonderful&apos;and that is God alone?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">You already know what is right and what the commandments teach: &apos;Do not commit adultery, do not murder, do not steal, do not lie, and honor your father and your mother.&apos; &apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">The wealthy leader replied, &apos;These are the very things I&apos;ve been doing for as long as I can remember.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">&apos;Ah,&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Jesus said,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">&apos;there&apos;s still one thing you&apos;re missing in your life.&apos; &apos;What is that?&apos; asked the man. &apos;You must go and sell everything you own and give all the proceeds to the poor so you will have eternal treasures. Then come and follow me.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">These words devastated the rich leader, for he was extremely wealthy.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">Jesus saw his disappointment, and looking right at him said,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">&apos;It is next to impossible for those who have everything to enter into God&apos;s kingdom.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">Nothing could be harder! You could compare it to trying to stuff a rope through the eye of a needle.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">Those who heard this said, &apos;Then who can be saved?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">Jesus responded,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">&apos;What appears humanly impossible is more than possible with God. For God can do what man cannot.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">Peter said, &apos;Master, see how we&apos;ve left all that we have, our houses and our careers, to follow you.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">Jesus took the Twelve aside and told them in private,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">&apos;We are going to Jerusalem so that everything prophesied about the Son of Man will be fulfilled.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">They will betray him and hand him over to the people, and they will mock him, insult him, and spit in his face.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">And after they have abused</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">and flogged the Son of Man, they will kill him. But in three days he will rise again.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">The disciples had no clue what he was saying, for his words were a mystery that was hidden from them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">As Jesus and his followers arrived at Jericho, a blind beggar was sitting by the roadside.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">When he heard the crowd approaching, he asked, &apos;What&apos;s all this commotion about?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">&apos;It&apos;s Jesus!&apos; they said. &apos;Jesus the Nazarene is passing by.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">The blind beggar shouted, &apos;Jesus, Son of David,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">have pity and show me mercy!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">Those in the front of the crowd scolded him and warned him to be quiet, but the blind beggar screamed out even louder, &apos;Jesus, Son of David, show me mercy!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">Suddenly Jesus stopped and directed those nearby,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">&apos;Bring the man over to me.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">When they brought him before Jesus, he asked the man,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">&apos;What do you want me to do for you?&apos; &apos;Master,&apos; he said, &apos;please, I want to see.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">Jesus said,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">&apos;Now you will see. Receive your sight this moment, for your faith in me has given you sight and new life.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43">Instantly he could see again. His eyes popped open, and he saw Jesus</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43">standing in front of him</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43">! He shouted loud praises to God and he followed Jesus. And when the crowd saw what happened, they too erupted with shouts of praise to God.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="19">
			<VERS vnumber="1">On his way to Jerusalem</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">, Jesus had to pass through Jericho.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">There lived a very wealthy man named Zacchaeus,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">who supervised all the tax collectors.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">He was very eager to see Jesus and kept trying to get a look at him through the massive crowd. Since Zacchaeus was a short man and couldn&apos;t see over the heads of the people,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">he ran on ahead of everyone and climbed up a blossoming fig tree</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">to get a glimpse of Jesus as he passed by.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">When Jesus got to that place, he looked up into the tree and said,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">&apos;Zacchaeus, hurry on down, for I must</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">stay at your house today!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">So he scurried down the tree and found himself face-to-face with Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">As Jesus left to go with Zacchaeus, many in the crowd complained, &apos;Look at this! Of all the people to have dinner</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">with, he&apos;s going to eat in the house of a crook.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Zacchaeus was amazed over his gracious visit to his home and joyously welcomed Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Zacchaeus stood in front of the Lord and said, &apos;Half of all that I own I will give to the poor. And Lord, if I have cheated anyone, I promise to pay them back four times as much as I stole.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Jesus said to him,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">&apos;Your repentance shows that today life</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">has come to you and your household, and that you are a true son of Abraham.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">The Son of Man has come to seek out and to give life to those who are lost.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">At this time Jesus was getting close to entering Jerusalem. The crowds that followed him were convinced that God&apos;s kingdom would fully manifest when Jesus established it in Jerusalem.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">So he told them this story to change their perspective: &apos;Once a wealthy prince left his province to travel to a distant land, where he would be crowned king and then return.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Before he departed he summoned his ten servants together and charged them, &apos;I am entrusting each of you with fifty thousand dollars</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">to invest while I am away. Trade with it and put the money to work until I return.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">&apos;Some of his countrymen despised the prince and sent a delegation after him to declare before the royals, &apos;We refuse to let this man rule over us! He will not be our king!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">&apos;Nevertheless, he was crowned king and returned to his land. Then he summoned his ten servants to see how much each one had earned and what their profits came to.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">&apos;The first one came forward and said, &apos;Master, I took what you gave me and invested it, and it multiplied ten times.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">&apos; &apos;Splendid! You have done well, my excellent servant. Because you have shown that I can trust you in this small matter, I now grant you authority to rule over ten cities.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">&apos;The second came and said, &apos;Master, what you left with me has multiplied five times.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">&apos;His master said, &apos;I also grant you authority in my kingdom over five cities.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">&apos;Another came before the king and said, &apos;Master, here is the money you entrusted to me. I hid it for safekeeping.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">You see, I live in fear of you, for everyone knows you are a strict master and impossible to please. You push us for a high return on all that you own, and you always want to gain from someone else&apos;s efforts.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">&apos;The king said, &apos;You wicked servant! I will judge you using your own words. If what you said about me is true, that I am a harsh man, pushing you for a high return and wanting gain from others&apos; efforts,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">why didn&apos;t you at least put my money in the bank</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">to earn some interest on it?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">&apos;The king said to his other servants, &apos;Take the money he has and give it to the faithful servant who multiplied my money ten times over.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">&apos; &apos;But master,&apos; the other servants objected, &apos;why give it to him? He already has so much!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">&apos; &apos;Yes,&apos; replied the king. &apos;But to all who have been faithful, I will give even more to them. And for the ones who have nothing, even the little they seem to have I will take from them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">Now, bring all those rebellious enemies of mine who rejected me as their king&apos;bring them here before me and execute them!&apos; &apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">After saying all of this, Jesus headed straight for Jerusalem.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">When he arrived at the stables of Annia</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">near the Mount of Olives,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">he sent two of his disciples ahead, saying,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">&apos;When you enter the next village,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">you will find tethered there a donkey&apos;s young colt that has never been ridden. Untie it and bring it to me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">And if anyone stops you and asks, &apos;What are you doing?&apos; just tell them this: &apos;It is needed for the Lord.&apos; &apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">The two disciples entered the village and found the colt exactly like Jesus had said.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">While they were untying it, the owners confronted them and asked, &apos;What are you doing?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">The disciples replied, &apos;We need this donkey for the Lord.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">As soon as he got to the bottom of the Mount of Olives, the crowd of his followers shouted with a loud outburst of ecstatic joy over all the mighty wonders of power they had witnessed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">They shouted over and over, &apos;Highest praises to God for the one who comes as King in the name of the Lord! Heaven&apos;s peace and glory from the highest realm</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">now comes to us</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">Some Jewish religious leaders who stood off from the procession said to Jesus, &apos;Teacher, order your followers at once to stop saying these things!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">Jesus responded,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">&apos;Listen to me. If my followers were silenced, the very stones would break forth with praises!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">When Jesus caught sight of the city, he burst into tears with uncontrollable weeping over Jerusalem,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">saying,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">&apos;If only you could recognize that this day peace is within your reach! But you cannot see it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43">For the day is soon coming when your enemies will surround you, hem you in on every side, and lay siege to you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44">They will crush you to pieces, and your children too! And they will leave your city totally destroyed. Since you would not recognize God&apos;s day of visitation, you will see your day of devastation!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45">Jesus entered the temple area and forcibly threw out all the merchants from their stalls.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46">He rebuked them, saying,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46">&apos;The Scriptures declare, &apos;My Father&apos;s house is to be filled with prayer&apos;a house of prayer,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46">not a cave of bandits!&apos; &apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="47">From then on Jesus continued teaching in the temple area, but the high priests, the experts of the law, and the prominent men of the city kept trying to find a strategy to accuse Jesus, for they wanted him dead.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="48">They could find no reason to accuse him, for he was a hero to the people and the crowds were awestruck by every word he spoke.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="20">
			<VERS vnumber="1">One day Jesus was teaching in the temple courts and sharing with the people the wonderful news of salvation.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">The high priest, the experts of the law, and the prominent men of the city confronted Jesus and asked him,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">&apos;We want to know right now by what authority are you teaching here in the temple? And who gave you the authority to teach these things?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Jesus responded,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">&apos;First, let me ask you a question and you tell me right now.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Did John baptize because he had a commission from heaven or merely from men?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">His interrogators pulled themselves aside to consider how to respond to Jesus. &apos;What should we say? If we say that John&apos;s mandate was from heaven, he will ask us, &apos;Then why didn&apos;t you believe him</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">and be baptized</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">But if we say, &apos;John&apos;s mandate was merely from men,&apos; then all the people around him will stone us, for they believe John was a prophet of God.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">So unable to devise an answer they said to Jesus, &apos;We cannot tell where John&apos;s authority came from.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Jesus said,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">&apos;Then neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Jesus taught the people using this story: &apos;A man once planted a vineyard, then leased it out to tenants. Then he left to go abroad and was away for a long time.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">At harvest time, the owner sent one of his servants to the tenants to collect the landowner&apos;s share of the harvest, but the tenants sent him away, beaten and empty-handed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">So the owner dispatched another one of his servants to collect his portion, but the tenants treated him the same way. They cursed him, beat him, and sent him away empty-handed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Then the owner sent a third servant, but they brutalized him also with the same treatment.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Finally the owner of the vineyard said to his son, &apos;Perhaps if I send you, my own cherished son, they will be ashamed of what they&apos;ve done.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">&apos;But when the tenants saw the son coming, they schemed among themselves. &apos;This is the heir of the vineyard! If we kill him, the inheritance will be ours.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">So they threw the son off the property and killed him. &apos;I ask you, what do you think the owner of the vineyard will do to his son&apos;s murderers?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">He will come back and destroy them and give his vineyard to another.&apos; When the people heard this story, they all agreed, &apos;This should never happen!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Jesus looked straight at the people and their leaders and said,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">&apos;What do you think this verse means? &apos;The worthless, rejected stone has become the cornerstone, the most important stone of all.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Everyone who falls</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">in humility</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">upon that stone will be broken. But if that stone falls on you, it will grind you to pieces!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">When the high priests and experts of the law realized that this story was about them, they wanted to have Jesus arrested that very moment, but they were afraid of all the people.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Later, they sent spies who pretended to be honest seekers, but who wanted an opportunity to entangle Jesus by his words. Their plan was to catch him saying something against the government, so they could hand him over to the jurisdiction of the Roman authorities</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">who would execute him for sedition</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">At the right time they asked him this question: &apos;Teacher, we know that all you say is straightforward and what you teach us is right. You give us the true ways of God. You&apos;re one who shows no favoritism to anyone&apos;s status. So we ask you&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">is it proper or not to pay taxes</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">to a corrupt government</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">Jesus saw right through their cunning ploy and said,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">&apos;Why are you testing me?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">Show me one of the Roman coins. Whose head is on the coin? Whose title is stamped on it?&apos; They answered, &apos;Why, it&apos;s Caesar&apos;s.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">Jesus said,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">&apos;Precisely. The coin</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">bears the image of the Emperor Caesar, and you should give back to Caesar all that belongs to him. But you bear the image of God. So give back to God all that belongs to him.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">The imposters were left speechless and amazed in the presence of all the people, unable to trap Jesus with his words.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">Some of the Sadducees (a religious group that denies there is a resurrection of the dead) came to ask Jesus this question:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">&apos;Teacher, the law of Moses</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">teaches that if a man dies before he has children, his brother should marry the widow and raise up children for his brother&apos;s family line.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">Now suppose there was a family with seven brothers, and the oldest married and died without children.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">Then finally, the widow died too. So here&apos;s our dilemma:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">Whose wife will the woman be when she&apos;s resurrected from the dead? Which of the brothers will be her husband, since all seven were once married to her?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">Jesus replied,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">&apos;Marriage is meant for this world only.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">Even Moses taught the resurrection of the dead</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">when he wrote of the Lord God who was at the burning bush and said &apos;I am the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">Don&apos;t you agree that God is not the God of the dead, but the God of the living? For in his eyes, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob are alive forevermore. He is the God who raises the dead.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">The experts of the law</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">chimed in, &apos;Yes, Teacher, you speak the truth beautifully.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">From then on, the religious Sadducees never dared ask Jesus a question again.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">Jesus then posed this question to the people:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">&apos;How can the experts of the law</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">say that Messiah is David&apos;s son?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">Haven&apos;t you read in the Psalms where David himself wrote: The Lord Yahweh said to my Lord, &apos;Sit near me in the place of authority</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43">until I subdue all your enemies under Your feet!&apos; &apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44">Jesus explained,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44">&apos;If David calls this one &apos;my Lord,&apos; how can he be his son?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45">Within earshot of all the people, Jesus warned his disciples,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46">&apos;Don&apos;t follow the example of these pretentious experts of the law! They love to parade around in their religious garments so that people honor them wherever they go. They like to sit right up front in every meeting and push their way to the head table at every banquet.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="47">And for an offering they will pray long religious prayers at the homes of widows,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="47">cheating them out of their very livelihood. Beware of them all, because one day the Judge will strip them of honor, and judge them severely.&apos;</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="21">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Jesus observed all the wealthy coming into the temple courts wanting to be noticed as they came with their offerings.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">He noticed a very poor widow who dropped two small copper coins in the offering box.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">&apos;Listen to me,&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">he said.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">&apos;This poor widow has given a larger offering than any of the wealthy.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">For the rich only gave out of their surplus, but she sacrificed out of her poverty and gave to God all that she had to live on.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Some of the disciples remarked about the beauty of the temple. They pointed out all the lovely adornments and how it was built with excellence from the gifts given to God. Jesus said,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">&apos;The day of utter destruction will come to everything you admire here. It will all become a heap of rubble!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">&apos;Master, tell us,&apos; they asked, &apos;when exactly will this happen? Can you tell us what warning sign to look for when it is about to take place?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Jesus responded,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">&apos;Deception will run rampant and many will appear on the scene, saying I have sent them, or saying about themselves, &apos;I am the Messiah!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">These doomsday deceivers will say, &apos;The end of the age is now here!&apos; But listen to me. Don&apos;t let any of these imposters fool you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">&apos;There will also be many wars and revolutions on every side, with rumors of more wars to come. Don&apos;t panic or give in to your fears, for these things are bound to happen. This is still not the end yet.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Jesus continued,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">There will be upheavals of every kind.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Nations will go to war against each other, and kingdom against kingdom.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">There will be terrible earthquakes and seismic events of epic proportion that result in famines in one place after another. There will be horrible plagues and epidemics, cataclysmic storms</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">on the earth, and astonishing signs and cosmic disturbances in the heavens. But before all of this happens, you will be hunted down and arrested, persecuted by both civil and religious authorities, and thrown into prison.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">&apos;You can expect betrayal even by your parents, your brothers, your relatives and friends&apos;and yes, some of you will die as martyrs.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">You will be hated by all because</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">of my life in you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">But don&apos;t worry. My grace will never desert you or depart from your life.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Stand firm with patient endurance and you will find your souls&apos; deliverance.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">&apos;When you see Jerusalem surrounded by armies, you will know for sure that its devastation is imminent.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">At that time all who are living in Judea must flee to the mountains. Those who live inside the city gates, leave and flee, and those who live outside the city must not enter it seeking refuge.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">For these will be the days of God&apos;s vengeance to fulfill what has been written</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">against Jerusalem.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">It will be extremely difficult for pregnant women and for those nursing little ones in that day, for great persecution and wrath will rise against this nation.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">Many will be cut down by the sword or scattered as prisoners to many countries. And Jerusalem shall be trampled down by nations until the days of world empires come to an end.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">&apos;Expect to witness amazing and perplexing signs with the sun, the moon, and the stars.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">The raging of the sea will bring desperation and turmoil to many nations.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">Earthquakes</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">will bring panic and disaster. What men see coming to the earth will cause the fear of doom to grip their hearts, for they will even see the powers of the heavenly realm shaken!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">In the same way, when you see these prophetic signs occurring, you realize the earth is yielding to</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">the fullness of</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">God&apos;s kingdom.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">I assure you, the end of this age will not come until all I have spoken has come to pass.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">Earth and sky will wear out and fade away before one word I speak loses its power or fails to accomplish its purpose.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">&apos;Be careful that you never allow your hearts to grow cold. Be careful that you are not caught off guard,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">or your hearts will be weighed down with carousing, drunkenness, and the worries of this life, and that day will come upon you suddenly like a trap. Don&apos;t let me come and find you drunk or living carelessly like everyone else.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">For that day will come as a shocking surprise to all.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">Keep a constant watch over your soul, and pray for the courage and grace to prevail over these things that are destined to occur and that you will stand before the presence of the Son of Man</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">with a clear conscience</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">Each day, Jesus taught in the temple and spent his nights on the Mount of Olives.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">And all the people came early to the temple courts to listen to the words</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">he taught.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="22">
			<VERS vnumber="3">At that time Satan himself entered into Judas the locksmith,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">who was one of the twelve apostles.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">He secretly went to the religious hierarchy and the captains of the temple guards to discuss with them how he could betray Jesus and turn him over to their hands.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">The religious hierarchy was elated over Judas&apos; treachery, and they agreed to give him a sum of money in exchange for Jesus&apos; betrayal.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Judas vowed that he would find them a suitable opportunity to betray Jesus when he was away from the crowds.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">They asked him, &apos;Where do we make the preparations to eat the meal?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Jesus gave them this sign:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">&apos;When you enter the city, you will find a man</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">carrying a jug of water.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Follow him home</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">and say to the owner of the house, &apos;The Teacher told us to ask you, &apos;Where is the room I may use to have the Passover meal with my disciples?&apos; &apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">He will then take you to a large, fully furnished upstairs room. Make the preparations for us there.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">They went and found everything to be exactly like Jesus had prophesied, and they prepared the Passover meal.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">When Jesus arrived at the upper room, he took his place at the table along with all the apostles.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Then he told them,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">&apos;I have longed with passion and desire to eat this Passover lamb with you before I endure my sufferings.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">I promise you that the next time we eat this, we will be together in the feast of God&apos;s kingdom.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Then he raised a cup and gave thanks to God and said to them,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">&apos;Take this and pass it on to one another and drink.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">I promise you that the next time we drink this wine, we will be together in the feast of God&apos;s kingdom.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Then he lifted up a loaf, and after praying a prayer of thanksgiving to God, he gave each of his apostles a piece of bread, saying,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">&apos;This loaf is my body,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">which is now being offered to you. Always eat it to remember me.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">After supper was over, he lifted the cup again and said,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">&apos;This cup is my blood of the new covenant</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">I make with you, and it will be poured out soon for all of you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">But I want you to know that the hands of the one who delivers me to be the sacrifice are with mine on the table this very moment.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">The Son of Man must now go where he will be sacrificed. But there will be great and unending doom for the man who betrays me.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">The apostles questioned among themselves which one of them was about to do this.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">The disciples bickered over which one of them would be considered the greatest</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">in the kingdom.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">Jesus interrupted their argument, saying,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">&apos;The kings and men of authority in this world rule oppressively over their subjects, claiming that they do it for the good of the people. They are obsessed with how others see them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">But this is not your calling. You will lead by a different model. The greatest one among you will live as one called to serve others without honor.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">The greatest honor and authority is reserved for the one who has a servant heart.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">The leaders who are served are the most important in your eyes, but in the kingdom, it is the servants who lead. Am I not here with you as one who serves?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">&apos;Because you have stood with me through all my trials and ordeals,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">I am promising you the kingdom that the Father has promised me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">We will celebrate in this kingdom and you will feast with me at my table. And each of you will be given a throne, twelve thrones in all, and you will be made rulers on thrones to judge the tribes of Israel.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">&apos;Peter, my dear friend, listen to what I&apos;m about to tell you. Satan has obtained permission to come and sift you all like wheat and test your faith.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">But I have prayed for you, Peter, that you would stay faithful to me no matter what comes. Remember this: after you have turned back to me and have been restored, make it your life mission to strengthen the faith of your brothers.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">&apos;But Lord,&apos; Peter replied, &apos;I am ready to stand with you to the very end, even if it means prison or death!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">Jesus looked at him and prophesied,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">&apos;Before the rooster crows in the morning, you will deny</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">three times that you even know me.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">Then he said to all of them,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">&apos;When I sent you out empty-handed, did you lack anything?&apos; &apos;Not a thing,&apos; they answered. &apos;God provided all we needed.&apos; Jesus said, &apos;But now I say to you: Take what you need.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">If you have money, take it</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">&apos;and a knapsack and a sword.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">Danger is imminent.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">For the prophetic Scripture about me &apos;He will be accused of being a criminal&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">will now come to pass. All that was prophesied of me will be fulfilled.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">The disciples told him, &apos;Lord, we already have two swords!&apos; &apos;You still don&apos;t understand,&apos; Jesus responded.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">Jesus left the upper room with his disciples</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">and, as was his habit, went to the Mount of Olives,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">his place of secret prayer</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">There he told the apostles,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">&apos;Keep praying for strength to be spared from the severe test of your faith that is about to come.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">Then he withdrew from them a short distance</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">to be alone. Kneeling down, he prayed,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">&apos;Father, if you are willing, take this cup of agony away from me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">But no matter what, your will must be mine.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43">Jesus called</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43">for an angel of glory to strengthen him, and the angel appeared.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44">He prayed even more passionately, like one being sacrificed,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44">until he was in such intense agony of spirit that his sweat became drops of blood, dripping onto the ground.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45">When Jesus finished praying, he got up and went to his disciples and found them all asleep, for they were exhausted and overwhelmed with sorrow.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46">&apos;Why are you sleeping?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46">he asked them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46">&apos;You need to be alert and pray for the strength to endure the great temptation.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="47">No sooner had he finished speaking when suddenly a mob approached, and in front of the mob was his disciple Judas. He walked up close to Jesus and greeted him with a kiss. For he had agreed to give the religious leaders a sign, saying, &apos;The one I kiss is the one to seize.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="48">Jesus looked at him with sorrow and said,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="48">&apos;A kiss, Judas? Are you really going to betray the Son of Man with a kiss?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="49">When the other disciples understood what was happening, they asked, &apos;Lord, shall we fight them with our swords?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="50">Just then, one of the disciples swung his sword at the high priest&apos;s servant and slashed off his right ear.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="51">Jesus stopped the incident from escalating any further by saying,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="51">&apos;Enough of this!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="51">Then he touched the right side of the injured man&apos;s head and</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="51">the ear grew back</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="51">&apos;he was healed!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="52">Jesus turned to those who had come to seize him&apos;the ruling priests, the officers of the temple police, and the religious leaders&apos;and said,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="52">&apos;Am I a criminal that you come to capture me with clubs and swords? Wasn&apos;t I with you day after day, teaching in the temple courts?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="53">You could have seized me at any time. But in the darkness of night you have now found your time, for it belongs to you and to the prince of darkness.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="54">The religious leaders seized Jesus and led him away, but Peter followed from a safe distance. They brought him to the home of the high priest, where people were already gathered out in the courtyard.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="55">Someone had built a fire, so Peter inched closer and sat down among them to stay warm.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="56">A girl noticed Peter sitting in the firelight. Staring at him, she pointed him out and said, &apos;This man is one of Jesus&apos; disciples!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="57">Peter flatly denied it, saying, &apos;What are you talking about, girl? I don&apos;t know him!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="58">A little while later, someone else spotted Peter and said, &apos;I recognize you. You&apos;re one of his, I know it!&apos; Peter again said, &apos;I&apos;m not one of his disciples.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="59">About an hour later, someone else identified Peter and insisted he was a disciple of Jesus, saying, &apos;Look at him! He&apos;s from Galilee,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="59">just like Jesus. I know he&apos;s one of them.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="60">But Peter was adamant. &apos;Listen, I don&apos;t know what you&apos;re talking about. Don&apos;t you understand? I don&apos;t even know him.&apos; While the words were still in his mouth, the rooster crowed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="61">At that moment, the Lord, who was being led through the courtyard by his captors,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="61">turned around and gazed at Peter. All at once Peter remembered the words Jesus had prophesied over him,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="61">&apos;Before the rooster crows in the morning, you will deny three times that you even know me.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="62">Peter burst into tears,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="62">ran off from the crowd, and wept bitterly.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="63">Those who were guarding Jesus mocked and beat him severely.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="64">They also made fun of him, blindfolding him and slapping his face and saying, &apos;Prove that you are a prophet and tell us which one of us hit you!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="65">They blasphemed and heaped insult after insult upon him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="66">At daybreak the high priests, the experts of the law, and the top religious leaders convened and had Jesus brought before their council.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="67">They asked him point blank, &apos;Tell us, are you the Christ, the Messiah, or not?&apos; Jesus responded, &apos;If I tell you the truth, you won&apos;t believe me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="68">And if I question you, you will not answer me or release me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="69">But from today on, the Son of Man will be enthroned in the place of honor, power, and authority with Almighty God.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="70">They all shouted, &apos;Then you do claim to be the Son of God?&apos; He said to them, &apos;You are the ones who say I am.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="71">They all shouted, &apos;We&apos;ve heard it from his very lips! What further proof do we need?&apos;</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="23">
			<VERS vnumber="1">The entire council stood at once and took Jesus to Pilate, the Roman governor.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">They accused him of false testimony, saying, &apos;This man tells us not to pay our taxes to Caesar. And he proclaims himself to be Christ the King and Messiah. He&apos;s a deceiver of our nation.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Pilate asked Jesus, &apos;Is this true? Are you their king and Messiah?&apos; Jesus answered, &apos;It is true.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Pilate turned to the high priests and to the gathered crowd and said, &apos;This man has committed no crime. I find nothing wrong with him.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">But they yelled and demanded that Pilate do something, saying, &apos;He has stirred up our nation, misleading people from the moment he began teaching in Galilee until he has come here to Jerusalem!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">When he saw Jesus, he was elated, for he had heard a great deal about his ministry and wanted Jesus to perform a miracle in front of him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Antipas questioned him at length, but Jesus wouldn&apos;t even answer him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">That day, Antipas and Pilate healed their long-standing feud and they became good friends.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">For it was Pilate&apos;s custom to honor the Jewish holiday by releasing a prisoner.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">When the crowd heard this, they went wild. Erupting with anger, they cried out, &apos;No! Take this one away and release Barabbas!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">For Barabbas had been thrown in prison for robbery</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">and murder.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Pilate, wanting to release Jesus, tried to convince them it was best to let Jesus go,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">but they screamed out over and over, &apos;Crucify him! Crucify him!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">A third time, Pilate asked the crowd, &apos;What evil crime has this man committed that I should have him crucified? I haven&apos;t found one thing that warrants a death sentence! I will have him flogged severely and then release him.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">But the people and the high priests, shouting like a mob, screamed out at the top of their lungs, &apos;No! Crucify him! Crucify him!&apos; Finally their shouts and screams succeeded.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">Pilate caved in to the crowd and ordered that the will of the people be done.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">Then he released the guilty murderer Barabbas, as they had insisted, and handed Jesus over to be crucified.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">As the guards led Jesus to be crucified, there was</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">an African man</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">in the crowd named Simon, from Libya.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">He had just arrived from a rural village</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">to keep the Feast of the Passover</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">. The guards laid Jesus&apos; cross on Simon&apos;s shoulders</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">and forced him to walk behind Jesus, carrying his cross.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">Massive crowds gathered to follow Jesus, including a number of women, who were wailing with sorrow over him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">Jesus turned to them and said,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">&apos;Daughters of Jerusalem, do not weep for me. You should be weeping for yourselves and your children.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">The day is coming when it will not be the women with children who are blessed but those who are childless. Then you will say, &apos;The barren women are the most fortunate! Those who have never given birth and never nursed a child&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">they are more fortunate than we, for they will never see their children put to death</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">And the people will cry out for the mountains and hills to fall on top of them to hide them from all that is to come.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">For if this is what they do to the living Branch, what will they do with the dead ones?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">The guards led away two criminals with Jesus, to execute all three at the same time.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">When they came to the place that is known as The Skull, the guards crucified Jesus, nailing him on the center cross between the two criminals.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">While they were nailing Jesus to the cross, he prayed over and over,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">&apos;Father, forgive them,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">for they don&apos;t know what they&apos;re doing.&apos; The soldiers, after they crucified him, gambled over his clothing.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">A great crowd gathered to watch what was happening. The religious leaders sneered at Jesus and mocked him, saying, &apos;Look at this man! What kind of &apos;chosen Messiah&apos; is this? He pretended to save others, but he can&apos;t even save himself!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">The soldiers joined in the mockery, offering Jesus a drink of vinegar.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">One of the criminals hanging on the cross next to Jesus kept ridiculing him, saying, &apos;What kind of Messiah are you? Save yourself and save us from this death!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">The criminal hanging on the other cross rebuked the man, saying, &apos;Don&apos;t you fear God? You&apos;re about to die!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">We deserve to be condemned. We&apos;re just being repaid for what we&apos;ve done. But this man&apos;he&apos;s done nothing wrong!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">Then he said, &apos;I beg of you, Jesus, show me grace and take me with you into your</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">everlasting</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">kingdom!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43">Jesus responded,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43">&apos;I promise you&apos;this very day you will enter paradise with me.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44">It was now only midday, yet the whole world became dark for three hours as the light of the sun faded away.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45">And suddenly in the temple the thick veil hanging in the Holy Place was ripped in two!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46">Then Jesus cried out with a loud voice,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46">&apos;Father, I surrender my Spirit into your hands.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46">And he took his last breath and died.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="47">When the Roman captain overseeing the crucifixion witnessed all that took place, he was awestruck and glorified God. Acknowledging what they had done, he said, &apos;I have no doubt; we just killed the righteous one.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="48">The crowds that had gathered to observe this spectacle went back to their homes, overcome with deep sorrow</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="48">and devastated by what they had witnessed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="49">But standing off at a distance were some who truly knew Jesus, and the women who had followed him all the way from Galilee were keeping vigil.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="52">He came before Pilate and asked permission to take the body of Jesus</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="52">for a proper burial, and Pilate granted his request</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="52">.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="53">So he took the body from the cross, wrapped it in a winding sheet of linen, and placed it in a new, unused tomb chiseled out of solid rock.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="54">It was Preparation Day, and the Sabbath was fast approaching.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="55">The women who had been companions of Jesus from the beginning saw all this take place and carefully contemplated how the body was laid in the tomb.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="56">Afterward they returned home and prepared fragrant spices and ointments and were planning to anoint his body after the Sabbath was completed, according to the commandments of the law.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="24">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Very early that Sunday morning, the women made their way to the tomb, carrying the spices they had prepared.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Among them were Mary Magdalene, Joanna, and Jesus&apos; mother Mary.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Arriving at the tomb they discovered that the huge stone covering the entrance had been rolled aside,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">so they went in to look. But the tomb was empty. The body of Jesus was gone!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">They stood there, stunned and perplexed. Suddenly, two men appeared above them in dazzling white robes shining like lightning.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Terrified, the women fell to the ground on their faces. The men in white said to them, &apos;Why would you look for the Living One in a tomb? He is not here, for he has risen!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Have you forgotten what he said to you while he was still in Galilee:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">&apos;The destiny of the Son of Man is to be handed over to sinful men, to be nailed to a cross, and on the third day to rise again&apos;?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">All at once they remembered his words.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Leaving the tomb, they went to break the news to the Eleven and to all the others of what they had seen and heard.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">When the disciples heard the testimony of the women, it made no sense, and they were unable to believe what they heard.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">But Peter jumped up and ran the entire distance to the tomb to see for himself. Stooping down, he looked inside and discovered it was empty! There was only the linen sheet lying there. Staggered by this, he walked away, wondering what it meant.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Later that same day, two of Jesus&apos; disciples were walking from Jerusalem to Emmaus,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">a journey of about seventeen miles.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">They were unaware that it was actually Jesus walking alongside them, for God prevented them from recognizing him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Jesus asked,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">&apos;What things?&apos; &apos;The things about Jesus, the man from Nazareth,&apos; they replied. &apos;He was a mighty prophet of God who performed miracles and wonders. His words were powerful and he had great favor with God and the people.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Early this morning, some of the women informed us of something amazing.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">They said they went to the tomb and found it empty. They claimed two angels appeared and told them that Jesus is now alive.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">Some of us went to see for ourselves and found the tomb exactly as the women had said. But no one has seen him.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">Jesus said to them,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">&apos;Why are you so thick-headed? Why do you find it so hard to believe every word the prophets have spoken?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">Wasn&apos;t it necessary for the Messiah to experience all these sufferings and afterward to enter into his glory?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">And beginning with Moses and all the prophets he carefully unveiled to them the revelation of himself throughout the Scriptures.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">As they approached the village, Jesus walked on ahead, telling them he was going on to a distant place.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">They urged him to remain there with them and pleaded, &apos;Stay with us. It will be dark soon.&apos; So Jesus went with them into the village.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">Joining them at the table for supper, he took bread and blessed it and broke it, then gave it to them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">All at once their eyes were opened and they realized he was Jesus! Then suddenly, in a flash, Jesus vanished from before their eyes!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">Stunned, they looked at each other and said, &apos;Why didn&apos;t we recognize him? Didn&apos;t our hearts burn with the flames of holy passion</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">while we walked beside him? He unveiled for us such profound revelation from the Scriptures!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">They left at once and hurried back to Jerusalem to tell the other disciples. When they found the Eleven and the other disciples all together,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">they overheard them saying, &apos;It&apos;s really true! The Lord has risen from the dead. He even appeared to Peter!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">Then the two disciples told the others what had happened to them on the road to Emmaus and how Jesus had unveiled himself in the breaking of bread.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">Why are you so frightened? Don&apos;t let doubt enter your hearts.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">See my pierced hands and feet. See for yourselves, it is I, standing here alive. Touch me and know that my wounds are real. A spirit does not have a body of flesh and bone as you see that I have.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">Then he showed them his pierced hands and feet and let them touch his wounds.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">The disciples were ecstatic, yet dumbfounded, unable to fully comprehend it. Knowing that they were still wondering if he was real, Jesus said, &apos;Here, let me show you. Give me something to eat.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44">Then he said to them,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44">&apos;Don&apos;t you remember the words that I spoke to you when I was still with you? I told you that I would fulfill everything written about me, including all the prophecies from the law of Moses through the Psalms and the writings of the prophets.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45">He</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45">supernaturally</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45">unlocked their understanding to receive the revelation of the Scriptures,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46">and said to them,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46">&apos;Everything that has happened fulfills what the Scriptures prophesied of me. The Messiah was destined to suffer and rise from the dead on the third day.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="47">Now you must go into all the nations and preach repentance</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="47">and forgiveness of sins so that they will turn to me. Start right here in Jerusalem,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="48">for you are my witnesses and have seen for yourselves all that has transpired.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="49">I will send the fulfillment of the Father&apos;s promise</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="49">to you, so stay here in the city until you are clothed with the</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="49">mighty</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="49">power of heaven.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="50">Jesus led his disciples out to Bethany. He lifted his hands over them and blessed them in his love.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="51">While he was still speaking words of love and blessing,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="51">he floated off the ground into the sky</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="51">, ascending into heaven before their very eyes!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="52">And all they could do was worship him. Overwhelmed and ecstatic with joy, they made their way back to Jerusalem.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="53">Every day they went to the temple, to praise and worship God.</VERS>

	<BIBLEBOOK bnumber="43" bname="John">
		<CHAPTER cnumber="1">
			<VERS vnumber="1">In the beginning</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">the Living Expression</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">was already there. And the Living Expression was with God, yet fully God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">They were together&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">face-to-face</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">in the very beginning.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">And through his creative inspiration this Living Expression made all things, for nothing has existence apart from him!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">A fountain of</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">life was in him, for his life is light for all humanity.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">And this Light never fails to shine through darkness&apos; Light that darkness could not overcome!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Suddenly</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">a man appeared who was sent from God, a messenger named John.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">For he came as a witness, to point the way to the Light</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">of Life</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">, and to help everyone believe.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">John was not that Light but he came to show who is. For he was merely a messenger to speak the truth about the Light.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">For the perfect Light of Truth</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">was coming into the world and shine upon everyone.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">He entered into the world he created, yet the world was unaware.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">He came to the people he created</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">&apos; to those who should have received him, but they did not recognize him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">But those who embraced him and took hold of his name he gave authority to become the children of God!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">He was not born by the joining of human parents or from natural means, or by a man&apos;s desire, but he was born of God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">And so the Living Expression became a man and lived among us! We gazed upon his glory, the glory of the One and Only who came from the Father overflowing with tender mercy and truth!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">John announced the truth about him when he taught the people, &apos;He&apos;s the One! He&apos;s the One I&apos;ve been telling you would come after me, even though he ranks far above me, because he existed before I was even born.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">And from the overflow of his fullness we received grace heaped upon more grace!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Moses gave us the Law, but Jesus, the Anointed One, unveils truth wrapped in tender mercy.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">No one ever before gazed upon</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">the full splendor of</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">God except his uniquely beloved Son, who is cherished by the Father and held close to his heart. Now that he has come to us, he has unfolded the full explanation of who God truly is!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Now this was John&apos;s testimony when some of the Jewish leaders</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">sent an entourage of priests and temple servants</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">from Jerusalem to interrogate him. &apos;Who are you?&apos; they asked him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">John answered them directly, saying, &apos;I am not the Messiah!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">&apos;Then who are you?&apos; they asked. &apos;Are you Elijah?&apos; &apos;No,&apos; John replied. So they pressed him further, &apos;Are you the prophet Moses said was coming, the one we&apos;re expecting?&apos; &apos;No,&apos; he replied.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">&apos;Then who are you?&apos; they demanded. &apos;We need an answer for those who sent us. Tell us something about yourself&apos;anything!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">John answered them, &apos;I am an urgent, thunderous voice crying out in the desert&apos;clear the way and prepare your hearts for the coming of the Lord Yahweh!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">Then some members of the religious sect known as the Pharisees</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">questioned John,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">&apos;Why do you baptize the people if you are neither the Messiah, Elijah, nor the Prophet?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">All these events took place at Bethany,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">where John was baptizing at the place of the crossing of the Jordan River.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">The very next day, John saw Jesus coming to him to be baptized, and John cried out, &apos;Look! There he is&apos;God&apos;s Lamb!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">He takes away</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">the sin of the entire world!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">I told you that a Mighty One</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">would come who is far greater than I am, because he existed long before I was born!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">My baptism was for the preparation of his appearing to Israel, even though I didn&apos;t recognize him.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">Then, as he baptized Jesus, he proclaimed these words: &apos;I see the Spirit of God appear like a dove descending from the heavenly realm and landing upon him&apos;and it remained on him!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">Before this I didn&apos;t know who he was. But the one who sent me to baptize with water had told me, &apos;You will see the Spirit come down and stay on someone. He will be the One I have sent to baptize with the Holy Spirit.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">Now I have seen this happen and I can tell you for sure that this man is the Son of God.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">And as soon as John&apos;s two disciples heard this, they immediately left John and began to follow a short distance behind Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">Jesus turned around and saw they were following him and asked,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">&apos;What do you want?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">They responded, &apos;Rabbi (which means, Master Teacher</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">), where are you staying?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">Jesus answered,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">&apos;Come and discover for yourselves.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">So they went with him and saw where he was staying, and since it was late in the afternoon, they spent the rest of the day with Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">Then Andrew brought Simon to meet Jesus. When he gazed upon Andrew&apos;s brother, he prophesied to him,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">&apos;You are Simon and your father&apos;s name is John.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">But from now on, everyone will call you Cephas&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">(which means, Peter the Rock).</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43">The next day, Jesus decided to go to Galilee, where he found Philip. Jesus said to him,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43">&apos;Come and follow me.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44">(Now Philip, Andrew, and Peter had all grown up together in the village of Bethsaida.)</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45">Philip went to look for</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45">his friend</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45">, Nathanael,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45">and told him, &apos;We&apos;ve found him! We&apos;ve found the One we&apos;ve been waiting for! It&apos;s Jesus, son of Joseph from Nazareth! He&apos;s the One whom Moses and the prophets prophesied would come!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46">Nathanael</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46">sneered</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46">, &apos;Nazareth! What good thing could ever come from Nazareth?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46">Philip answered, &apos;Come and let&apos;s find out!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="47">When Jesus saw Nathanael approaching, he said,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="47">&apos;Here comes a true son of Israel&apos;an honest man with no hidden motive!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="48">Nathanael was stunned</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="48">and said, &apos;But you&apos;ve never met me&apos;how do you know anything about me?&apos; Jesus answered, &apos;Nathanael, right before Philip came to you, I saw you sitting under the shade of a fig tree.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="49">Nathanael blurted out, &apos;Teacher, you are truly the Son of God and the King of Israel!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="50">Jesus answered,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="50">&apos;Do you believe simply because I told you I saw you sitting under a fig tree? You will experience even more impressive things than that!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="51">I prophesy to you eternal truth:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="51">From now on,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="51">you all will see</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="51">an open heaven and gaze upon the Son of Man</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="51">like a stairway reaching into the sky</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="51">with the messengers of God climbing up and down upon</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="51">him!&apos;</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="2">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Now on the third day,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">Jesus&apos; mother went to a wedding feast in the Galilean village of Cana.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Jesus replied,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">&apos;My dear one, don&apos;t you understand that if I do this, it will change nothing for you, but it will change everything for me!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">My hour</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">of unveiling my power</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">has not yet come.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Mary then went to the servers and told them, &apos;Whatever Jesus tells you, do it!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Nearby stood six stone water pots</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">meant to be used for the Jewish washing rituals.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Each one could hold about twenty gallons or more.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Jesus came to the servers and instructed them,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">&apos;Fill the</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">pots with water, right up to the very brim.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Then he said,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">&apos;Now fill your pitchers and take them to the master of ceremonies.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">And when they poured out their pitchers for the master of ceremonies to sample, the water had become wine! When he tasted the water that had become wine, the master of ceremonies was impressed with its quality. (Although he didn&apos;t know where the wine had come from, only the servers knew.) He called the bridegroom over</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">and said to him, &apos;Every host serves his best wine first, until everyone has had a cup or two, then he serves the cheaper wine. But you, my friend, you&apos;ve reserved the most exquisite wine until now!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">This miracle in Cana was the first of the many extraordinary miracles Jesus performed in Galilee that revealed his glory,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">and his disciples believed in him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">After the wedding, Jesus, his mother and brothers, and his disciples traveled to Capernaum</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">and stayed there for a few days.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">When the time was close for the Jewish Passover to begin, Jesus walked to Jerusalem.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">As he went into the temple courtyard, he noticed it was filled with merchants selling oxen, lambs, and doves</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">for exorbitant prices</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">, while others were overcharging as they exchanged currency</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">behind their counters.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">So Jesus found some cords and made them into a whip. Then he drove out every one of them and their animals from the courtyard of the temple, and he kicked over their tables filled with money, scattering it everywhere!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">And he told the merchants,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">&apos;Get these things out of here! Don&apos;t you dare commercialize my Father&apos;s house!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">That&apos;s when his disciples remembered the Scripture: &apos;I am consumed with a fiery passion to keep your house pure!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Then the Jewish religious leaders challenged Jesus, &apos;What authority do you have to do this sort of thing and what</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">supernatural</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">sign will you show us to prove it?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Jesus answered,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">&apos;Destroy this temple,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">and I will raise it up again in three days.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Then the Jewish leaders sneered at Jesus&apos; answer, &apos;This temple took forty-six years</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">to build, and you mean to tell us that you will raise it up in three days?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">But they failed to understand that</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Jesus was speaking of the &apos;temple&apos; of his body.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">The disciples remembered his prophecy after Jesus rose from the dead, and believed both the Scripture and what Jesus had said.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">While Jesus was at the Passover Feast,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">the number of his followers began to grow</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">, and many gave their allegiance to him because of all the miraculous signs they had seen him doing!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">But Jesus did not yet entrust himself to them, because he knew how fickle human hearts can be.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">He needed no one to tell him about human nature, for he fully understood what man was capable of doing.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="3">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Now there was a prominent religious leader among the Jews named Nicodemus,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">who was part of the sect called the Pharisees.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">One night he discreetly came to Jesus and said, &apos;Rabbi, we know that you are a teacher come from God, for no one performs the miracle signs that you do, unless God&apos;s</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">power</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">is with him.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Jesus answered,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">&apos;Nicodemus, listen to this eternal truth: Before a person can even perceive God&apos;s kingdom, they must first experience a rebirth.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Nicodemus said, &apos;Rebirth? How can a gray-headed man be reborn? It&apos;s impossible for anyone to go back into the womb a second time and be reborn!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Jesus answered,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">&apos;I speak an eternal truth: Unless you are born of water</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">and the Spirit, you will never enter God&apos;s kingdom.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">For the natural realm only gives birth to things that are natural, but the spiritual realm gives birth to supernatural life!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">&apos;You shouldn&apos;t be amazed by my statement,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">&apos;You all must be born from above!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">For the Spirit-Wind blows as it chooses. You can hear its sound,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">but you don&apos;t know where it came from or where it&apos;s going. So it is the same with those who are Spirit-born!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Nicodemus replied, &apos;I don&apos;t understand; what do you mean? How does this happen?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Jesus answered,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">&apos;Nicodemus, aren&apos;t you the respected teacher in Israel, and yet you don&apos;t understand this revelation?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">I speak eternal truths about things I know, things I&apos;ve seen and experienced&apos;and still you don&apos;t accept what I reveal.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">If you&apos;re unable to believe what I&apos;ve told you about the natural realm, what will you do when I begin to unveil the heavenly realm?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">No one has risen into the heavenly realm except the Son of Man who also exists in heaven.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">&apos;And just as Moses in the desert lifted up the brass replica of a venomous snake on a pole</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">for all the people to see and be healed,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">so the Son of Man is ready to be lifted up,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">so that those who truly believe in him</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">will not perish but be given eternal life.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">For here is the way God loved the world&apos;he gave his only, unique Son</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">as a gift.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">So now everyone who believes in him</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">will never perish but experience everlasting life.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">&apos;God did not send his Son into the world to judge and condemn the world, but to be its Savior and rescue it!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">So now there is no longer any condemnation for those who believe in him, but the unbeliever already lives under condemnation because they do not believe in the name of the only Son of God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">And here is the basis for their judgment: The Light</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">of God</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">has now come into the world, but the people loved darkness more than the Light, because they want the darkness to conceal their evil.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">So the wicked hate the Light and try to hide from it, for the Light fully exposes their lives.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">But those who love the truth</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">will come into the Light, for the Light will reveal that it was God who produced their fruitful works.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Then Jesus and his disciples left for a length of time into the Judean countryside where they baptized the people.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">At this time John was still baptizing people at Aenon,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">near Salim,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">where there was plenty of water, and the people kept coming for John to baptize them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">(This was before John was thrown into prison.)</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">An argument started between John&apos;s disciples and a particular Jewish man about baptism.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">So they went to John and asked him, &apos;Teacher, are you aware that the One you told us about at the crossing place&apos;he&apos;s now baptizing crowds larger than yours. People are flocking to him!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">John answered them, &apos;A person cannot receive even one thing unless God bestows it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">You&apos;ve heard me tell you that I am not the Messiah, but certainly I am the messenger sent ahead of him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">He is the Bridegroom,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">and the bride belongs to him. I am the friend</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">of the Bridegroom who stands nearby and listens with great joy to the Bridegroom&apos;s voice. Because of his words, my joy is complete and overflows!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">It is necessary for him to increase</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">and for me to decrease.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">&apos;For the one who is from the earth belongs to the earth and speaks from the natural realm. But the One who comes from above is above everything</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">and speaks of the highest realm of all</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">His message is about what he has seen and experienced, even though people don&apos;t accept it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">Yet those who embrace his message know in their hearts that it&apos;s the truth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">&apos;The One whom God has sent to represent him will speak the words of God, because God has poured out upon him the fullness of the Holy Spirit without limitation.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">The Father loves his Son so much that he has given all things into his hands.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">Those who trust in the Son possess eternal life; those who don&apos;t obey</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">the Son will not see life, and God&apos;s anger will rise up against them.&apos;</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="4">
			<VERS vnumber="1">The news quickly reached the Jewish religious leaders known as the Pharisees that Jesus was drawing greater crowds of followers coming to be baptized than John.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">(Although Jesus himself didn&apos;t baptize, but only his disciples.)</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Jesus</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">heard what was being said and abruptly left Judea and returned to the province of Galilee,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">and he had to pass through Samaria.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Jesus arrived at the Samaritan village of Sychar,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">near the field that Jacob had given to his son Joseph.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">She replied, &apos;Why would a Jewish man ask a Samaritan woman for a drink of water?&apos; (For Jews have no dealings with Samaritans.)</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Jesus replied,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">&apos;If you only knew who I am and the gift that God wants to give you, you&apos;d ask me for a drink, and I would give you living water.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">The woman replied, &apos;But sir,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">you don&apos;t even have a bucket, and the well is very deep. So where do you find this &apos;living water&apos;?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Do you really think that you are greater than our ancestor Jacob who dug this well and drank from it himself, along with his children and livestock?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Jesus answered,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">&apos;If you drink from Jacob&apos;s well, you&apos;ll be thirsty again,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">but if anyone drinks the living water I give them, they will never be thirsty again. For when you drink the water I give you, it becomes a gushing fountain</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">of the Holy Spirit</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">, flooding you with endless life!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">The woman replied, &apos;Let me drink that water so I&apos;ll never be thirsty again and won&apos;t have to come back here to draw water.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Jesus said,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">&apos;Go get your husband and bring him back here.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">&apos;But I&apos;m not married,&apos; the woman answered. &apos;That&apos;s true,&apos; Jesus said,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">&apos;for you&apos;ve been married five times,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">and now you&apos;re living with a man who is not your husband. You have told the truth.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">The woman changed the subject. &apos;You must be a prophet!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">So tell me this: Why do our fathers worship God on this nearby mountain,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">but your people teach that Jerusalem is the place where we must worship. Who is right?&apos; Jesus responded,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">&apos;Believe me, dear woman, the time has come when you will worship</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">the Father neither on a mountain nor in Jerusalem,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">but in your heart.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Your people don&apos;t really know the One they worship, but we Jews worship out of our experience, for it&apos;s from the Jews that salvation is available.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">The woman said, &apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">This is all so confusing</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">, but I do know that the Anointed One is coming&apos;the true Messiah. And when he comes, he will tell us everything we need to know.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">Jesus said to her,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">&apos;You don&apos;t have to wait any longer, the Anointed One is here speaking with you&apos;I am the One you&apos;re looking for.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">At that moment, his disciples returned and were stunned to see Jesus speaking with a Samaritan woman, yet none of them dared ask him why or what they were discussing.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">All at once, the woman left her water jar and ran off to her village and told everyone,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">&apos;Come and meet a man at the well who told me everything I&apos;ve ever done!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">He could be the One we&apos;ve been waiting for.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">Hearing this, the people came streaming out of the village to go see Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">Then the disciples began to insist that Jesus eat some of the food they brought back with them, saying, &apos;Teacher, you must eat something.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">But Jesus told them,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">&apos;I have eaten a meal</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">you don&apos;t know about.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">Puzzled by this, the disciples began to discuss it among themselves, &apos;Did someone already bring him food?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">To clarify, Jesus spoke up and said,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">&apos;My food is to do the will of him who sent me and bring it to completion.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">As the crowds emerged from the village, Jesus said to his disciples</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">&apos;Why would you say, &apos;The harvest is another four months away&apos;? Look at all the people coming&apos;now is harvest time! Their hearts are like vast fields of ripened grain&apos;ready for a harvest.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">Everyone who reaps these souls for eternal life will receive a reward. Both those who plant</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">spiritual</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">seeds and those who reap the</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">spiritual</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">harvest will celebrate together with great joy!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">And this confirms the saying, &apos;One sows the seed and another reaps the harvest.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">I have sent you out to harvest a field that you haven&apos;t planted, where many others have labored long and hard before you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">And now you are privileged to profit from their labors and reap the harvest.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">Many from the Samaritan village became believers in Jesus because of the woman&apos;s testimony: &apos;He told me everything I ever did!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">Then they begged Jesus to stay with them, so he stayed there for two days,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">resulting in many more coming to faith in him because of his message.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">The Samaritans said to the woman, &apos;Now we&apos;ve heard him ourselves. We no longer believe just because of what you told us, but we&apos;re convinced that he really is the true Savior of the world!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43">On the third day Jesus left there and continued his journey to Galilee,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43">where he had been raised</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43">.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44">Now Jesus knew that prophets are honored everywhere except in their own hometown.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45">Even so, as Jesus arrived in the province of Galilee, the people welcomed him with open arms. Many of them had been in Jerusalem during the Passover Festival and had witnessed firsthand the miracles he had performed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="48">So Jesus said to him,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="48">&apos;You</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="48">never believe unless you see signs and wonders.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="49">But the man continued to plead, &apos;Come with me to Capernaum before my little boy dies!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="50">Jesus looked him in the eyes and said,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="50">&apos;Go back home now. I promise you, your son will live.&apos; The man believed in his heart the words of Jesus and set off for home.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="51">When he was still a distance from Capernaum, his servants met him on the road and told him the good news, &apos;Your son is healed! He&apos;s alive!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="52">Overjoyed, the father asked his servants, &apos;When did my son begin to recover?&apos; &apos;Yesterday,&apos; they said, &apos;at one in the afternoon. All at once his fever broke&apos; and now he&apos;s well !&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="53">Then the father immediately realized that it was at that very same hour that Jesus spoke the words to him,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="53">&apos;Your son will live.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="53">From that day forward, the man, his servants, and all his family believed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="54">Healing the official&apos;s son was Jesus&apos; second extraordinary miracle in Galilee after returning from Judea.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="5">
			<VERS vnumber="1">From Galilee, Jesus returned to Jerusalem to observe one of the Jewish feasts.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Inside the city, near the Sheep Gate,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">there is</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">a pool called in Aramaic, The House of Loving Kindness,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">surrounded by five covered porches.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Hundreds of sick people were lying under the covered porches&apos;the paralyzed, the blind, and the crippled&apos;all of them waiting for their healing.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">For an angel of God periodically descended into the pool to stir the waters, and the first one who stepped into the pool after the waters swirled would instantly be healed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Among the many sick people lying there was a man who had been disabled for thirty-eight years.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">When Jesus saw him lying there, he knew that the man had been crippled for a long time.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Jesus said to him,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">&apos;Do you truly long to be well?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">The sick man answered, &apos;Sir,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">there&apos;s no way I can get healed, for I have no one to lower me into the water when the angel comes. As soon as I try to crawl to the edge of the pool, someone else jumps in ahead of me.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Jesus said to him,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">&apos;Stand up! Pick up your sleeping mat and you will walk!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Immediately he stood up&apos;he was healed! So he rolled up his mat and walked again! Now Jesus worked this miracle on the Sabbath.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">When the Jewish leaders saw the man walking along carrying his sleeping mat,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">they objected and said, &apos;What are you doing carrying that?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Don&apos;t you know it&apos;s the Sabbath?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">It&apos;s not lawful for you to carry things on the Sabbath!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">He answered them, &apos;The man who healed me told me to pick it up and walk.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">&apos;What man?&apos; they asked him. &apos;Who was this man who ordered you to carry something on a Sabbath?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">But the healed man couldn&apos;t give them an answer, for he didn&apos;t yet know who it was, since Jesus had already slipped away into the crowd.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">A short time later, Jesus found the man at the temple and said to him,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">&apos;Look at you now! You&apos;re healed! Walk away from your sin</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">so that nothing worse will happen to you.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Then the man went to the Jewish leaders to inform them, &apos;It was Jesus who healed me!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">From that day forward the Jewish leaders began to persecute Jesus because of the things he did on the Sabbath.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Jesus answered his critics by saying,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">&apos;Every day my Father is at work, and I will be, too!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">This infuriated them and made them all the more eager to devise a plan to kill him. For not only did he break their Sabbath rules,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">but he also called God</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">&apos;my Father,&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">which made him equal to God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">So Jesus said,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">&apos;I speak to you eternal truth. The Son is unable to do anything from himself or through his own initiative. I only do the works that I see the Father doing, for the Son does the same works as his Father.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">&apos;Because the Father loves his Son so much, he always reveals to him everything that he is about to do. And you will all be amazed when he shows him even greater works than what you&apos;ve seen so far!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">For just as the Father has power to raise the dead, the Son will also raise the dead and give life to whomever he wants.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">&apos;The Father judges no one, for he has given to the Son all the authority to judge.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">Therefore, the honor that belongs to the Father he will now share with his Son. So if you refuse to honor the Son, you are refusing to honor the Father who sent him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">&apos;I speak to you an eternal truth: if you embrace my message and believe in the One who sent me, you will never face condemnation. In me, you have already passed from the realm of death into eternal life!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">&apos;I speak to you an eternal truth: Soon the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God, and those who listen will arise with life!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">For as the Father is the source of life, so he has given the Son the power to impart life.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">The Father has transferred to the Son the authority to judge, because he is the Son of Man.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">&apos;Don&apos;t be amazed when I tell you these things, for there is a day coming when everyone who has ever died will hear my voice</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">calling them back to life,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">and they will come out of their graves! Those who have done what is good will experience a resurrection to eternal life. And those who have practiced evil will taste the resurrection of judgment!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">&apos;Nothing I do is from my own initiative. As I hear the judgment passed by my Father, I execute those judgments. And my judgments will be perfect, because I seek only to fulfill the desires of my Father who sent me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">If I were to make claims about myself, you would have reasons to doubt.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">But there is another</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">who bears witness on my behalf, and I know that what he testifies of me is true.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">&apos;You have sent messengers to John, and what he testified</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">about me</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">is true.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">I have no need to be validated by men, but I&apos;m explaining these things so that you will</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">believe</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">and be saved.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">&apos;John was a blazing, shining torch,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">and for a short time, you basked in his light with great joy.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">But I can provide more substantial proof of who I am that exceeds John&apos;s testimony&apos;my miracles! These works which the Father destined for me to complete&apos;they prove that the Father has sent me!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">And my Father himself, who gave me this mission, has also testified that I am his Son.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">But you have never heard his voice nor seen his form,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">nor does his Word truly live inside of you, for you refuse to believe in me or to embrace me as God&apos;s messenger.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">&apos;You are busy analyzing the Scriptures, poring over them hoping to gain eternal life. Everything you read points to me,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">yet you still refuse to come to me so I can give you the life you&apos;re looking for&apos;eternal life!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">&apos;I do not accept the honor that comes from men,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">for I know what kind of people you really are, and I can see that the love of God has found no home in you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43">I have come to represent my Father, yet you refuse to embrace me in faith. If someone comes in their own name</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43">and with their own agenda</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43">,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43">you readily accept him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44">Of course you&apos;re unable to believe in me. For you live to enjoy the praises of others and not the praise that comes from the one true God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45">&apos;I will not accuse you before the Father. The one who will incriminate you is Moses, the very one you claim to obey, the one in whom you trust!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46">If you really believed what Moses has written, then you would embrace me, for Moses wrote about me!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="47">But since you do not believe what he wrote, no wonder you don&apos;t believe what I say.&apos;</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="6">
			<VERS vnumber="1">After this Jesus went to the other side of the Lake of Tiberias,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">which is also known as Lake Galilee.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">And a massive crowd of people followed him everywhere. They were attracted by his miracles and the healings they watched him perform.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Jesus went up the slope of a hill and sat down with his disciples.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Now it was approaching the time of the Jewish celebration of Passover,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">and there were many pilgrims on their way to Jerusalem in the crowd</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">As Jesus sat down, he looked out and saw the massive crowd of people scrambling up the hill, for they wanted to be near him. So he turned to Philip and said,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">&apos;Where will we buy enough food to feed all these people?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Now Jesus already knew what he was about to do, but he said this to stretch Philip&apos;s faith.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Philip answered, &apos;Well, I suppose if we were to give everyone only a snack, it would cost thousands of dollars</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">to buy enough food!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">But just then, Andrew, Peter&apos;s brother, spoke up and said,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">&apos;Look! Here&apos;s a young person</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">with five barley loaves and two small fish . . . but how far would that go with this huge crowd?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">&apos;Have everyone sit down,&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Jesus said to his disciples. So on the vast grassy slope, more than five thousand hungry people sat down.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Jesus then took the barley loaves</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">and the fish and gave thanks to God. He then gave it to the disciples to distribute to the people. Miraculously, the food multiplied, with everyone eating as much as they wanted!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">When everyone was satisfied, Jesus told his disciples,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">&apos;Now go back and gather up the pieces left over so that nothing will be wasted.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">The disciples filled up twelve baskets of fragments,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">a basket of leftovers for each disciple</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">All the people were astounded as they saw with their own eyes the incredible miracle Jesus had performed! They began to say among themselves, &apos;He really is the One&apos;the true prophet</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">we&apos;ve been expecting!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">So Jesus, knowing that they were about to take him and make him their king by force, quickly left and went up the mountainside alone.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">By now a strong wind</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">began to blow and was stirring up the waters.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">The disciples had rowed about halfway</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">across the lake when all of a sudden they caught sight of Jesus walking on top of the waves, coming toward them. The disciples panicked,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">but Jesus called out to them,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">&apos;Don&apos;t be afraid. You know who I am.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">They were relieved to take him in, and the moment Jesus stepped into the boat, they were instantly transported to the other side!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">So when the people saw on the shoreline a number of small boats from Tiberias and realized Jesus and the disciples weren&apos;t there, they got into the boats and went to Capernaum to search for him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">When they finally found him, they asked him, &apos;Teacher, how did you get here?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">Jesus replied,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">&apos;Let me make this very clear,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">you came looking for me because I fed you by a miracle, not because you believe in me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">Why would you strive for food that is perishable and not be passionate to seek the food of eternal life, which never spoils?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">I, the Son of Man, am ready to give you what matters most, for God the Father has destined me for this purpose.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">They replied, &apos;So what should we do if we want to do God&apos;s work?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">Jesus answered,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">&apos;The work you can do for God starts with believing in the One he has sent.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">&apos;The truth is,&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">Jesus said,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">&apos;Moses didn&apos;t give you the bread of heaven. It&apos;s my Father who offers bread that comes as a dramatic sign</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">from heaven.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">The bread of God is the One who came out of heaven to give his life to feed the world.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">&apos;Then please, sir, give us this bread every day,&apos; they replied.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">Jesus said to them,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">&apos;I am the Bread of Life.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">Come every day to me and you will never be hungry. Believe in me and you will never be thirsty.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">Yet I&apos;ve told you that even though you&apos;ve seen me, you still don&apos;t believe in me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">But everyone my Father has given to me, they will come. And all who come to me, I will embrace and will never turn them away.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">And I have come out of heaven not for my own desires, but for the satisfaction</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">of my Father who sent me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">My Father who sent me has determined that I will not lose even one of those he has given to me, and I will raise them up in the last day.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">For the longing of my Father is that everyone who embraces the Son</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">and believes in him will experience eternal life and I will raise them up in the last day!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">When the Jews who were hostile to Jesus heard him say,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">&apos;I am the Bread that came down from heaven,&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">they immediately began to complain,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">&apos;How can he say these things about himself? We know him, and we know his parents. How dare he say, &apos;I have come down from heaven?&apos; &apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43">Jesus responded,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43">&apos;Stop your grumbling!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44">The only way people come to me is by the Father who sent me&apos;he pulls</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44">on their hearts to embrace me. And those who are drawn to me, I will certainly raise them up in the last day.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45">Jesus continued,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45">&apos;It has been written by the prophets, &apos;They will all be taught by God himself.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45">If you are really listening to the Father and learning directly from him, you will come to me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46">For I am the only One who has come from the Father&apos;s side, and I have seen the Father!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="47">&apos;I speak to you living truth: Unite your heart to me and believe&apos;and you will experience eternal life!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="48">I am the true Bread of Life.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="49">Your ancestors ate manna in the desert and died.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="50">But standing here before you is the true Bread that comes out of heaven, and when you eat this Bread you will never die.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="51">I alone am this living Bread that has come to you from heaven. Eat this Bread and you will live forever. The living Bread I give you is my body, which I will offer as a sacrifice so that all may live.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="52">These words of Jesus sparked an angry outburst among the Jews. They protested, saying, &apos;Does this man expect us to eat his body?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="53">Jesus replied to them,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="53">&apos;Listen to this eternal truth: Unless you eat the body of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you will not have eternal life.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="54">Eternal life comes to the one who eats my body</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="54">and drinks my blood, and I will raise him up in the last day.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="55">For my body is real food for your spirit and my blood is real drink.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="56">The one who eats my body and drinks my blood lives in me and I live in him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="57">The Father of life sent me, and he is my life. In the same way, the one who feeds upon me, I will become his life.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="58">I am not like the bread your ancestors ate and later died. I am the living Bread that comes from heaven. Eat this Bread and you will live forever!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="59">Jesus preached this sermon in the synagogue in Capernaum.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="60">And when many of Jesus&apos; followers heard these things, it caused a stir. &apos;That&apos;s disgusting!&apos; they said. &apos;How could anybody accept it?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="61">Without anyone telling him, Jesus knew they were outraged and told them,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="61">&apos;Are you offended over my teaching?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="62">What will you do when you see the Son of Man ascending</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="62">into the realm</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="62">from where he came?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="63">&apos;The Holy Spirit is the one who gives life, that which is of the natural realm</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="63">is of no help. The words I speak to you are Spirit and life. But there are still some of you who won&apos;t believe.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="64">In fact, Jesus already knew from the beginning who the skeptics were and who his traitor would be.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="65">He went on to say,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="65">&apos;This is why I told you that no one embraces me unless the Father has given you to me.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="66">And so from that time on many of the disciples turned their backs on Jesus and refused to be associated with him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="67">So Jesus said to his twelve,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="67">&apos;And you&apos;do you also want to leave?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="68">Peter spoke up and said, &apos;But Lord, where would we go? No one but you gives us the revelation of eternal life.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="69">We&apos;re fully convinced that you are the Anointed One, the Son of the Living God,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="69">and we believe in you!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="70">Then Jesus</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="70">shocked them</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="70">with these words:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="70">&apos;I have hand-picked you to be my twelve, knowing that one of you is the devil.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="71">Jesus was referring to Judas Iscariot,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="71">son of Simon, for he knew that Judas, one of his chosen disciples, was getting ready to betray him.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="7">
			<VERS vnumber="1">After this Jesus traveled extensively throughout the province of Galilee, but he avoided the province of Judea, for he knew the Jewish leaders in Jerusalem were plotting to have him killed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Now the annual Feast of Tabernacles</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">was approaching.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">So Jesus&apos; brothers</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">came to advise him, saying, &apos;Why don&apos;t you leave the countryside villages and go to Judea where the crowds are,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">so that your followers can see your miracles?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">No one can see what you&apos;re doing here in the backwoods of Galilee. How do you expect to be successful and famous if you do all these things in secret? Now is your time&apos;go to Jerusalem, come out of hiding, and show the world who you are!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">His brothers were pushing him, even though they didn&apos;t yet believe in him as the Savior.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Jesus responded,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">&apos;My time of being unveiled hasn&apos;t yet come, but any time is a suitable opportunity for you</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">to gain man&apos;s approval.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">The world can&apos;t hate you, but it does me, for I am exposing their evil deeds.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">You can go ahead and celebrate the feast without me&apos;my appointed time has not yet come.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">During the feast, the Jewish leaders kept looking for Jesus and asking around, &apos;Where is he? Have you seen him?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">A controversy was brewing among the people, with so many differing opinions about Jesus. Some were saying, &apos;He&apos;s a good man!&apos; While others weren&apos;t convinced and insisted, saying, &apos;He&apos;s just a demagogue.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Yet no one was bold enough to speak out publicly on Jesus&apos; behalf for fear of the Jewish leaders.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Not until the feast was half over did Jesus finally appear in the temple courts and begin to teach.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">The Jewish leaders were astonished by what he taught and said, &apos;How did this man acquire such knowledge? He wasn&apos;t trained in our schools&apos;who taught him?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">So Jesus responded,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">&apos;I don&apos;t teach my own ideas,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">but the truth revealed to me by the One who sent me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">If you want to test my teachings and discover where I received them, first be passionate to do God&apos;s will,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">and then you will be able to discern if my teachings are from the heart of God or from my own opinions.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Charlatans praise themselves and seek honor from men, but my Father sent me to speak truth on his behalf. And I have no false motive, because I seek only the glory of God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Moses has given you the law, but not one of you is faithful to keep it. So if you are all law-breakers, why then would you seek to kill me?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Then some in the crowd shouted out, &apos;You must be out of your mind!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Who&apos;s trying to kill you?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Jesus replied,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">&apos;I only had to do one miracle,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">and all of you marvel!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Yet isn&apos;t it true that Moses and your forefathers</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">ordered you to circumcise your sons even if the eighth day fell on a Sabbath?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">So if you cut away part of a man on the Sabbath and that doesn&apos;t break the Jewish law,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">why then would you be indignant with me for making a man completely healed on the Sabbath?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">Stop judging based on the superficial.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">First you must</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">embrace the standards of mercy</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">and truth.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">Then some of the residents of Jerusalem spoke up and said, &apos;Isn&apos;t this the one they&apos;re trying to kill?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">So why is he here speaking publicly and not one of the Jewish leaders is doing anything about it? Are they starting to think that he&apos;s the Anointed One?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">But how could he be, since we know this man is from Galilee, but no one will know where the true Messiah comes from, he&apos;ll just appear out of nowhere.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">Knowing all of this, Jesus one day preached</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">boldly</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">in the temple courts,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">&apos;So, you think you know me and where I come from? But you don&apos;t know the One who sent me&apos;the Father who is always faithful.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">I have not come simply on my own initiative.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">The Father has sent me here, and I know all about him, for I have come from his presence.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">His words caused many to want to arrest him, but no man was able to lay a hand on him, for it wasn&apos;t yet his appointed time.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">And there were many people who thought he might be the Messiah. They said, &apos;After all, when the Anointed One appears, could he possibly do more signs and wonders than this man has done?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">So when the Pharisees</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">heard these rumors circulating about Jesus, they went with the leading priests and the temple guards to arrest him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">Then Jesus said,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">&apos;My days to be with you are numbered. Then I will return to the One who sent me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">And you will search for me and not be able to find me. For where I am,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">you cannot come.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">When the Jewish leaders heard this, they discussed among themselves, &apos;Where could he possibly go that we won&apos;t be able to find him? Is he going to minister in a different land where our people live scattered among the nations? Is he going to teach those who are not Jews?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">What did he really mean by his statement, &apos;You will search for me and won&apos;t be able to find me. And where I am you can&apos;t come&apos;?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">Then on the most important day of the feast, the last day,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">Jesus stood and shouted out to the crowds&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">&apos;All you thirsty ones, come to me! Come to me and drink!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">Believe in me so that rivers of living water will burst out from within you, flowing</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">from your innermost being, just like the Scripture says!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">Jesus was prophesying about the Holy Spirit that believers were being prepared to receive.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">But the Holy Spirit had not yet been poured out upon them, because Jesus had not yet been unveiled in his full splendor.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">When the crowd heard Jesus&apos; words, some said, &apos;This man really is a prophet!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">Others said, &apos;He&apos;s the Messiah!&apos; But others said, &apos;How could he be the Anointed One since he&apos;s from Galilee?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">Don&apos;t the Scriptures say that he will be one of David&apos;s descendants and be born in Bethlehem, the city of David?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43">So the crowd was divided over Jesus,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44">some wanted him arrested but no one dared to lay a hand on him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45">So when the temple guards returned to the Pharisees and the leading priests without Jesus, they were questioned, &apos;Where is he? Why didn&apos;t you bring that man back with you?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46">They answered, &apos;You don&apos;t understand&apos;he speaks amazing things like no one else has ever spoken!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="47">The religious leaders mocked, &apos;Oh, so now you also have been led astray by him?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="48">Do you see even one of us, your leaders, following him?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="49">This ignorant rabble swarms around him because none of them know anything about the Law! They&apos;re all cursed!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="50">Just then, Nicodemus, who had secretly spent time with Jesus, spoke up, for he was a respected voice among them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="51">He cautioned them, saying, &apos;Does our law decide a man&apos;s guilt before we first hear him and allow him to defend himself?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="52">They argued, &apos;Oh, so now you&apos;re an advocate for this Galilean! Search the Scriptures, Nicodemus, and you&apos;ll see that there&apos;s no mention of a prophet coming out of Galilee!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="52">So with that their debate ended</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="52">,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="53">and they each went their own way.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="8">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Jesus walked up the Mount of Olives</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">near the city</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">where he spent the night</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Then at dawn Jesus appeared in the temple courts again, and soon all the people gathered around to listen to his words, so he sat down and taught them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Then in the middle of his teaching, the religious scholars</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">and the Pharisees broke through the crowd and brought a woman who had been caught in the act of committing adultery and made her stand</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">in the middle</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">of everyone.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Then they said to Jesus, &apos;Teacher, we caught this woman in the very act of adultery.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Doesn&apos;t Moses&apos; law command us to stone to death a woman like this?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Tell us, what do you say we should do with her?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">They were only testing Jesus because they hoped to trap him with his own words and accuse him</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">of breaking the laws of Moses</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">. But Jesus didn&apos;t answer them. Instead he simply bent down and wrote in the dust with his finger.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Angry, they kept insisting</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">that he answer their question, so Jesus stood up and looked at them and said,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">&apos;Let&apos;s have the man who has never had a sinful desire</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">throw the first stone at her.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">And then he bent over again and wrote some more words in the dust.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Upon hearing that, her accusers slowly left the crowd one at a time, beginning with the oldest to the youngest,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">with a convicted conscience.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Until finally, Jesus was left alone with the woman still standing there in front of him. So he stood back up and said to her,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">&apos;Dear woman, where are your accusers? Is there no one here to condemn you?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Looking around, she replied, &apos;I see no one, Lord.&apos; Jesus said, &apos;Then I certainly don&apos;t condemn you either. Go, and from now on, be free from a life of sin.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Then Jesus said,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">&apos;I am</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">light to the world, and those who embrace me will experience life-giving light, and they will never</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">walk</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">in darkness.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">The Pharisees were immediately offended and said, &apos;You&apos;re just boasting about yourself! Since we only have your word on this, it makes your testimony invalid!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Jesus responded,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">&apos;Just because I am the one making these claims doesn&apos;t mean they&apos;re invalid.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">For I absolutely know who I am</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">, where I&apos;ve come from, and where I&apos;m going. But you Pharisees have no idea about what I&apos;m saying.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">For you&apos;ve set yourselves up as judges of others based on outward appearances, but I certainly never judge others in that way.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">For I discern the truth. And I am not alone in my judgments, for my Father and I have the same understanding in all things, and he has sent me to you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">&apos;Isn&apos;t it written in the law of Moses that the testimony of two men is trustworthy?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Then what I say about who I am is true, for I am not alone in my testimony&apos;my Father is the other witness, and we testify together of the truth.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Then they asked, &apos;Just who is this &apos;Father&apos; of yours? Where is he?&apos; Jesus answered, &apos;You wouldn&apos;t ask that question if you knew who I am, or my Father. For if you knew me, you would recognize my Father too.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">(Jesus taught all these things while standing</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">in the treasure room of the temple</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">And no one dared to arrest him, for it wasn&apos;t yet his time to surrender to men.)</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">One day Jesus said again,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">&apos;I am about to leave you. You will want to find me, but you will still die in your sins.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">You won&apos;t be able to come where I am going.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">This so confused the Jewish leaders that they began to say, &apos;Is he planning to commit suicide? What&apos;s he talking about&apos;&apos;You won&apos;t be able to come where I am going&apos;?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">Jesus spoke up and said,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">&apos;You are all from the earth; I am from above. I am not from this world like you are.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">That&apos;s why I&apos;ve told you that you will all die in your sins if you fail to believe that I AM who I AM.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">So they asked him plainly, &apos;Who are you?&apos; &apos;I am the One I&apos;ve always claimed to be.&apos; Jesus replied.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">&apos;And I still have many more things to pronounce in judgment about you. For I will testify to the world of the truths that I have heard from my Father, and the Father who sent me is trustworthy.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">(Even after all of this, they still didn&apos;t realize that he was speaking about his heavenly Father.)</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">&apos;You will know me as &apos;I AM&apos; after you have lifted me up from the earth</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">as the Son of Man. Then you will realize that I do nothing on my own initiative, but I only speak the truth that the Father has revealed to me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">I am his messenger and he is always with me, for I only do that which delights his heart.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">These words caused many</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">respected Jews</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">to believe in him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">Jesus said to those Jews who believed in him,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">&apos;When you continue to embrace all that I teach, you prove that you are my true followers.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">For if you embrace the truth, it will release true freedom into your lives.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">Surprised by this, they said, &apos;But we&apos;re the descendants of Abraham and we&apos;re already free. We&apos;ve never been in bondage</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">to anyone. How could you say that we will be released into more freedom?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">&apos;I speak eternal truth,&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">Jesus said.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">&apos;When you sin you are not free. You&apos;ve become a slave in bondage to your sin.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">And slaves have no permanent standing in a family, like a son does, for a son is a part of the family forever.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">So if the Son sets you free from sin, then become a true son and be unquestionably free!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">Even though you are descendants of Abraham, you desire to kill me because the message I bring has not found a home in your hearts.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">Yet the truths I speak I&apos;ve seen and received in my Father&apos;s presence. But you are doing what you&apos;ve learned from your father!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">&apos;What do you mean?&apos; they replied. &apos;Abraham is our father!&apos; Jesus said, &apos;If you are really Abraham&apos;s sons, then you would follow in the steps of Abraham.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">I&apos;ve only told you the truth that I&apos;ve heard in my Father&apos;s presence, but now you are wanting me dead&apos;is that how Abraham acted?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">No, you people are doing what your father has taught you!&apos; Indignant, they responded, &apos;What are you talking about? We only have one Father, God himself! We&apos;re not illegitimate!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">Jesus said,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">&apos;Then if God were really your father, you would love me, for I&apos;ve come from his presence. I didn&apos;t come here on my own, but God sent me to you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43">Why don&apos;t you understand what I say?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43">You don&apos;t understand because your hearts are closed to my message!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44">&apos;You are the offspring of your father, the devil,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44">and you serve your father very well, passionately carrying out his desires. He&apos;s been a murderer right from the start! He never stood with the truth, for he&apos;s full of nothing but lies&apos;lying is his native tongue.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44">He is a master of deception and the father of lies!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45">But I am the true Prince who speaks nothing but the truth, yet you refuse to believe and you want nothing to do with me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46">Can you name one sin that I&apos;ve committed? Then if I am telling you only the truth, why don&apos;t you believe me?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="47">If you really knew God, you would listen, receive, and respond with faith to his words. But since you don&apos;t listen and respond to what he says, it proves you don&apos;t belong to him and you have no room for him in your hearts.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="48">&apos;See! We were right all along!&apos; some of the Jewish leaders shouted. &apos;You&apos;re nothing but a demon-possessed Samaritan!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="49">Jesus replied,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="49">&apos;It is not a demon that would cause me to honor my Father. I live my life for his honor, even though you insult me for it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="50">I never have a need to seek my own glory, for the Father will do that for me, and he will judge those who do not.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="51">I speak to you this eternal truth: whoever cherishes my words and keeps them will never experience death.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="52">This prompted the Jewish leaders to say, &apos;Now we know for sure that you&apos;re demon possessed! You just said that those who keep watch over your words will never experience death, but Abraham and all the prophets have died!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="53">Do you think you&apos;re greater than our father Abraham and all the prophets? You are so delusional about yourself that you make yourself greater than you are!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="54">Jesus answered them,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="54">&apos;If I were to tell you how great I am, it would mean nothing. But my Father is the One who will prove it and will glorify me. Isn&apos;t he the One you claim is your God?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="55">But in reality, you&apos;ve never embraced him as your own. I know him, and I would be a liar, like yourselves, if I told you anything less than that. I have fully embraced him, and I treasure his every word.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="56">And not only that, Abraham, your ancestor, was overjoyed when he received the revelation of my coming to earth. Yes, he foresaw me coming and was filled with delight!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="57">But many of the Jewish leaders doubted him and said, &apos;What are you talking about? You&apos;re not even fifty years old yet. You talk like you&apos;ve seen Abraham!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="58">Jesus said to them,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="58">&apos;I give you this eternal truth: I have existed long before Abraham was born, for I AM!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="59">When they heard this, they picked up rocks to stone him, but Jesus concealed himself as he passed through the crowd</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="59">and went away from there.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="9">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Afterward, as Jesus walked down the street, he noticed a man blind from birth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">His disciples asked him, &apos;Teacher, whose sin caused this guy&apos;s blindness, his own, or the sin of his parents?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Jesus answered,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">&apos;Neither. It happened to him so that you could watch him experience God&apos;s miracle.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">While I am with you, it is daytime and we must do the works of God who sent me while the light shines.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">For there is coming a dark night when no one will be able to work.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">As long as I am with you my life is the light that pierces the world&apos;s darkness.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Then Jesus spat on the ground and made some clay with his saliva.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Then he anointed the blind man&apos;s eyes with the clay.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">And he said to the blind man,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">&apos;Now go and wash the clay from your eyes in the ritual pool of Siloam.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">So he went and washed his face and as he came back, he could see for the first time in his life!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">This caused quite a stir among the people of the neighborhood, for they noticed the blind beggar was now seeing! They began to say to one another, &apos;Isn&apos;t this the blind man who once sat and begged?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Some said, &apos;No, it can&apos;t be him!&apos; Others said, &apos;But it looks just like him&apos;it has to be him!&apos; All the while the man kept insisting, &apos;I&apos;m the man who was blind!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Finally, they asked him, &apos;What has happened to you?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">He replied, &apos;I met the man named Jesus! He rubbed clay on my eyes and said, &apos;Go to the pool named Siloam and wash.&apos; So I went and while I was washing the clay from my eyes I began to see</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">for the very first time ever!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">So the people of the neighborhood inquired, &apos;Where is this man?&apos; &apos;I have no idea.&apos; the man replied.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">So the people marched him over to the Pharisees to speak with them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">They were concerned because the miracle Jesus performed by making clay with his saliva and anointing the man&apos;s eyes happened on a Sabbath day, a day that no one was allowed to &apos;work.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Then the Pharisees asked the man, &apos;How did you have your sight restored?&apos; He replied, &apos;A man anointed my eyes with clay, then I washed, and now I can see for the first time in my life!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Then an argument broke out among the Pharisees over the healing of the blind man on the Sabbath. Some said, &apos;This man who performed this healing is clearly not from God! He doesn&apos;t even observe the Sabbath!&apos; Others said, &apos;If Jesus is just an ordinary sinner,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">how could he perform a miracle like that?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">This prompted them to turn on the man healed of blindness, putting him on the spot in front of them all, demanding an answer. They asked, &apos;Who do you say he is&apos;this man who opened your blind eyes?&apos; &apos;He&apos;s a prophet of God!&apos; the man replied.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Still refusing to believe that the man had been healed and was truly blind from birth, the Jewish leaders called for the man&apos;s parents to be brought to them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">&apos;We have no idea,&apos; they answered. &apos;We don&apos;t know what happened to our son. Ask him, he&apos;s a mature adult. He can speak for himself.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">(Now the parents were obviously intimidated by the Jewish religious leaders, for they had already announced to the people that if anyone publicly confessed Jesus as the Messiah, they would be excommunicated.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">That&apos;s why they told them, &apos;Ask him, he&apos;s a mature adult. He can speak for himself.&apos;)</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">So once again they summoned the man who was healed of blindness and said to him, &apos;Swear to God to tell us the truth!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">We know the man who healed you is a sinful man! Do you agree?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">The healed man replied, &apos;I have no idea what kind of man he is. All I know is that I was blind and now I can see for the first time in my life!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">&apos;But what did he do to you?&apos; they asked. &apos;How did he heal you?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">The man responded, &apos;I told you once and you didn&apos;t listen to me. Why do you make me repeat it? Are you wanting to be his followers too?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">This angered the Jewish leaders. They heaped insults on him, &apos;We can tell you are one of his followers&apos;now we know it! We are true followers of Moses,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">for we know that God spoke to Moses directly. But as for this one, we don&apos;t know where he&apos;s coming from!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">&apos;Well, what a surprise this is!&apos; the man said. &apos;You don&apos;t even know where he comes from, but he healed my eyes and now I can see!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">We know that God doesn&apos;t listen to sinners, but only to godly people who do his will.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">Yet who has ever heard of a man born blind that was healed and given his eyesight for the very first time?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">I tell you, if this man isn&apos;t from God, he wouldn&apos;t be able to heal me like he has!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">Some of the Jewish leaders were enraged and said, &apos;Just who do you think you are to lecture us! You were born a blind, filthy sinner!&apos; So they threw the man out in the street.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">When Jesus learned they had thrown him out, he went to find him and said to him,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">&apos;Do you believe in the Son of God?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">The man whose blind eyes were healed answered, &apos;Who is he, Master? Tell me so that I can place all my faith in him.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">Jesus replied,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">&apos;You&apos;re looking right at him. He&apos;s speaking with you. It&apos;s me, the one in front of you now.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">Then the man threw himself at his feet and worshiped Jesus and said, &apos;Lord, I believe in you!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">And Jesus said,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">&apos;I have come to judge those who think they see and make them blind. And for those who are blind, I have come to make them see.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">Some of the Pharisees were standing nearby and overheard these words. They interrupted Jesus and said, &apos;You mean to tell us that we are blind?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">Jesus told them,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">&apos;If you would acknowledge your blindness, then your sin would be removed. But now that you claim to see, your sin remains with you!&apos;</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="10">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Jesus said to the Pharisees</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">&apos;Listen to this eternal truth: The person who sneaks over the wall to enter into the sheep pen, rather than coming through the gate, reveals himself as a thief coming to steal.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">But the true Shepherd walks right up to the gate,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">and because the gatekeeper knows who he is, he opens the gate to let him in.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">And the sheep recognize the voice of the true Shepherd, for he calls his own by name and leads them out, for they belong to him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">And when he has brought out all his sheep, he walks ahead of them and they will follow him, for they are familiar with his voice.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">But they will run away from strangers and never follow them because they know it&apos;s the voice of a stranger.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Jesus told the Pharisees this parable even though they didn&apos;t understand a word of what he meant.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">So Jesus went over it again,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">&apos;I speak to you eternal truth: I am the Gate for the flock.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">All those who broke in before me are thieves who came to steal,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">but the sheep never listened to them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">I am the Gateway.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">To enter through me is to experience life, freedom, and satisfaction.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">A thief has only one thing in mind&apos;he wants to steal, slaughter,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">and destroy. But I have come to</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">give you everything in abundance,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">more than you expect</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">&apos;life in its fullness until you overflow!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">I am the Good</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Shepherd who lays down my life as a sacrifice for the sheep.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">&apos;I alone am the Good Shepherd, and I know those whose hearts are mine, for they recognize me and know me,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">just as my Father knows my heart and I know my Father&apos;s heart. I am ready to give my life for the sheep.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">&apos;And I have other sheep that I will gather which are not of this Jewish flock. And I, their shepherd, must lead them too, and they will follow me and listen to my voice. And I will join them all into one flock with one shepherd.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">&apos;The Father has an intense love for me because I freely give my own life&apos;to raise it up again.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">I surrender my own life, and no one has the power to take my life from me. I have the authority to lay it down and the power to take it back again. This is the destiny my Father has set before me.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">This teaching set off another heated controversy among the Jewish leaders.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Many of them said, &apos;This man is a demon-possessed lunatic! Why would anyone listen to a word he says?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">But then there were others who weren&apos;t so sure: &apos;His teaching is full of insight. These are not the ravings of a madman! How could a demonized man give sight to one born blind?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">when the Jewish leaders encircled him and said, &apos;How much longer will you keep us in suspense? Tell us the truth and clarify this for us once and for all. Are you really the Messiah, the Anointed One?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">Jesus answered them,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">&apos;I have told you the truth already and you did not believe me. The proof of who I am is revealed by all the miracles that I do in the name of my Father.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">Yet, you stubbornly refuse to follow me, because you are not my sheep. As I&apos;ve told you before:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">My own sheep will hear my voice and I know each one, and they will follow me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">I give to them the gift of eternal life and they will never be lost and no one has the power to snatch them out of my hands.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">My Father, who has given them to me as his gift, is the mightiest of all, and no one has the power to snatch them from my Father&apos;s care.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">The Father and I are one.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">When they heard this, the Jewish leaders were so enraged that they picked up rocks to stone him to death.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">But Jesus said,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">&apos;My Father has empowered me to work many miracles and acts of mercy among you. So which one of them do you want to stone me for?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">The Jewish leaders responded, &apos;We&apos;re not stoning you for anything good you did&apos;it&apos;s because of your blasphemy! You&apos;re just</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">a son of Adam</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">, but you&apos;ve claimed to be God!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">Jesus answered,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">&apos;Isn&apos;t it written in your Scriptures that God said, &apos;You are gods?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">The Scriptures cannot be denied or found to be in error.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">So if those who have the message of the Scriptures are said to be &apos;gods,&apos; then why would you accuse me of blasphemy?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">For I have been uniquely chosen by God and he is the one who sent me to you. How then could it be blasphemy for me to say, &apos;I am the Son of God!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">If I&apos;m not doing the beautiful works that my Father sent me to do, then don&apos;t believe me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">But if you see me doing the beautiful works of God upon the earth, then you should at least believe the evidence of the miracles, even if you don&apos;t believe my words! Then you would come to experience me and be convinced that I am in the Father and the Father is in me.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">Once again they attempted to seize him, but he escaped</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">miraculously</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">from their clutches.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">Then Jesus went back to the place where John had baptized him at the crossing of the Jordan.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">Many came out to where he was and said about him, &apos;Even though John didn&apos;t perform any miracles, everything he predicted about this man is true!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">And many people became followers of Jesus at the Jordan and believed in him.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="11">
			<VERS vnumber="3">So his sisters sent</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">a message</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">to Jesus, &apos;Lord, our brother Lazarus, the one you love, is very sick. Please come!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">When he heard this, he said,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">&apos;This sickness will not end in death for Lazarus, but will bring glory and praise to God. This will reveal the greatness of the Son of God by what takes place.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Finally, on the third day, he said to his disciples,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">&apos;Come. It&apos;s time to go to Bethany.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">&apos;But Teacher,&apos; they said to him, &apos;do you really want to go back there? It was just a short time ago the people of Judea were going to stone you!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Then Jesus added,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">&apos;Lazarus, our friend, has just fallen asleep.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">It&apos;s time that I go and awaken him.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">When they heard this, the disciples replied, &apos;Lord, if he has just fallen asleep, then he&apos;ll get better.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Jesus was speaking about Lazarus&apos; death, but the disciples presumed he was talking about natural sleep.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Then Jesus made it plain to them,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">&apos;Lazarus is dead.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">And for your sake, I&apos;m glad I wasn&apos;t there,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">because now you have another opportunity to see who I am</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">so that you will learn to trust in me. Come, let&apos;s go and see him.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">So Thomas, nicknamed the Twin, remarked to the other disciples, &apos;Let&apos;s go so that we can die with him.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Many friends</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">of Mary and Martha had come from the region to console them over the loss of their brother.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">And when Martha heard that Jesus was approaching the village, she went out to meet him, but Mary stayed in the house.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Martha said to Jesus, &apos;My Lord, if only you had come sooner, my brother wouldn&apos;t have died.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">But I know that if you were to ask God for anything, he would do it for you.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">Jesus told her,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">&apos;Your brother will rise and live.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">She replied, &apos;Yes, I know he will rise with everyone else on resurrection day.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">&apos;Martha,&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">Jesus said,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">You don&apos;t have to wait until then.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">I am</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">the Resurrection,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">and I am Life Eternal. Anyone who clings to me in faith, even though he dies, will live forever.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">And the one who lives by believing in me will never die.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">Do you believe this?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">Then Martha replied, &apos;Yes, Lord, I do! I&apos;ve always believed that you are the Anointed One, the Son of God who has come into the world for us!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">Then she left and hurried off to her sister, Mary, and called her aside from all the mourners and whispered to her, &apos;The Master is here and he&apos;s asking for you.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">So when Mary heard this, she quickly went off to find him,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">for Jesus was lingering outside the village at the same spot where Martha met him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">Now when Mary&apos;s friends who were comforting her</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">noticed how quickly she ran out of the house, they followed her, assuming she was going to the tomb of her brother to mourn.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">When Mary finally found Jesus outside the village, she fell at his feet in tears and said, &apos;Lord, if only you had been here, my brother would not have died.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">When Jesus looked at Mary and saw her weeping at his feet, and all her friends who were with her grieving, he shuddered with emotion</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">and was deeply moved with tenderness and compassion.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">He said to them,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">&apos;Where did you bury him?&apos; &apos;Lord, come with us and we&apos;ll show you,&apos; they replied.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">Then tears streamed down Jesus&apos; face.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">Seeing Jesus weep caused many of the mourners to say, &apos;Look how much he loved Lazarus.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">Yet others said, &apos;Isn&apos;t this the One who opens blind eyes? Why didn&apos;t he do something to keep Lazarus from dying?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">Then Jesus, with intense emotions, came to the tomb&apos;a cave with a stone placed over its entrance.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">Jesus told them,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">&apos;Roll away the stone.&apos; Then Martha said, &apos;But Lord, it&apos;s been four days since he died&apos;by now his body is already decomposing!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">Jesus looked at her and said,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">&apos;Didn&apos;t I tell you that if you will believe in me, you will see God unveil his power?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">So they rolled away the heavy stone. Jesus gazed into heaven and said,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">&apos;Father, thank you</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">that you have heard my prayer,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">for you listen to every word I speak. Now, so that these who stand here with me will believe that you have sent me to the earth as your messenger,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">I will use the power you have given me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43">Then with a loud voice Jesus shouted with authority:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43">&apos;Lazarus! Come out of the tomb!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44">Then in front of everyone, Lazarus, who had died four days earlier, slowly hobbled out&apos;he still had grave clothes tightly wrapped around his hands and feet and covering his face! Jesus said to them,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44">&apos;Unwrap him and let him loose.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45">From that day forward many of those</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45">who had come to visit Mary believed in him, for they had seen with their own eyes this amazing miracle!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46">But a few went back to inform the Pharisees about what Jesus had done.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="47">So the Pharisees and the chief priests called a special meeting of the High Council</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="47">and said, &apos;So what are we going to do about this man? Look at all the great miracles he&apos;s performing!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="48">If we allow him to continue like this, everyone will believe in him. And the Romans will take action and destroy both our country and our people!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="49">Now Caiaphas, the high priest that year, spoke up and said, &apos;You don&apos;t understand a thing!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="50">Don&apos;t you realize we&apos;d be much better off if this one man were to die for the people than for the whole nation to perish?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="51">(This prophecy that Jesus was destined to die</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="51">for the Jewish people didn&apos;t come from Caiaphas himself,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="51">but he was moved by God</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="51">to prophesy as the chief priest.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="52">And Jesus&apos; death would not be for the Jewish people only, but to gather together God&apos;s children scattered around the world and unite them as one.)</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="53">So from that day on, they were committed to killing Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="54">For this reason Jesus no longer went out in public among the Jews. But he went in the wilderness to a village called Ephraim,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="54">where he secluded himself with his disciples.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="55">Now the time came for the Passover preparations, and many from the countryside went to Jerusalem for their ceremonial cleansing before the feast began.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="56">And all the people kept looking out for Jesus, expecting him to come to the city. They said to themselves while they waited in the temple courts, &apos;Do you think that he will dare come to the feast?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="57">For the leading priests and the Pharisees had given orders that they be informed immediately if anyone saw Jesus, so they could seize and arrest him.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="12">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Six days before the Passover began, Jesus went back to Bethany, the town where he raised Lazarus from the dead.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">They had prepared a supper for Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Martha served, and Lazarus and Mary were among those at the table.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Mary picked up an alabaster</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">jar filled with nearly a liter</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">of extremely rare and costly perfume&apos;the purest extract of nard,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">and she anointed Jesus&apos; feet. Then she wiped them dry with her long hair. And the fragrance of the costly oil filled the house.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">But Judas the locksmith,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Simon&apos;s son, the betrayer, spoke up and said,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">&apos;What a waste! We could have sold this perfume for a fortune</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">and given the money to the poor!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">(In fact, Judas had no heart for the poor. He only said this because he was a thief and in charge of the money case. He would steal money whenever he wanted from the funds</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">given to support Jesus&apos; ministry</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">.)</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Jesus said to Judas,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">&apos;Leave her alone! She has saved it for the time of my burial.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">You&apos;ll always have the poor with you;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">but you won&apos;t always have me.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">When the word got out that Jesus was not far from Jerusalem, a large crowd came out to see him, and they also wanted to see Lazarus, the man Jesus had raised from the dead.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">This prompted the chief priests to seal their plans to do away with both Jesus and Lazarus,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">for his miracle testimony was irrefutable and was persuading many of the Jews living in Jerusalem to believe in Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">The next day the news that Jesus was on his way to Jerusalem swept through the massive crowd gathered for the feast.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">So they took palm branches</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">and went out to meet him. Everyone was shouting, &apos;Lord, be our Savior!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Blessed is the one who comes to us sent from Yahweh,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">the King of Israel!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Then Jesus found a young donkey and rode on it to fulfill what was prophesied:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">&apos;People of Zion,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">have no fear! Look&apos;it&apos;s your king coming to you riding on a young donkey!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Now Jesus&apos; disciples didn&apos;t fully understand the importance of what was taking place, but after he was raised and exalted into glory, they understood how Jesus fulfilled all the prophecies in the Scriptures that were written about him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">All the eyewitnesses of the miracle Jesus performed when he called Lazarus out of the tomb and raised him from the dead kept spreading the news about Jesus to everyone.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">The news of this miracle of resurrection caused the crowds to swell as great numbers of people</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">welcomed him into the city with joy</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">But the Pharisees were disturbed by this and said to each other, &apos;We won&apos;t be able to stop this.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">The whole world is going to run after him!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Now there were a number of foreigners from among the nations who were worshipers at the feast.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">They went to Philip (who came from the village of Bethsaida in Galilee) and they asked him, &apos;Would you take us to see Jesus? We want to see him.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">So Philip went to find Andrew, and then they both went to inform Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">He replied to them,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">&apos;Now is the time for the Son of Man to be glorified.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">Let me make this clear:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">A single grain of wheat will never be more than a single grain of wheat unless it drops into the ground and dies. Because then it sprouts and produces</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">a great harvest of wheat&apos;all because one grain</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">died.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">&apos;The person who loves his life and pampers himself will miss true life! But the one who detaches his life from this world and abandons himself to me, will find true life and enjoy it forever!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">If you want to be my disciple, follow me and you will go where I am going.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">And if you truly follow me as my disciple,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">the Father will shower his favor upon your life.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">&apos;Even though I am torn within, and my soul is in turmoil, I will not ask the Father to rescue me from this hour of trial. For I have come to fulfill my purpose</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">to offer myself to God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">So, Father, bring glory to your name!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">Then suddenly a booming voice was heard from the sky, &apos;I have glorified my name! And I will glorify it through you again!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">The audible voice of God startled the crowd standing nearby. Some thought it was only thunder, yet others said, &apos;An angel just spoke to him!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">Then Jesus told them,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">&apos;The voice you heard was not for my benefit, but for yours&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">to help you believe.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">From this moment on, everything in this world is about to change,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">for the ruler of this dark world</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">will be overthrown.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">And I will do this</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">when I am lifted up off the ground</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">and when I draw the hearts of people</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">to gather them to me.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">He said this to indicate that he would die by being lifted up on the cross.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">People from the crowd spoke up and said, &apos;Die? How could the Anointed One die? The Word of God says that the Anointed One will live with us forever,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">but you just said that the Son of Man must be lifted up from the earth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">And who is this Son of Man anyway?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">Jesus replied,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">&apos;You will have the light shining with you for only a little while longer. While you still have me, walk in the light, so that the darkness doesn&apos;t overtake you. For when you walk in the dark you have no idea where you&apos;re going.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">So believe and cling to the light while I am with you, so that you will become children of light.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">After saying this, Jesus then entered into the crowd and hid himself from them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">Even with the overwhelming evidence of all the many signs and wonders that Jesus had performed in front of them, his critics still refused to believe.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">This fulfilled the prophecy given by Isaiah: Lord, who has believed our message? Who has seen the unveiling of your great power?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">And the people were not able to believe, for Isaiah also prophesied:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">God has blinded their eyes and hardened their hearts</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">to the truth. So with their eyes and hearts closed they cannot understand the truth nor turn to me so that I could instantly cleanse and heal them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">Isaiah said these things because he had seen and experienced the splendor of Jesus</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">and prophesied about him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">Yet there were many Jewish leaders who believed in Jesus, but because they feared the Pharisees they kept it secret, so they wouldn&apos;t be ostracized by the assembly of the Jews.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43">For they loved the glory that men could give them rather than the glory that came from God!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44">Jesus shouted out passionately,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44">&apos;To believe in me is to also believe in God who sent me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45">For when you look at me you are seeing the One who sent me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46">I have come as a light to shine in this dark world so that all who trust in me will no longer wander in darkness.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="47">If you hear my words and refuse to follow them, I do not judge you. For I have not come to judge you but to save you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="48">If you reject me and refuse to follow my words,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="48">you already have a judge. The message of truth I have given you will rise up to judge you at the Day of Judgment.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="49">For I&apos;m not speaking as someone who is self-appointed, but I speak by the authority of the Father himself who sent me, and who instructed me what to say.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="50">And I know that the Father&apos;s commands result</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="50">in eternal life, and that&apos;s why I speak the very words I&apos;ve heard him speak.&apos;</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="13">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Jesus knew that the night before Passover would be his last night on earth before leaving this world to return to the Father&apos;s side. All throughout his time with his disciples, Jesus had demonstrated a deep and tender love for them. And now he longed to show them the full measure of his love.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Before their evening meal had begun, the accuser</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">had already deeply embedded betrayal</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">into the heart of Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Now Jesus was fully aware that the Father had placed all things under his control, for he had come from God and was about to go back to be with him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">So he got up from the meal and took off his outer robe, and took a towel and wrapped it around his waist.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Then he poured water into a basin and began to wash the disciples&apos; dirty feet and dry them with his towel.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">But when Jesus got to Simon Peter, he objected and said, &apos;I can&apos;t let you wash my dirty feet&apos;you&apos;re my Lord!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Jesus replied,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">&apos;You don&apos;t understand yet the meaning of what I&apos;m doing, but soon it will be clear to you.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Peter looked at Jesus and said, &apos;You&apos;ll never wash my dirty feet&apos;never!&apos; &apos;But Peter, if you don&apos;t allow me to wash your feet,&apos; Jesus responded, &apos;then you will not be able to share life with me.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">So Peter said, &apos;Lord, in that case, don&apos;t just wash my feet, wash my hands and my head too!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Jesus said to him,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">&apos;You are already clean. You&apos;ve been washed completely and you just need your feet to be cleansed&apos;but that can&apos;t be said of all of you.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">For Jesus knew which one was about to betray him,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">and that&apos;s why he told them that not all of them were clean.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">After washing their feet, he put his robe on and returned to his place at the table.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">&apos;Do you understand what I just did?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Jesus said.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">&apos;You&apos;ve called me your teacher and lord, and you&apos;re right, for that&apos;s who I am.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">I speak to you timeless truth: a servant is not superior to his master, and an apostle is never greater than the one who sent him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">So now put into practice what I have done for you, and you will experience a life of happiness enriched with untold blessings!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">&apos;I don&apos;t refer to all of you when I tell you these things, for I know the ones I&apos;ve chosen&apos;to fulfill the Scripture that says, &apos;The one who shared supper with me treacherously betrays me.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">I am telling you this now, before it happens, so that when the prophecy comes to pass you will be convinced that I AM.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">&apos;Listen to this timeless truth: whoever receives the messenger I send receives me, and the one who receives me receives the Father</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">who sent me.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Then Jesus was moved deeply in his spirit.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Looking at his disciples, he announced,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">&apos;I tell you the truth&apos;one of you is about to betray me.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Eyeing each other, his disciples puzzled over which one of them could do such a thing.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">The disciple that Jesus dearly loved</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">was at the right of him at the table</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">and was leaning his head on Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">Peter gestured to this disciple to ask Jesus who it was he was referring to.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">Then the dearly loved disciple leaned into Jesus&apos; chest and whispered, &apos;Master, who is it?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">&apos;The one I give this piece of bread to after I&apos;ve dipped it in the bowl,&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">Jesus replied. Then he dipped the piece of bread into the bowl and handed it to Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">And when Judas ate the piece of bread, Satan</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">entered him. Then Jesus looked at Judas and said,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">&apos;What you are planning to do, go do it now.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">None of those around the table realized what was happening.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">Some thought that Judas, their trusted treasurer, was being told to go buy what was needed for the Passover celebration, or perhaps to go give something to the poor.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">So Judas left quickly and went out into the dark night to betray Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">After Judas left the room, Jesus said,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">&apos;The time has come for the glory of God to surround the Son of Man, and God will be greatly glorified through what happens to me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">And very soon God will unveil the glory of the Son of Man.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">&apos;My dear friends,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">I only have a brief time left to be with you. And then you will search and long for me. But I tell you what I told the Jewish leaders: you&apos;ll not be able to come where I am.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">&apos;So I give you now a new</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">commandment: Love each other just as much as I have loved you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">For when you demonstrate the same love I have for you by loving one another, everyone will know that you&apos;re my true followers.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">Peter interjected, &apos;But, Master, where are you going?&apos; Jesus replied, &apos;Where I am going you won&apos;t be able to follow, but one day you will follow me there.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">Peter</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">said, &apos;What do you mean I&apos;m not able to follow you now? I would sacrifice my life to die for you!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">Jesus answered,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">&apos;Would you really lay down your life for me, Peter? Here&apos;s the absolute truth: Before the rooster crows in the morning, you will say three times that you don&apos;t even know me!&apos;</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="14">
			<VERS vnumber="1">&apos;Don&apos;t worry or surrender to your fear.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">For you&apos;ve believed in God, now trust and believe in me also.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">My Father&apos;s house has many dwelling places.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">If it were otherwise, I would tell you plainly, because I go</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="3">And when everything is ready, I will come back and take</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">you to myself so that you will be where I am.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">And you already know the way to the place where I&apos;m going.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Thomas said to him, &apos;Master, we don&apos;t know where you&apos;re going, so how could we know the way there?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Jesus explained,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">&apos;I am the Way, I am the Truth,</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="8">Philip spoke up, &apos;Lord, show us the Father, and that will be all that we need!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Jesus replied,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">&apos;Philip, I&apos;ve been with you all this time and you still don&apos;t know who I am? How could you ask me to show you the Father, for anyone who has looked at me has seen the Father.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Don&apos;t you believe that the Father is living in me and that I am living in the Father? Even my words are not my own but come from my Father, for he lives in me and performs his miracles of power through me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Believe that I live as one with my Father and that my Father lives as one with me&apos;or at least, believe because of the mighty miracles I have done.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">&apos;I tell you this timeless truth: The person who follows me in faith, believing in me, will do the same mighty miracles that I do&apos;even greater miracles than these because I go to be with my Father!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">For I will do whatever you ask me to do when you ask me in my name. And that is how the Son will show what the Father is really like and bring glory to him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Ask me anything in my name, and I will do it for you!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">&apos;Loving me empowers you to obey my commands.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">&apos;I promise that I will never leave you helpless or abandon you as orphans&apos;I will come back to you!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Soon I will leave this world and they will see me no longer, but you will see me, because I will live again, and you will come alive too.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">So when that day comes, you will know that I am living in the Father and that you are one with me, for I will be living in you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Those who truly love me are those who obey my commands. Whoever passionately loves me will be passionately loved by my Father. And I will passionately love him in return and will reveal</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">myself to him.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Then one of the disciples named Judas</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">(not Judas Iscariot) said, &apos;Lord, why is it you will only reveal your identity to us and not to everyone?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">Jesus replied,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">&apos;Loving me empowers you to obey my word.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">And my Father will love you so deeply that we will come to you and make you our dwelling place.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">But those who don&apos;t love me will not obey my words. The Father did not send me to speak my own revelation, but the words of my Father.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">I am telling you this while I am still with you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">But when the Father sends the Spirit of Holiness, the One like me who sets you free,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">he will teach you all things in my name. And he will inspire you to remember every word that I&apos;ve told you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">&apos;I leave the gift of peace with you&apos;my peace. Not the kind of fragile peace given by the world, but my perfect peace. Don&apos;t yield to fear or be troubled in your hearts&apos;instead, be courageous!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">&apos;Remember what I&apos;ve told you, that I must go away, but I promise to come back to you. So if you truly love me, you will be glad for me, since I&apos;m returning to my Father, who is greater than I.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">So when all of these things happen, you will still trust and cling to me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">I won&apos;t speak with you much longer, for the ruler of this dark world</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">is coming. But he has no power over me,</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="16">Soon you won&apos;t see me any longer, but then, after a little while, you will see me</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">in a new way</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Some of the disciples asked each other, &apos;What does he mean, &apos;Soon you won&apos;t see me,&apos; and, &apos;A little while after that and you will see me in a new way&apos;? And what does he mean, &apos;Because I&apos;m going to my Father&apos;?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">So they kept on repeating, &apos;What&apos;s the meaning of &apos;a little while&apos;? We have no clue what he&apos;s talking about!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Jesus knew what they were thinking, and it was obvious that they were anxious to ask him what he had meant,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">so he spoke up and said,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">&apos;Let me make it quite clear: You will weep and be overcome with grief</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">over what happens to me</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">. The unbelieving world will be happy, while you will be filled with sorrow. But know this, your sadness will turn into joy</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">when you see me again!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Just like a woman giving birth experiences intense labor pains in delivering her baby,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">yet after the child is born she quickly forgets what she went through because of the overwhelming joy of knowing that a new baby has been born into the world.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">&apos;So will you also pass through a time of intense sorrow</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">when I am taken from you</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">, but you will see me again! And then your hearts will burst with joy, with no one being able to take it from you!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">For here is eternal truth: When that time comes you won&apos;t need to ask me for anything, but instead you will go directly to the Father and ask him for anything you desire and he will give it to you, because of your relationship with me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">Until now you&apos;ve not been bold enough to ask the Father for a single thing in my name,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">but now you can ask, and keep on asking him! And you can be sure that you&apos;ll receive what you ask for, and your joy will have no limits!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">&apos;I have spoken to you using figurative language,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">but the time is coming when I will no longer teach you with veiled speech, but I will teach you about the Father with your eyes unveiled.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">And I will not need to ask the Father on your behalf, for you&apos;ll ask him directly because of your new relationship with me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">For the Father tenderly loves you, because you love me and believe that I&apos;ve come from God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">I came to you sent from the Father&apos;s presence, and I entered into the created world, and now I will leave this world and return to the Father&apos;s side.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">His disciples said, &apos;At last you&apos;re speaking to us clearly and not using veiled speech and metaphors!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">Now we understand that you know everything there is to know, and we don&apos;t need to question you further. And everything you&apos;ve taught us convinces us that you have come directly from God!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">Jesus replied,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">&apos;Now you finally believe in me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">And the time has come when you will all be scattered, and each one of you will go your own way, leaving me alone!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">Yet I am never alone, for the Father is always with me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">And everything I&apos;ve taught you is so that the peace which is in me will be in you and will give you great confidence as you rest in me. For in this unbelieving world you will experience trouble and sorrows, but you must be courageous,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">for I have conquered the world!&apos;</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="17">
			<VERS vnumber="1">This is what Jesus prayed as he looked up into heaven, &apos;Father, the time has come. Unveil the glorious splendor of your Son so that I will magnify your glory!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">You have already given me authority</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">over all people so that I may give the gift of eternal life to all those that you have given to me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Eternal life means to know and experience you as the only true God, and to know and experience Jesus Christ, as the Son whom you have sent.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">I have glorified you on the earth by faithfully doing everything you&apos;ve told me to do.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">So my Father, restore me back to the glory that we shared together when we were face-to-face before the universe was created.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">&apos;Father, I have manifested who you really are and I have revealed you to the men and women that you gave to me. They were yours, and you gave them to me, and they have fastened your Word firmly to their hearts.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">And now at last they know that everything I have is a gift from you,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">And the very words you gave to me to speak I have passed on to them. They have received your words and carry them in their hearts. They are convinced that I have come from your presence, and they have fully believed that you sent me to represent you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">So with deep love,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">I pray for my disciples. I&apos;m not asking on behalf of the unbelieving world, but for those who belong to you, those you have given me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">For all who belong to me now belong to you. And all who belong to you now belong to me as well, and my glory is revealed through their surrendered lives.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">&apos;Holy Father, I am about to leave this world</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">to return and be with you, but my disciples will remain here. Holy Father, each one that you have given me, keep them in your name so that they will be united as one, even as we are one.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">While I was with these that you have given me,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">I was guarding them and keeping them in your name. Not one of them is lost, except the one that was destined to be lost, so that the Scripture would be fulfilled.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">&apos;But now I am returning to you so Father, I pray that they will experience and enter into my joyous delight in you so that it is fulfilled in them and overflows.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">I have given them your message and that is why the unbelieving world hates them. For their allegiance is no longer to this world because I am not of this world.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">I am not asking that you remove them from the world, but I ask that you guard their hearts from evil,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">For they no longer belong to this world any more than I do.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">&apos;Your Word is truth! So make them holy by the truth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">I have commissioned them to represent me just as you commissioned me to represent you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">And now I dedicate myself to them as a holy sacrifice so that they will live as fully dedicated to God and be made holy by your truth.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">&apos;And I ask not only for these disciples, but also for all those who will one day believe in me through their message.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">I pray for them all to be joined together as one</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">even as you and I, Father, are joined together as one. I pray for them to become one with us so that the world will recognize that you sent me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">For the very glory you have given to me I have given them so that they will be joined together as one and experience the same unity that we enjoy.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">You live fully in me and now I live fully in them so that they will experience perfect unity, and the world will be convinced that you have sent me, for they will see that you love each one of them with the same passionate love that you have for me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">&apos;Father, I ask that you allow everyone that you have given to me to be with me where I am! Then they will see my full glory&apos; the very splendor you have placed upon me because you have loved me even before the beginning of time.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">&apos;You are my righteous Father,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">but the unbelieving world has never known you in the perfect way that I know you! And all those who believe in me also know that you have sent me!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">I have revealed to them who you are</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">and I will continue to make you even more real to them, so that they may experience the same endless love that you have for me, for your love will now live in them, even as I live in them!&apos;</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="18">
			<VERS vnumber="1">After Jesus finished this prayer; he left with his disciples and went across the Kidron Valley</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">to a place where there was a garden.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Judas, the traitor, knew where this place was, for Jesus had gone there often with his disciples.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">The Pharisees and the leading priests had given Judas a large detachment</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">of Roman soldiers and temple police to seize Jesus. Judas guided them to the garden, all of them carrying torches and lanterns and armed</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">with swords and spears</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Jesus, knowing full well what was about to happen, went out to the garden entrance to meet them. Stepping forward, he asked,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">&apos;Who are you looking for?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">&apos;Jesus of Nazareth,&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">they replied. (Now Judas, the traitor, was among them.) He replied, &apos;I am he.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">And the moment Jesus spoke the words,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">&apos;I am he,&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">the mob fell backward to the ground!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">So once more, Jesus asked them,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">&apos;Who are you looking for?&apos; As they stood up, they answered, &apos;Jesus of Nazareth.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Jesus replied,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">&apos;I told you that I am the one you&apos;re looking for, so if you want me, let these men go home.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">He said this to fulfill the prophecy he had spoken,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">&apos;Father, not one of those you have given me has been lost.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Suddenly, Peter took out his sword and struck the high priest&apos;s servant, slashing off his right ear!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">The servant&apos;s name was Malchus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Jesus ordered Peter,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">&apos;Put your sword away! Do you really think I will avoid the suffering</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">which my Father has assigned to me?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Then the soldiers and their captain, along with the Jewish officers, seized Jesus and tied him up.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">They took him first to Annas,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">as he was the father-in-law of Caiaphas, the high priest that year.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Caiaphas was the one who had persuaded the Jewish leaders that it would be better off to have one person die for the sake of the people.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Peter and another disciple followed along behind them as they took Jesus into the courtyard of Annas&apos; palace. Since the other disciple was well known to the high priest, he entered in,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">but Peter was left standing outside by the gate. Then the other disciple came back out to the servant girl who was guarding the gate and convinced her to allow Peter inside.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">As he passed inside, the young servant girl guarding the gate took a look at Peter and said to him, &apos;Aren&apos;t you one of his disciples?&apos; He denied it, saying, &apos;No! I&apos;m not!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Now because it was cold, the soldiers and guards made a charcoal fire and were standing around it to keep warm. So Peter huddled there with them around the fire.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">The high priest interrogated Jesus concerning his disciples</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">and his teachings.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Jesus answered Annas&apos; questions by saying,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">&apos;I have said nothing in secret. At all times I have taught openly and publicly in a synagogue, in the temple courts, and wherever the people assemble.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Why would you ask me for evidence to condemn me? Ask those who have heard what I&apos;ve taught. They can tell you.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Just then one of the guards standing near Jesus punched him in the face with his fist</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">and said, &apos;How dare you answer the high priest like that!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">Jesus replied,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">&apos;If my words are evil, then prove it. But if I haven&apos;t broken any laws, then why would you hit me?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">Then Annas sent Jesus, still tied up, across the way to the high priest Caiaphas.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">Meanwhile, Peter was still standing in the courtyard by the fire. And one of the guards standing there said to him, &apos;Aren&apos;t you one of his disciples? I know you are!&apos; Peter swore</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">and said, &apos;I am not his disciple!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">But one of the servants of the high priest, a relative to the man whose ear Peter had cut off, looked at him and said, &apos;Wait! Didn&apos;t I see you out there in the garden with Jesus?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">Then Peter denied it the third time and said, &apos;No!&apos;&apos;and at that very same moment, a rooster crowed nearby.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">Before dawn they took Jesus from his trial before Caiaphas to the Roman governor&apos;s palace.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">Now the Jews refused to go into the Roman governor&apos;s residence to avoid ceremonial defilement before eating the Passover meal.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">So Pilate came outside where they waited and asked them pointedly, &apos;Tell me, what exactly is the accusation</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">that you bring against this man? What has he done?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">They answered, &apos;We wouldn&apos;t be coming here to hand over</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">this &apos;criminal&apos; to you if he wasn&apos;t guilty of some wrongdoing!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">Pilate said, &apos;Very well, then you take him yourselves and go pass judgment on him according to your Jewish laws!&apos; But the Jewish leaders complained and said, &apos;We don&apos;t have legal authority to put anyone to death. You should have him crucified !&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">(This was to fulfill the words of Jesus when he predicted the manner of death that he would die.)</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">Upon hearing this, Pilate went back inside his palace and summoned Jesus. Looking him over, Pilate asked him, &apos;Are you really the king of the Jews?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">Jesus replied,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">&apos;Are you asking because you really want to know,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">or are you only asking this because others have said it about me?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">Pilate responded, &apos;Only a Jew would care about this; do I look like a Jew? It&apos;s your own people and your religious leaders that have handed you over to me. So tell me, Jesus, what have you done wrong?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">Jesus looked at Pilate and said,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">&apos;The royal power of my kingdom realm doesn&apos;t come from this world. If it did, then my followers would be fighting to the end to defend me from the Jewish leaders. My kingdom realm authority is not</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">from this realm.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">Then Pilate responded, &apos;Oh, so then you are a king?&apos; &apos;You are right.&apos; Jesus said, &apos;I was born a King, and I have come into this world to prove what truth really is. And everyone who loves the truth will receive my words.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">Pilate looked at Jesus and said, &apos;What is truth?&apos; As silence filled the room, Pilate went back out to where the Jewish leaders were waiting and said to them, &apos;He&apos;s not guilty. I couldn&apos;t even find one fault with him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">Now, you do know that we have a custom that I release one prisoner every year at Passover&apos;shall I release your king&apos;the king of the Jews?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">They shouted out over and over, &apos;No, not him! Give us Barabbas!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">(Now Barabbas was a robber and a troublemaker.)</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="19">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Then Pilate ordered Jesus to be brutally beaten with a whip of leather straps embedded with metal.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">And the soldiers also wove thorn-branches into a crown and set it on his head and placed a purple</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">robe over his shoulders.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Then, one by one, they came in front of him to mock him by saying, &apos;Hail, to the king of the Jews!&apos; And one after the other, they repeatedly punched him in the face.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Once more Pilate went out and said to the Jewish officials, &apos;I will bring him out once more so that you know that I&apos;ve found nothing wrong with him.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">So when Jesus emerged,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">bleeding</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">, wearing the purple robe and the crown of thorns on his head, Pilate said to them, &apos;Look at him! Here is your man!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">No sooner did the high priests and the temple guards see Jesus that they all shouted in a frenzy, &apos;Crucify him! Crucify him!&apos; Pilate replied, &apos;You take him then and nail him to a cross yourselves! I told you&apos;he&apos;s not guilty! I find no reason to condemn him.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">The Jewish leaders shouted back, &apos;But we have the Law! And according to our Law, he must die,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">because he claimed to be the Son of God!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Then Pilate was greatly alarmed</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">when he heard that Jesus claimed to be the Son of God!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">So he took Jesus back inside and said to him, &apos;Where have you come from?&apos; But once again, silence filled the room.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Perplexed, Pilate said, &apos;Are you going to play deaf? Don&apos;t you know that I have the power to grant you your freedom or nail you to a tree?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Jesus answered,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">&apos;You would have no power over me at all, unless it was given to you from above. This is why the one who betrayed</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">me is guilty of an even greater sin.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">From then on Pilate tried to find a way out of the situation and to set him free, but the Jewish authorities shouted him down: &apos;If you let this man go, you&apos;re no friend of Caesar! Anyone who declares himself a king is an enemy of the emperor!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">So when Pilate heard this threat, he relented and had Jesus,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">who was torn and bleeding</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">, brought outside. Then he went up the elevated stone platform and took his seat on the judgment bench&apos;which in Aramaic is called Gabbatha,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">or &apos;The Bench.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">And it was now almost noon. And it was the same day they were preparing to slay the Passover lambs. Then Pilate said to the Jewish officials, &apos;Look! Here is your king!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">But they screamed out, &apos;Take him away! Take him away and crucify him!&apos; Pilate replied, &apos;Shall I nail your king to a cross?&apos; The high priests answered, &apos;We have no other king but Caesar!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Then Pilate handed Jesus over to them. So the soldiers seized him and took him away to be crucified.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Jesus carried his own cross out of the city to the place called &apos;The Skull,&apos; which in Aramaic is Golgotha.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">And there they nailed him to the cross. He was crucified, along with two others, one on each side with Jesus in the middle.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">But the chief priests of the Jews</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">said to Pilate, &apos;You must change the sign! Don&apos;t let it say, &apos;King of the Jews,&apos; but rather&apos;&apos;he claimed to be the King of the Jews!&apos; &apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Pilate responded, &apos;What I have written will remain!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">Now when the soldiers crucified Jesus, they divided up his clothes into four shares, one for each of them. But his tunic was seamless, woven from the top to the bottom</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">as a single garment.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">So the soldiers said to each other, &apos;Don&apos;t tear it&apos;let&apos;s throw dice</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">to see who gets it!&apos; The soldiers did all of this not knowing they fulfilled the Scripture that says, &apos;They divided my garments among them and gambled for my clothing.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">Mary, Jesus&apos; mother, was standing next to his cross, along with Mary&apos;s sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">So when Jesus looked down and saw the disciple he loved standing with her, he said,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">&apos;Mother,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">look&apos;John</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">will be a son to you.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">Then he said,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">John,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">look&apos;she will be a mother to you!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">From that day on, John accepted Mary into his home</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">as one of his own family</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">Jesus knew that his mission was accomplished, and to fulfill the Scripture,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">Jesus said:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">&apos;I am thirsty.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">A jar of sour wine was sitting nearby, so they soaked a sponge with it and put it on the stalk of hyssop</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">and raised it to his lips.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">When he had sipped the sour wine, he said,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">&apos;It is finished, my bride!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">Then he bowed his head and surrendered his spirit to God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">The Jewish leaders did not want the bodies of the victims to remain on the cross through the next day, since it was the day of preparation</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">for a very important Sabbath. So they asked Pilate&apos;s permission to have the victims&apos; legs broken</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">to hasten their death</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">and their bodies taken down before sunset.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">So the soldiers broke the legs of the two men who were nailed there.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">But when they came to Jesus, they realized that he had already died, so they decided not to break his legs.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">But one of the soldiers</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">took a spear and pierced Jesus&apos; side, and blood and water gushed out.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">(I, John,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">do testify to the certainty of what took place, and I write the truth so that you might also believe.)</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">For all these things happened to fulfill the prophecies of the Scriptures: &apos;Not one of his bones will be broken,&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">and, &apos;They will gaze on the one they have pierced!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">After this, Joseph from the city of Ramah,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">who was a secret disciple of Jesus for fear of the Jewish authorities, asked Pilate if he could remove the body of Jesus. So Pilate granted him permission to remove the body from the cross.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">Now Nicodemus, who had once come to Jesus privately at night, accompanied Joseph, and together they carried a significant amount</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">of myrrh and aloes to the cross.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">Then they took Jesus&apos; body and wrapped it in strips of linen with the embalming spices</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">according to the Jewish burial customs.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">Near the place where Jesus was crucified was a garden, and in the garden there was a new tomb where no one had yet been laid to rest.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">And because the Sabbath was approaching, and the tomb was nearby, that&apos;s where they laid the body of Jesus.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="20">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Very early Sunday morning,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">before sunrise, Mary Magdalene made her way to the tomb. And when she arrived she discovered that the stone that sealed the entrance to the tomb was moved away!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">So she went running as fast as she could to go tell Peter and the other disciple, the one Jesus loved.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">She told them, &apos;They&apos;ve taken the Lord&apos;s body from the tomb, and we don&apos;t know where he is!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Then Peter and the other disciple jumped up and ran to the tomb to go see for themselves.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">They started out together, but the other disciple outran Peter and reached the tomb first.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">He didn&apos;t enter the tomb, but peeked in, and saw only the linen cloths lying there.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Then Peter came behind him and went right into the tomb. He too noticed the linen cloths lying there,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">but the burial cloth that had been on Jesus&apos; head had been rolled up and placed separate from the other cloths.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Then the other disciple who had reached the tomb first went in, and after one look, he believed!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">For until then they hadn&apos;t understood the Scriptures that prophesied</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">that he was destined to rise from the dead.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Puzzled, Peter and the other disciple then left and went back to their homes.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Mary arrived</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">back at the tomb</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">, broken and sobbing. She stooped to peer inside, and through her tears</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">she saw two angels in dazzling white robes, sitting where Jesus&apos; body had been laid&apos;one at the head and one at the feet!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">&apos;Dear woman, why are you crying?&apos; they asked. Mary answered, &apos;They have taken away my Lord, and I don&apos;t know where they&apos;ve laid him.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Then she turned around to leave, and there was Jesus standing in front of her, but she didn&apos;t realize that it was him!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">He said to her,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">&apos;Dear woman, why are you crying? Who are you looking for?&apos; Mary answered, thinking he was only the gardener, &apos;Sir, if you have taken his body somewhere else, tell me, and I will go and . . .&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">&apos;Mary,&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Jesus interrupted her. Turning to face him, she said, &apos;Rabboni!&apos; (Aramaic for &apos;My teacher!&apos;)</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Jesus cautioned her,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">&apos;Mary, don&apos;t cling to me,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">for I haven&apos;t yet ascended to God, my Father. And he&apos;s not only my Father and God, but now he&apos;s your Father and your God! Now go to my brothers</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">and tell them what I&apos;ve told you, that I am ascending to my Father&apos;and your Father, to my God&apos;and your God!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Then Mary Magdalene left to inform the disciples of her encounter with Jesus. &apos;I have seen the Lord!&apos; she told them. And she gave them his message.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">That evening,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">the disciples gathered together, and because they were afraid of reprisals from the Jewish leaders, they had locked the doors. But suddenly Jesus appeared among them and said,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">&apos;Peace to you!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Then he showed them the wounds of his hands and his side&apos;they were overjoyed to see the Lord with their own eyes!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Jesus repeated his greeting,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">&apos;Peace to you!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">And he told them,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">&apos;Just as the Father has sent me, I&apos;m now sending you.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Then, taking a deep breath, he blew</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">on them and said,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">&apos;Receive the Holy Spirit.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">I send you to preach the forgiveness</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">of sins&apos;and people&apos;s sins will be forgiven. But if you don&apos;t proclaim the forgiveness of their sins, they will remain guilty.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">One of the twelve wasn&apos;t present when Jesus appeared to them&apos;it was Thomas, whose nickname was &apos;the Twin.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">So the disciples informed him, &apos;We have seen the Lord with our own eyes!&apos; Still unconvinced, Thomas replied, &apos;There&apos;s no way I&apos;m going to believe this unless I personally see the wounds of the nails in his hands, touch them with my finger, and put my hand into the wound of his side where he was pierced!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">Then eight days later, Thomas and all the others were in the house together. And even though all the doors were locked, Jesus suddenly stood before them!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">&apos;Peace to you,&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">he said.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">Then, looking into Thomas&apos; eyes, he said,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">&apos;Put your finger here in the wounds of my hands. Here&apos;put your hand into my wounded side and see for yourself. Thomas, don&apos;t give in to your doubts any longer, just believe!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">Then the words spilled out of his heart&apos;&apos;You are my Lord, and you are my God!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">Jesus responded,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">&apos;Thomas, now that you&apos;ve seen me, you believe. But there are those who have never seen me with their eyes but have believed in me with their hearts, and they will be blessed even more!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">Jesus went on to do many more miraculous signs in the presence of his disciples, which are not even included in this book.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">But all that is recorded here is so that you will fully believe</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">that Jesus is the Anointed One, the Son of God, and that through your faith in him you will experience eternal life</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">by the power of his name!</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="21">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Later, Jesus appeared once again to a group of his disciples by Lake Galilee.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">It happened one day while Peter, Thomas (the Twin), Nathanael (from Cana in Galilee), Jacob, John,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">and two other disciples were all together.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Peter told them, &apos;I&apos;m going fishing.&apos; And they all replied, &apos;We&apos;ll go with you.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">So they went out and fished through the night, but caught nothing.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Then at dawn, Jesus was standing there on the shore, but the disciples didn&apos;t realize that it was him!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">He called out to them, saying,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">&apos;Hey guys! Did you catch any fish?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">&apos;Not a thing,&apos; they replied.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Jesus shouted to them,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">&apos;Throw your net over the starboard side, and you&apos;ll catch some!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">And so they did as he said, and they caught so many fish they couldn&apos;t even pull in the net!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Then the disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter, &apos;It&apos;s the Lord!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">When Peter heard him say that, he quickly wrapped his outer garment around him, and because he was athletic,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">he dove right into the lake to go to Jesus!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">The other disciples then brought the boat to shore, dragging their catch of fish. They weren&apos;t far from land, only about a hundred meters.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">And when they got to shore, they noticed a charcoal fire with some roasted fish and bread.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Then Jesus said,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">&apos;Bring some of the fish you just caught.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">So Peter waded into the water and helped pull the net to shore. It was full of many large fish, exactly one hundred and fifty-three,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">but even with so many fish, the net was not torn.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">&apos;Come, let&apos;s have some breakfast,&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Jesus said to them. And not one of the disciples needed to ask who it was, because every one of them knew it was the Lord.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Then Jesus came close to them and served them the bread and the fish.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">This was the third time Jesus appeared to his disciples after his resurrection.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">After they had breakfast, Jesus said to Peter,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">&apos;Simon, son of Jonah,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">do you burn with love</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">for me more than these?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Peter answered, &apos;Yes, Lord! You know that I have great affection for you!&apos; &apos;Then take care of my lambs,&apos; Jesus said.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Jesus repeated his question the second time,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">&apos;Simon, son of Jonah, do you burn with love for me?&apos; Peter answered, &apos;Yes, my Lord! You know that I have great affection for you!&apos; &apos;Then take care of my sheep,&apos; Jesus said.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Then Jesus asked him again,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">&apos;Peter, son of Jonah, do you have great affection for me?&apos; Peter was saddened by being asked the third time and said, &apos;My Lord, you know everything. You know that I burn with love for you!&apos; Jesus replied, &apos;Then feed my lambs!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Peter, listen, when you were younger you made your own choices</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">and you went where you pleased. But one day when you are old,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">others will tie you up and escort you where you would not choose to go&apos;and you will spread out your arms.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">(Jesus said this to Peter as a prophecy of what kind of death he would die, for the glory of God.) And then he said,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">&apos;Peter, follow me!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Then Peter turned and saw that the disciple whom Jesus loved was following them. (This was the disciple who sat close to Jesus at the Last Supper and had asked him, &apos;Lord, who is the one that will betray you?&apos;)</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">So when Peter saw him, he asked Jesus, &apos;What&apos;s going to happen to him?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Jesus replied,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">&apos;If I decide to let him live until I return, what concern is that of yours? You must still keep on following me!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">So the rumor started to circulate among the believers that this disciple wasn&apos;t going to die. But Jesus never said that, he only said,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">&apos;If I let him live until I return, what concern is that of yours?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">I, John,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">am that disciple who has written these things to testify of the truth, and we</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">know that what I&apos;ve documented is accurate.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">Jesus did countless things that I haven&apos;t included here. And if every one of his works were written down</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">and described one by one</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">I suppose that the world itself wouldn&apos;t have enough room to contain the books that would have to be written!</VERS>

	<BIBLEBOOK bnumber="44" bname="Acts">
		<CHAPTER cnumber="1">
			<VERS vnumber="1">To Theophilus,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">the lover of God. I write to you again, my dear friend, to give you further details about the life of our Lord Jesus and all the things that he did and taught.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Just before he ascended into heaven, Jesus left instructions</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">through the Holy Spirit for the apostles he had chosen.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">After the sufferings of his cross, Jesus appeared alive</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">many times</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">to these same apostles over a forty-day period,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">proving to them with many convincing signs that he had been resurrected.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">During these encounters, he taught them the truths of God&apos;s kingdom.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Jesus instructed them,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">&apos;Don&apos;t leave Jerusalem, but wait here until you receive the gift I told you about, the gift the Father has promised.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">For John baptized you in water, but in a few days from now you will be baptized in the Holy Spirit!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Every time they were gathered together, they asked Jesus, &apos;Lord, is it now the time for you to free Israel and restore our kingdom?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">He answered,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">&apos;The Father is the one who sets the fixed dates and the times of their fulfillment. You are not permitted to know the timing of all that he has prepared by his own authority.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">But I promise you this&apos;the Holy Spirit will come upon you, and you will be seized with power.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">You will be my messengers</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">to Jerusalem, throughout Judea, the distant provinces</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">&apos;even to the remotest places on earth!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Right after Jesus spoke those words, the disciples saw him being lifted into the sky, and disappearing into a cloud!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">As they stared into the sky, watching Jesus ascend, two men in white robes suddenly appeared beside them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">They told the startled disciples, &apos;Galileans, why are you staring up into the sky? Jesus has been taken from you into heaven, but he will come back in the same way that you saw him ascend.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">The disciples left the Mount of Olives and returned to Jerusalem, which was less than a mile away.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">During this time Peter stood up among the 120 believers who were gathered and said,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">&apos;Fellow believers,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">the Scripture David prophesied by the Holy Spirit concerning Judas had to be fulfilled.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Judas betrayed our Lord Jesus and led the mob to the garden to arrest him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">He was one of us, and he was chosen to be an apostle just as we were.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">He earned the wages of his sin,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">for he fell headfirst, and his belly split open, spilling his intestines on the ground.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Everyone in Jerusalem knows what happened to him. That&apos;s why the field where he died is called in Aramaic</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">&apos;Haqel Dama,&apos; that is, &apos;The Bloody Field.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">For it is written in the Psalms: &apos;Let his house be deserted and become a wasteland. No one will live there.&apos; And also: &apos;Let another take his ministry.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">&apos;So then, we must choose his replacement from among those who have been with us from the very beginning,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">from John&apos;s baptism until Jesus&apos; ascension. And, like us, he must be a witness of his resurrection.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">They proposed two candidates: Joseph, who is also called Barsabbas the Just, and Matthias.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">They all prayed, &apos;Lord Yahweh,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">you know the heart of every man.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">Please give us clear revelation to know which of these two men you have chosen</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">to be an apostle and take Judas&apos; place because he renounced his apostleship to go where he belonged.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">They cast lots</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">and determined that Matthias was the Lord&apos;s choice, so he was added to the eleven apostles.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="2">
			<VERS vnumber="1">On the day Pentecost was being fulfilled,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">all the disciples were gathered in one place.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Suddenly they heard the sound of a violent blast of wind</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">rushing into the house</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">from out of the heavenly realm. The roar of the wind was so overpowering it was all anyone could bear!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Then all at once a pillar of fire appeared before their eyes</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">It separated into tongues of fire that engulfed</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">each one of them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">They were all filled and equipped</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">with the Holy Spirit and were inspired</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">to speak in tongues&apos;empowered by the Spirit to speak in languages they had never learned!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Now, at that time there were Jewish worshipers</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">who had emigrated from many different lands to live in Jerusalem.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">When the people</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">of the city heard the roaring sound, crowds came running to where it was coming from, stunned over what was happening, because each one could hear the disciples speaking in his or her own language.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Bewildered, they said to one another, &apos;Aren&apos;t these all Galileans?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">So how is it that we hear them speaking in our own languages?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">We are northeastern Iranians,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">northwestern Iranians,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Elamites,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">and those from Mesopotamia,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Judea, east central Turkey,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">the coastal areas of the Black Sea,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Asia,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">north central Turkey,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">southern Turkey, Egypt, Libyans who are neighbors of Cyrene, visitors from all over the Roman Empire, both Jews and converts to Judaism, Cretans and Arabs.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Yet we hear them speaking of God&apos;s mighty wonders in our own dialects!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">They all stood there, dumbfounded and astonished, saying to one another, &apos;What is this phenomenon?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">But others poked fun at them and said, &apos;They&apos;re just drunk on new wine.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Peter stood up with the eleven apostles</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">and shouted</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">to the crowd. &apos;Listen carefully, my fellow Jews</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">and residents of Jerusalem. You need to clearly understand what&apos;s happening here.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">These people are not drunk like you think they are, for it is only nine o&apos;clock in the morning.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">This is</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">the fulfillment of</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">what was prophesied through the prophet Joel,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">for God says</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">&apos;This is what I will do in the last days</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">&apos;I will pour out</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">my Spirit on everybody and cause your sons and daughters to prophesy, and your young men will see visions,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">and your old men will experience dreams</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">from God</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">The Holy Spirit will come upon all my servants, men and women alike, and they will prophesy.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">I will reveal startling signs and wonders in the sky above and mighty miracles on the earth below. Blood and fire and pillars of clouds</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">will appear.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">For the sun will be turned dark</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">and the moon blood-red before that great and awesome appearance of the day of the Lord.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">But everyone who calls on the name of the Lord</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">will be saved.&apos; &apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Peter continued, &apos;People of Israel, listen to the facts.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Jesus, the Victorious,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">was a man on a divine mission</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">whose authority was clearly proven. For you know how God performed many powerful miracles, signs, and wonders through him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">This Man&apos;s destiny was prearranged, for God knew that Jesus would be handed over to you to be crucified and that you would execute him on a cross by the hands of lawless men. Yet it was all part of his predetermined plan.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">God destroyed the cords of death</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">and raised him up, because it was impossible for death&apos;s power to hold him prisoner.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">This is the very thing David prophesied about him: &apos;I continually see the Lord in front of me. He&apos;s at my right hand, and I am never shaken.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">No wonder my heart is glad and my glory celebrates! My mouth is filled with his praises, and I have hope that my body will live</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">because you will not leave my soul among the dead, nor will you allow your sacred one to experience decay.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">For you have revealed to me the pathways to life, and seeing your face fills me with euphoria!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">&apos;My fellow Jews, I can tell you there is no doubt that our noted patriarch has both died and been buried in his tomb, which remains to this day.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">So you can see that he was not referring to himself with those words</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">But as a prophet, he knew God&apos;s faithful promise, made with God&apos;s unbreakable oath, that one of his descendants would take his throne.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">So when peering into the future, David prophesied</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">of the Messiah&apos;s resurrection.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">And God revealed to him</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">that the Messiah would not be abandoned to the realm of death, nor would his body experience decay.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">&apos;Can&apos;t you see it? God has resurrected Jesus, and we all have seen him!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">&apos;Then God exalted him to his right hand upon the throne of highest honor. And the Father gave him the authority to send the promised Holy Spirit, which is being poured out</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">upon us today. This is what you&apos;re seeing and hearing!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">&apos;David wasn&apos;t the one who ascended into heaven, but the one who prophesied: &apos;Yahweh said to my Lord, I honor you by enthroning you beside me,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">until I make your enemies a footstool beneath your feet.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">&apos;Now everyone in Israel</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">can know for certain</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">that Jesus, whom you crucified, is the one God has made</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">both Lord</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">and the Messiah.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">When they heard this they were crushed and realized what they had done to Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">Deeply moved, they said to Peter and the other apostles, &apos;What do we need to do, brothers?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">Peter replied, &apos;Repent and return to God,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">and each one of you must be baptized in the name of Jesus, the Anointed One,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">to have your sins removed. Then you may take hold of the gift of the Holy Spirit.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">For God&apos;s promise of the Holy Spirit is for you</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">and your families, for those yet to be born</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">and for everyone whom the Lord our God calls to himself.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">Peter preached to them and warned them with these words: &apos;Be rescued from the wayward and perverse culture of this world!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">Those who believed the word that day numbered three thousand. They were all baptized and added</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">to the church</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">Every believer was faithfully devoted to following the teachings</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">of the apostles. Their hearts were mutually linked to one another,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">sharing communion</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">and coming together regularly for prayer.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43">A deep sense of holy awe</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43">swept over everyone, and the apostles performed many miraculous signs and wonders.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44">All the believers were in fellowship as one body,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44">and they shared with one another whatever they had.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45">Out of generosity</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45">they even sold their assets to distribute the proceeds to those who were in need among them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46">Daily they met together in the temple courts and in one another&apos;s homes to celebrate communion. They shared meals together with joyful hearts and tender humility.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="47">They were continually filled with praises to God, enjoying the favor of all the people. And the Lord kept adding to their number daily those who were coming to life.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="3">
			<VERS vnumber="1">One afternoon Peter and John went to the temple for the three o&apos;clock prayer.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">As they came to the entrance called the Beautiful Gate,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">they were captured by the sight of a man crippled from birth being carried and placed at the entrance to the temple. He was often brought there to beg for money from those going in to worship.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">When he noticed Peter and John going into the temple, he begged them for money.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Peter and John, looking straight into the eyes of the crippled man, said, &apos;Look at us!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Expecting a gift, he readily gave them his attention.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Then Peter said, &apos;I don&apos;t have money, but I&apos;ll give you this&apos;by the power of the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, stand up and walk!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">When all the people saw him jumping up and down and heard him glorifying God,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">they realized it was the crippled beggar they had passed by in front of the Beautiful Gate. Astonishment swept over the crowd, for they were amazed over what had happened to him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Dumbfounded over what they were witnessing, the crowd ran over to Peter and John, who were standing under the covered walkway called Solomon&apos;s Porch. Standing there also was the healed beggar, clinging to Peter and John.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">With the crowd surrounding him, Peter said to them all, &apos;People of Israel,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">listen to me! Why are you so amazed by this healing? Why do you stare at us? We didn&apos;t make this crippled man walk by our own power or authority.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">The God of our ancestors, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">has done this</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">. For he has glorified his Servant</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Jesus, the one you denied to Pilate&apos;s face when he decided to release him&apos;and you insisted that he be crucified.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">You rejected</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">the one who is holy and righteous, and instead begged for a murderer to be released.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">You killed the Prince of Life!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">But God raised him from the dead, and we stand here as witnesses to that fact.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Faith in Jesus&apos; name has healed this man standing before you. It is the faith that comes through believing in Jesus&apos; name that has made the crippled man walk right in front of your eyes!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">&apos;My fellow Jews, I realize that neither you nor your leaders realize the grave mistake you made.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">But in spite of what you&apos;ve done, God has fulfilled what he foretold through the prophets long ago about the sufferings of his Anointed One.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">And now you must repent and turn back</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">to God so that your sins will be removed,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">and so that times of refreshing</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">will stream from the Lord&apos;s presence.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">And he will send you Jesus, the Messiah, the appointed one.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">For he must remain in heaven until the restoration of all things</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="21">fulfilling everything that God said</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">long ago through his holy prophets.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">For has not Moses told us: &apos;The Lord your God will raise up a prophet from among you who is like me. Listen to him and follow everything he tells you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">Every person who disobeys that prophet will be cut off and completely destroyed.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">&apos;In fact, every prophet from the time of Samuel onward has prophesied of these very days!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">And you are heirs of their prophecies</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="3">They had them arrested, and since it was already evening they kept them in custody until the next day.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Yet there were many in the crowd who believed the message,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">bringing the total number of men who believed</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">to nearly five thousand!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">The next day many Jewish leaders, religious scholars, and elders of the people convened a meeting in Jerusalem.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Annas the high priest was there with Caiaphas, John, Alexander,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">and others who were members of the high priest&apos;s family.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">They made Peter and John stand in front of the council as they questioned them, saying, &apos;Tell us, by what power and authority have you done these things?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit, answered, &apos;Respected elders and leaders of the people, listen.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Are we being put on trial today for doing an act of kindness by healing a frail, crippled man? Well then,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">you and everyone else in Israel should know that it is by the power of the name of Jesus that the crippled man stands here today completely healed! You crucified Jesus Christ of Nazareth,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">but God raised him from the dead.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">This Jesus is &apos;the stone that you, the builders, have rejected, and now he has become the cornerstone!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">There is no one else</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">who has the power to save us, for there is only one name to whom God has given authority by which we must experience salvation:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">the name of Jesus</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">The council members were astonished as they witnessed the bold courage</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">of Peter and John, especially when they discovered that they were just ordinary men who had never had religious training.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Then they began to understand the effect Jesus had on them simply by spending time with him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Standing there with them was the healed man, and there was nothing further they could say.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">So they ordered them to leave the room while they discussed the matter. Among themselves, they said,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">&apos;What should we do with these men? Everyone in Jerusalem can clearly see that they&apos;ve performed a notable sign and wonder&apos;we can&apos;t deny that.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">But to keep this propaganda from spreading any further among the people, let&apos;s threaten them severely and warn them to never speak to anyone in this name again.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">So they had them brought back in before the council, and they commanded them to never teach the people or speak again using the name of Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">But Peter and John replied, &apos;You can judge for yourselves&apos;is it better to listen to you or to God?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">It&apos;s impossible for us to stop speaking about all the things we&apos;ve seen and heard!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Since the members of the council couldn&apos;t come up with a crime they could punish them for, they threatened them once more and let them go. All the people praised God, thrilled over the miraculous healing of the crippled man.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">And the man who received this miracle sign of healing was over forty years old.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">As soon as they were released from custody, Peter and John went to the other believers and explained all that had happened with the high priest and the elders.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">When the believers heard their report, they raised their voices in unity and prayed, &apos;Lord Yahweh,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">you are the Lord of all! You created the universe&apos;the earth, the sky, the sea, and everything that is in them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">And you spoke by the Holy Spirit through your servant David, our forefather, saying: &apos;How dare the nations plan a rebellion, ranting and raging against the Lord Most High? Their foolish plots are futile!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">Look at how the kings of the earth take their stand, with the rulers scheming and conspiring together against God and his anointed Messiah!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">&apos;In fact, Herod and Pontius Pilate, along with Jews and non-Jews, met together to take their stand against your holy servant, Jesus the Messiah.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">They did to him all that your purpose and will had determined, according to the destiny you had marked out for him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">So now, Lord, listen to their threats to harm us. Empower us, as your servants, to speak the word of God freely and courageously.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">Stretch out your hand of power</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">through us</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">to heal, and to move in signs and wonders by the name of your holy Son, Jesus!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">As they prayed the earth shook beneath them, causing the building they were in to tremble.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">Each one of them was filled with the Holy Spirit, and they proclaimed the word of God with unrestrained boldness.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">All the believers were one in mind and heart. Selfishness was not a part of their community, for they shared everything they had with one another.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">The apostles gave powerful testimonies about the resurrection of the Lord Jesus, and great measures of grace</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">rested upon them all.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="5">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Now, a man named Ananias and his wife, Sapphira,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">likewise sold their farm.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">They conspired to secretly keep back for themselves a portion of the proceeds. So when Ananias brought the money to the apostles, it was only a portion of the entire sale.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">God revealed their secret to Peter</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">so he said to him, &apos;Ananias, why did you let Satan fill your heart and make you think you could lie to the Holy Spirit? You only pretended to give it all, yet you hid back part of the proceeds from the sale of your property to keep for yourselves.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Before you sold it, wasn&apos;t it yours to sell or to keep? And after you sold it, wasn&apos;t the money entirely at your disposal? How could you plot such a thing in your heart? You haven&apos;t lied to people; you&apos;ve lied to God!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">The moment Ananias heard those words, he fell over dead. Everyone was terrified when they heard what had happened.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Some young men came in and removed the body and buried him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Three hours later, his wife came into the room, with no clue what had happened to her husband.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Peter said to her, &apos;Tell me, were the two of you paid this amount for the sale of your land?&apos; Sapphira said, &apos;Yes, that&apos;s how much it was.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Peter told her, &apos;Why have you agreed together to test the Spirit of the Lord?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">I hear the footsteps of those who buried your husband at the door&apos;they&apos;re coming here to bury you too!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">At that moment she dropped dead at Peter&apos;s feet. When the young men came in, she was already dead, so they carried her out and buried her next to her husband.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">The entire church was seized with a powerful sense of the fear of God,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">which came over all who heard what had happened.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">The apostles performed many signs, wonders, and miracles among the people.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">And the believers were wonderfully united as they met regularly in the temple courts in the area known as Solomon&apos;s Porch. No one dared harm them,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">for everyone held them in high regard.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Continually more and more people believed in the Lord</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">and were added to their number&apos;great crowds of both men and women.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">In fact, when people knew Peter was going to walk by, they carried the sick out to the streets and laid them down on cots and mats, knowing the incredible power emanating from him would overshadow them</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">and heal them</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Great numbers of people swarmed into Jerusalem from the nearby villages. They brought with them the sick and those troubled by demons&apos;and everyone was healed!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">The high priest and his officials, who formed the party of the Sadducees, became extremely jealous over all that was happening,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">so they had the apostles arrested, placed in chains,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">and thrown into jail.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">But during the night, the Lord</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">sent an angel</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">who appeared before them</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">. He supernaturally opened their prison doors and brought the apostles outside.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">&apos;Go,&apos; the angel told them. &apos;Stand in the temple courts and preach the words that bring life!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">So early that morning they entered the temple courts and taught the people. The high priest and his officials,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">unaware of their supernatural release from prison</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">, convened the members of the supreme council.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">They sent for the apostles to be brought to them from prison.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">But when the officers came to the prison cell, it was empty! They returned to the council and informed them,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">&apos;We found the jail securely locked and the guards standing by their cell, but when we opened the door, there was no one inside!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">When the captain of the temple guard and the leading priests heard this report, they were perplexed and at a loss over what to make of it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">Someone came and informed them, &apos;The men you put in prison are out there standing in the temple courts, teaching the people!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">So the captain of the temple guard and his officers went to arrest them once again, but without using force, for they were afraid the people would stone them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">When they brought them before the council, the high priest demanded an explanation,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">saying, &apos;Didn&apos;t we strictly warn you that you were to never again teach in this name? But instead you have now filled all of Jerusalem with this doctrine and are committed to holding us responsible for this man&apos;s death!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">Peter and the apostles replied, &apos;We must listen to and obey God more than pleasing religious leaders.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">You had Jesus arrested and killed by crucifixion,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">but the God of our forefathers</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">has raised him up.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">He&apos;s the one God has exalted and seated at his right hand as our Savior and Champion.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">He is the provider of grace as the Redeemer of Israel.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">We are witnesses of these things,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">and so is the Holy Spirit, whom God freely gives to all who believe in him.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">When they heard this, they were infuriated and determined to murder them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">But a Pharisee named Gamaliel, a noted religious professor who was highly respected by all, stood up. He gave orders to send the apostles outside.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">Then he said to the council, &apos;Men of Israel, you need to be very careful about how you deal with these men.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">Some time ago there was a man named Theudas who rose up claiming to be somebody. He had a following of about four hundred men, but when he was killed, all of his followers were scattered, and nothing came of it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">&apos;After him, in the days of the census,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">another man rose up, Judas the Galilean, who got people to follow him in a revolt. He too perished, and all those who followed him were scattered.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">So in this situation, you should just leave these men to themselves. For if this plan or undertaking originates with men, it will fade away and come to nothing.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">But if this movement is of God, you won&apos;t be able to stop it. And you might discover that you were fighting God all along!&apos; Gamaliel&apos;s words convinced the council.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">So they brought the apostles back in and had them severely beaten. They ordered them never again to speak in the name of Jesus and then let them go.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">The apostles left there rejoicing, thrilled that God had considered them worthy to suffer disgrace for the name of Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">And nothing stopped them! They kept preaching every day in the temple courts and went from house to house, preaching the gospel of Jesus, God&apos;s Anointed One!</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="6">
			<VERS vnumber="1">During those days the number of Jesus&apos; followers kept multiplying greatly. But a complaint was brought against those who spoke Aramaic</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">by the Greek-speaking Jews,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">who felt their widows were being overlooked during the daily distribution of food.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">The twelve apostles called a meeting of all the believers and told them, &apos;It is not advantageous for us to be pulled away from the word of God to wait on tables.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">We want you to carefully select</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">from among yourselves seven godly men. Make sure they are honorable, full of the Holy Spirit and wisdom, and we will give them the responsibility of this crucial ministry of serving.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">That will enable us to give our full attention to prayer and preaching the word of God.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Everyone in the church loved this idea.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">So they chose seven men. One of them was Stephen,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">who was known as a man full of faith and overflowing with the Holy Spirit. Along with him they chose Philip, Prochorus, Nicanor, Timon, Parmenas, and Nicholas from Antioch,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">who had converted to Judaism.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">All seven stood before the apostles, who laid their hands on them and prayed for them,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">commissioning them to this ministry</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">God&apos;s word reigned supreme</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">and kept spreading. The number of Jesus&apos; followers in Jerusalem quickly grew and increased by the day. Even a great number of Jewish priests became believers and were obedient to the faith!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Stephen, who was a man full of grace and supernatural power, performed many astonishing signs and wonders and mighty miracles among the people.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">This upset some men belonging to a sect who called themselves the Men Set Free.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">They were Libyans,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Egyptians,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">and Turks. They all confronted Stephen to argue with him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">But the Holy Spirit gave Stephen remarkable wisdom to answer them. His words were prompted by the Holy Spirit, and they could not refute what he said.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">So the Men Set Free conspired in secret to find those who would bring false accusations against Stephen and lie about him by saying, &apos;We heard this man speak blasphemy against Moses and God.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">The Men Set Free agitated the crowd, the elders, and the religious scholars,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">then seized Stephen and forcefully took him before the supreme council.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">One after another, false witnesses stepped forward and accused Stephen, saying, &apos;This man never stops denigrating our temple and our Jewish law.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">For we have heard him teach that Jesus of Nazareth will destroy the temple and change the traditions and customs that Moses handed down to us.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Every member of the supreme council focused his gaze on Stephen, for right in front of their eyes,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">while being falsely accused</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">, his face glowed as though he had the face of an angel!</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="7">
			<VERS vnumber="1">The high priest asked, &apos;Are these accusations true?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Stephen replied, &apos;My fellow Jews and fathers, listen to me. The God of glory appeared</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">to our ancestor Abraham while he was living in Iraq</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">and before he moved to Haran</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">in Syria.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">God said to him, &apos;Go! Leave behind your country and your relatives. Begin your journey and come to the land that I will show you.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">&apos;So Abraham left southeastern Iraq</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">and began his journey. He settled in Haran and stayed there until his father passed away. Then God had him move to the land of Israel with only a promise.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Although God gave him no parcel of land he could call his own, not even a footprint,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">yet he promised Abraham that he and his descendants would one day have it all. And even though as yet Abraham had no child,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">God spoke with him and gave him this promise: &apos;Your descendants will live in a foreign land with a people who will make slaves of them and oppress them for four hundred years.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">But I will judge the nation that enslaves them, and your descendants will be set free to return to this land to serve and worship me.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">&apos;Then God entered into covenant with Abraham, which included the requirement of circumcision. So when he became the father of Isaac, he circumcised him eight days after his birth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">&apos;Isaac then became the father of Jacob, who was the father of our twelve patriarchs. Jacob&apos;s sons became jealous of their brother Joseph and sold him to be a slave in Egypt. But God&apos;s favor and blessing rested upon Joseph, and in time,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">God rescued him from all his oppression and granted him extraordinary favor before Pharaoh, the king of Egypt. Pharaoh appointed him as the overseer of his nation and even of his own palace.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">&apos;Then a devastating famine came over all of Egypt and Canaan, bringing great misery to the people, including our ancestors, who couldn&apos;t find food.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">But when Jacob learned that there was food in Egypt, he sent his sons, our ancestors, on their first trip to purchase grain for their family.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">On their second trip to Egypt, Joseph revealed his identity to his brothers,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">and because of this, Pharaoh learned about Joseph&apos;s family and where he came from.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">&apos;Joseph sent for his father, Jacob, and his entire family, a total of seventy-five people, to come and reside in Egypt.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Eventually, Jacob died there, along with all of his sons, our forefathers.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Their bones</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">were later carried back to the promised land and buried in Shechem, in the tomb Abraham had purchased for a sum of money from the sons of Hamor.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">&apos;The time drew near for God to fulfill the prophetic promise he had made to Abraham. Our Jewish people had increased greatly in number, multiplying many times over while in Egypt.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">&apos;Another</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">king,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">who had forgotten how Joseph had made their nation great</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">, arose to rule over Egypt.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">He was an abusive king who exploited our people with his smooth talk. With cruelty he forced our ancestors to give up their little boys as he committed infanticide!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">&apos;Then Moses came on the scene&apos;a child of divine beauty.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">His parents hid him from Pharaoh as long as they could to spare his life.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">After three months they could conceal him no longer,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">so they had to abandon him to his fate. But God arranged that Pharaoh&apos;s daughter would find him, take him home, and raise him as her own son.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">So Moses was fully trained in the royal courts and educated in the highest wisdom Egypt had to offer, until he arose as a powerful prince and an eloquent orator.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">&apos;When Moses turned forty, his heart was stirred for his people, the Israelites.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">One day he saw one of our people being violently mistreated, so he came to his rescue, and with his own hands Moses murdered the abusive Egyptian.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">Moses hoped that when the people realized how he had rescued one of their own, they would recognize him as their deliverer. How wrong he was!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">The next day he came upon two of our people engaged in a fist fight, and he tried to break it up by saying, &apos;Men, you are brothers! Why would you want to hurt each other?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">&apos;But the perpetrator pushed Moses aside and said, &apos;Who do you think you are? Who appointed you to be our ruler and judge?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">Are you going to kill me like you did the Egyptian yesterday?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">&apos;Shaken by this, Moses fled Egypt</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">and lived as an exile in the land of Midian, where he became the father of two sons.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">After forty years had passed, while he was in the desert near Mount Sinai, the Messenger of Yahweh</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">appeared to him in the midst of a flaming thorn bush.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">Moses was astonished and stunned by what he was seeing, so he drew closer to observe this marvel. Then the Lord Yahweh spoke to him out of the flames:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">&apos;I am the living God,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">the God of your ancestors. I am the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.&apos; &apos;Trembling in God&apos;s presence and overwhelmed with awe, Moses didn&apos;t even dare to look into the fire.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">&apos;Out of the flames the Lord Yahweh said to him: &apos;Take the sandals off your feet, for you are standing in the realm of holiness.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">I have watched and seen how my people have been mistreated in Egypt. I have heard their painful groaning, and now I have come down to set them free. So come to me, Moses, for I am sending you to Egypt to represent me.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">&apos;So God sent back to Egypt the man our people rejected and refused to recognize by saying, &apos;Who appointed you to be our ruler and judge?&apos; God sent this man back to be their ruler and deliverer, commissioned with the power of the messenger who appeared to him in the flaming thorn bush.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">This man brought the people out from their Egyptian bondage with many astonishing wonders and miracle signs&apos;miracles in Egypt, miracles at the Red Sea, and miracles during their forty-year journey through the wilderness.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">This is the same Moses who said to our ancestors, &apos;The Lord God</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">will raise up one from among you who will be a prophet to you, like I have been. Listen to everything he will say!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">&apos;Moses led the congregation in the wilderness</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">and</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">he spoke face-to-face</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">with the angel who spoke with him on the top of Mount Sinai. Along with our ancestors, he received the living oracles of God that were passed down to us.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">But our forefathers refused to obey. They pushed him away, and their hearts longed to return to Egypt.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">&apos;While Moses was on the mountain, our forefathers said to Aaron, &apos;Make us gods to lead us, because we don&apos;t know what has become of this Moses who brought us out of Egypt.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">&apos;So they made a god, an idol in the form of a bull calf. They offered sacrifices to it and celebrated with delight what their own hands had made.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">&apos;When God saw what they had done, he turned away from them and handed them over to the worship of the stars of heaven,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">as recorded in the prophetic writings: &apos;People of Israel, you failed to worship me when you offered animal sacrifices for forty years in the wilderness.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43">Instead you worshiped the god Moloch, and you carried his tabernacle, not mine. You worshiped your star-god, Rephan. You made idols with your hands and worshiped them instead of me. So now I will cast you into exile beyond Babylon.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44">&apos;God gave Moses the revelation of the pattern of the tabernacle of the testimony. By God&apos;s command, he made it exactly according to the specifications given to him for our ancestors in the wilderness.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45">The next generation received possession of it, and under Joshua&apos;s</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45">leadership they took possession of the land of the nations, which God drove out in front of them. The tabernacle was carried about until</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46">David found loving favor with God and prayed for a dwelling place for the God of Jacob,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="47">but it was Solomon who built him a house.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="48">&apos;However, the Most High God does not live in temples made by human hands, as the prophet said:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="49">&apos;Heaven is my throne room and the earth is but a footstool for my feet. How could you possibly build a house that could contain me?&apos; says the Lord Yahweh. &apos;And where could you find a place where I could live?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="50">Don&apos;t you know that it is my hands that have built my house, not yours?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="51">&apos;Why would you be so stubborn as to close your hearts and your ears to me? You are always opposing the Holy Spirit, just like your forefathers!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="52">Which prophet was not persecuted and murdered by your ancestors? Name just one! They killed them all&apos;even the ones who prophesied long ago of the coming of the Righteous One! Now you follow in their steps and have become his betrayers and murderers.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="53">You have been given the law by the visitation</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="53">of angels, but you have not obeyed it.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="54">When they heard these things, they were overtaken with violent rage filling their souls, and they gnashed their teeth at him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="55">But Stephen, overtaken with great faith,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="55">was full of the Holy Spirit. He fixed his gaze into the heavenly realm and saw the glory and splendor of God&apos;and Jesus, who stood up at the right hand of God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="56">&apos;Look!&apos; Stephen said. &apos;I can see the heavens opening and the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="56">to welcome me home</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="56">!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="57">His accusers covered their ears with their hands and screamed at the top of their lungs to drown out his voice.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="58">Then they pounced on him and threw him outside the city walls to stone him. His accusers, one by one, placed their outer garments at the feet of a young man named Saul of Tarsus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="59">As they hurled stone after stone at him, Stephen prayed, &apos;Our Lord Jesus, accept my spirit into your presence.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="60">He crumpled to his knees and shouted in a loud voice, &apos;Our Lord, don&apos;t hold this sin against them.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="60">And then he died.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="8">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Now, Saul agreed to be an accomplice to Stephen&apos;s stoning and participated in his execution. From that day on, a great persecution of the church in Jerusalem began. All the believers scattered into the countryside of Judea and among the Samaritans, except the apostles who remained behind in Jerusalem.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">God-fearing men gave Stephen a proper burial and mourned greatly over his death.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Then Saul mercilessly persecuted the church of God, going from house to house into the homes of believers to arrest both men and women and drag them off to prison.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Although the believers were scattered by persecution, they preached the wonderful news of the word of God wherever they went.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Philip traveled to a Samaritan city</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">and preached to them the wonderful news of the Anointed One.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">The crowds were eager to receive</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Philip&apos;s message and were persuaded by the many miracles and wonders he performed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Many demon-possessed people were set free and delivered as evil spirits came out of them with loud screams and shrieks, and many who were lame and paralyzed were also healed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">This resulted in an uncontainable joy filling the city!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Now, there was a man who lived there who was steeped in sorcery. For some time he had astounded the people of Samaria with his magic, boasting to be someone great.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Everyone, from the least to the greatest among them, was dazzled by his sorcery,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">saying, &apos;This man is the greatest wizard of all! The divine power of God walks among us!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">For many years everyone was in awe of him because of his astonishing displays of the magic arts.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">But as Philip preached the wonderful news of God&apos;s kingdom realm, and the name of Jesus the Anointed One, many believed his message and were baptized, both men and women.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Even Simon believed and was baptized! Wherever Philip went, Simon was right by his side, astounded by all the miracles, signs, and enormous displays of power that he witnessed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">When the apostles in Jerusalem heard that the Samaritans had accepted God&apos;s message of life, they sent Peter and John</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">to pray over them so that they would receive the Holy Spirit.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">For they had only been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus and were yet to have the Holy Spirit fall upon them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">As soon as Peter and John arrived, they laid their hands on the Samaritan believers, one after another, and the Holy Spirit fell and filled each one of them!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">When Simon saw how the Holy Spirit was released through the laying on of the apostles&apos; hands, he approached them and offered them money,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">saying, &apos;I want this power too. I&apos;m willing to pay you for the anointing</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">that you have, so that I also can lay my hands on everyone to receive the Holy Spirit.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Peter rebuked him and said, &apos;Your money will go with you to destruction! How could you even think that you could purchase God&apos;s supernatural gift with money?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">You will never have this gift or take part in this ministry,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">for your heart is not right with God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Repent this moment for allowing such wickedness to fill you. Plead with the Lord that perhaps he would forgive you the treachery of your heart.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">For I discern that jealous envy</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">has poisoned you and binds you as a captive to sin.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">Simon begged, &apos;Peter, please pray to God for me. Plead with him so that nothing you just said over me may come to pass!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">After Peter and John had testified and taught the word of God in that city, they returned to Jerusalem, stopping at many Samaritan villages along the way to preach the hope of the gospel.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">Then the Lord&apos;s angel said to Philip, &apos;Now go south from Jerusalem on the desert road to Gaza.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">He left immediately on his assignment. Along the way he encountered an Ethiopian who believed in the God of the Jews , who was the minister of finance for Candace, queen of Ethiopia. He was on his way home from worshiping God in Jerusalem.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">As he rode along in his chariot, he was reading from the scroll of Isaiah.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">The Holy Spirit said to Philip, &apos;Go and walk alongside the chariot.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">So Philip ran to catch up. As he drew closer he overheard the man reading from the scroll of Isaiah the prophet. Philip asked him, &apos;Sir, do you understand what you&apos;re reading?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">The man answered, &apos;How can I possibly make sense of this without someone explaining it to me?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">So he invited Philip up into his chariot to sit with him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">The portion from Isaiah he was reading was this: He was led away to the slaughter like a lamb to be offered. He was like a lamb that is silent before those who sheared him&apos; he never even opened his mouth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">In his lowliness justice was stripped away from him. And who could fully express his struggles? For his life was taken from the earth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">The Ethiopian asked Philip, &apos;Please, can you tell me who the prophet is speaking of? Is it himself or another man?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">Philip started with this passage and shared with him the wonderful message of Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">As they were traveling down the road, the man said, &apos;Look, here&apos;s a pool of water. Why don&apos;t I get baptized right now?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">Philip replied, &apos;If you believe with all your heart, I&apos;ll baptize you.&apos; The man answered, &apos;I believe that Jesus is the Anointed One, the Son of God.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">The Ethiopian stopped his chariot, and they went down into the water</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">and Philip baptized him.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="9">
			<VERS vnumber="1">During those days, Saul, full of angry threats and rage,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">wanted to murder the disciples of the Lord Jesus. So he went to ask the high priest</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">and requested a letter of authorization he could take to the Jewish leaders in Damascus,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">requesting their cooperation in finding and arresting any who were followers of the Way.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Saul wanted to capture all of the believers he found, both men and women, and drag them as prisoners back to Jerusalem.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">So he obtained the authorization</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">and left for Damascus. Just outside the city, a brilliant light flashing from heaven suddenly exploded all around him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Falling to the ground, he heard a booming voice say to him,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">&apos;Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Saul stood to his feet, and even though his eyes were open he could see nothing&apos;he was blind. So the men had to take him by the hand and lead him into Damascus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">For three days he didn&apos;t eat or drink and couldn&apos;t see a thing.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Living in Damascus was a believer named Ananias. The Lord spoke to him in a vision, calling his name.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">&apos;Ananias.&apos; &apos;Yes, Lord,&apos; Ananias answered.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">&apos;But Lord,&apos; Ananias replied, &apos;many have told me about his terrible persecution of those in Jerusalem who are devoted to you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">In fact, the high priest has authorized him to seize and imprison all those in Damascus who call on your name.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">The Lord Yahweh</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">answered him,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">&apos;Arise and go! I have chosen this man to be my special messenger.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">He will be brought before kings, before many nations, and before the Jewish people to give them the revelation of who I am.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">And I will show him how much he is destined to suffer</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">because of his passion for me.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Ananias left and found the house where Saul was staying. He went inside and laid hands on him, saying, &apos;Saul, my brother, the Lord Jesus, who appeared to you on the road, has sent me to pray for you so that you might see again and be filled to overflowing with the Holy Spirit.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">All at once, the crusty substance that was over Saul&apos;s eyes disappeared and he could see perfectly. Immediately, he got up and was baptized.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">After eating a meal,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">his strength returned.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Within the hour</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">he was in the synagogues, preaching about Jesus and proclaiming, &apos;Jesus is the Son of God!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Those who heard him were astonished, saying among themselves, &apos;Isn&apos;t this the Saul who furiously persecuted those in Jerusalem who called on the name of Jesus? Didn&apos;t he come here with permission from the high priest to drag them off and take them as prisoners?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Saul&apos;s power increased greatly as he became more and more proficient in proving that Jesus was the anointed Messiah. Saul remained there for several days with the disciples, even though it agitated the Jews of Damascus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">As time passed, the Jews plotted together to kill Saul,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">but it was revealed to him what they were about to do. They closely guarded the gates of the city and tracked his every movement so they could kill him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">But during the night, some of Saul&apos;s converts helped him escape by lowering him down through an opening in the wall, hiding him in a woven basket.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">When Saul arrived in Jerusalem, he attempted to introduce himself to the fellowship of the believers, but everyone was afraid of him because they doubted he was a true disciple.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">Barnabas</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">came to his defense and brought him before the apostles. Saul shared with them his supernatural experience of seeing the Lord, who spoke with him on the road to Damascus. Barnabas also told them how boldly Saul preached throughout the city in Jesus&apos; mighty name.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">Then they accepted him as a brother and he remained with them, joining them wherever they went in Jerusalem, boldly preaching in the power and authority of Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">He openly debated with some of the Jews who had adopted the Greek culture,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">yet they were secretly plotting to murder him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">When the believers discovered their scheme, they smuggled him out of the city and took him to Caesarea and then sent him on to Tarsus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">After this, the church all over Judea, Galilee, and Samaria experienced a season of peace.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">The congregations grew larger and larger, with the believers being empowered and encouraged by the Holy Spirit. They worshiped God in wonder and awe,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">and walked in the fear of the Lord.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">As Peter was ministering</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">from place to place, he visited God&apos;s devoted ones in the village of Lydda.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">He met a man there named Aeneas</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">who had been paralyzed and bedridden for eight years.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">Peter said to him, &apos;Aeneas, Jesus the Anointed One instantly and divinely heals you. Now, get up and make your bed.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">All at once he stood to his feet. And when all the people of Lydda and Sharon saw him, they became believers in the Lord.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">Now, there was a follower of Jesus who lived in Joppa. Her Aramaic name, Tabitha, means &apos;gazelle.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">She lived her life doing kind things for others and serving the poor.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">But then she became very ill and died. After the disciples prepared her body for burial,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">they laid her in an upstairs room.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">When the believers heard that Peter was nearby in Lydda, they sent two men with an urgent message for him to come without delay.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">So Peter went with them back to Joppa, and upon arriving they led him to the upper room. There were many widows standing next to Peter, weeping. One after another showed him the tunics and other garments that Tabitha had made to bless others.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">Peter made them all leave the room.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">Then he knelt down and prayed. Turning to the dead body, he said, &apos;Tabitha, rise up!&apos; At once she opened her eyes, and seeing Peter, she sat up.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">He took her by the hand and helped her to her feet. Then he called for the believers and all the widows to come and see that she was alive!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">The news spread all over the city of Joppa, and many believed in the Lord.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43">Peter remained in Joppa for several more days as a guest at the house of Simon the tanner.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="10">
			<VERS vnumber="1">At that time there was a Roman military officer, Cornelius, who was in charge of one hundred men stationed in Caesarea. He was the captain of the Italian regiment,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">a devout man of extraordinary character who worshiped God and prayed regularly, together with all his family. He also had a heart for the poor and gave generously to help them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">One afternoon about three o&apos;clock, he had an open vision and saw the angel of God appear right in front of him, calling out his name, &apos;Cornelius!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Startled, he was overcome with fear by the sight of the angel. He asked, &apos;What do you want, Lord?&apos; The angel said, &apos;All of your prayers and your generosity to the poor have ascended before God as an eternal offering.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Now, send some men to Joppa at once. Have them find a man named Simon the Rock,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">who is staying as a guest in the home of Simon the tanner, whose house is by the sea.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">After the angel left, Cornelius called for two of his servants and a trusted, godly soldier who was his personal attach&apos;.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">He explained to them everything that had just happened and sent them off to Joppa.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">The next day around noon, as Cornelius&apos; men were approaching Joppa, Peter went up to the flat roof</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">of the house to pray.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">He was hungry and wanted to eat, but while lunch was being prepared he fell into a trance and entered into another realm.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">As the heavenly realm opened up, he saw something resembling a large linen tablecloth that descended from above, being let down to the earth by its four corners.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">As it floated down he saw that it held many kinds of four-footed animals, reptiles, and wild birds.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">A voice said to him, &apos;Peter, go and prepare them to be eaten.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Peter replied, &apos;There&apos;s no way I could do that, Lord, for I&apos;ve never eaten anything forbidden or impure</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">according to our Jewish laws</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">The voice spoke again. &apos;Nothing is unclean if God declares it to be clean.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">The vision was repeated three times.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Then suddenly the linen sheet was snatched back up into heaven.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Peter was so stunned by the vision that he couldn&apos;t stop wondering about what all it meant. Meanwhile, Cornelius&apos; men had learned where Peter was staying and at that same moment were standing outside the gate.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">They called out to those in the house, &apos;Is this where Simon, the Rock,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">is staying?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Peter went downstairs to the men and said, &apos;I believe I&apos;m the one you&apos;re looking for. What brings you here?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">They answered, &apos;We serve Cornelius, a Roman military captain, who sent us to find you. He is a devout man of the highest integrity who worships</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">God and is respected throughout the Jewish community. He was divinely instructed through the appearance of an angel to summon you to his home and to listen to the message that you would bring him.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">Peter invited them to stay for the night as his guests. The next morning they departed, accompanied by some of the believers from Joppa.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">The next day they arrived in Caesarea, where Cornelius was waiting anxiously for them and had gathered together all of his relatives and close friends.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">The moment Peter walked in the door, Cornelius fell at his feet to worship him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">But Peter pulled him to his feet and said, &apos;Stand up, for I&apos;m only a man and no different from you.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">They talked together and then went inside, where Peter found a large gathering</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">waiting to hear his words</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">Peter said to them, &apos;You all know that it is against the Jewish laws for me to associate with or even visit the home of one who is not a Jew. Yet God has shown me that I should never view anyone as inferior</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">or ritually unclean.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">So when you sent for me, I came without objection.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">Now, may I ask why you sent for me?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">Cornelius replied, &apos;Four days ago I was fasting</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">and praying here in my home at this very hour, three o&apos;clock in the afternoon, when a man in glistening clothing suddenly appeared in front of my eyes.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">He said, &apos;Cornelius, God has heard your prayers. Your generosity to the poor has been recorded and remembered in God&apos;s presence.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">However, you must send for a man named Simon, the Rock, who is staying in Joppa as a guest of Simon the tanner, who lives by the sea.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">So I immediately sent my men to bring you here&apos;and you were kind enough to come. And now, here we are, all of us in God&apos;s presence, anxious to hear the message that God has put into your heart to share with us.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">Peter said, &apos;Now I know for certain that God doesn&apos;t show favoritism with people</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">but treats everyone on the same basis</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">It makes no difference what race of people one belongs to. If they show deep reverence for God, and are committed to doing what&apos;s right, they are acceptable before him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">God sent his word to the Jewish people first,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">announcing the wonderful news of hope and peace</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">through Jesus, the Anointed One, the Lord of all.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">You are well aware of all that began in Galilee and spread throughout the land of Israel immediately after John preached his message of baptism.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">&apos;Jesus of Nazareth was anointed by God with the Holy Spirit and with great power. He did wonderful things for others and divinely healed all who were under the tyranny of the devil,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">for God had anointed him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">We apostles were eyewitnesses to all the miracles</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">that he performed throughout the land of Israel. Finally, in Jerusalem, he was crucified on a cross,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">but God raised him from the dead three days later, allowing him to be seen openly.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">He didn&apos;t appear to everyone, but he appeared to us, his chosen witnesses. He actually ate and drank with us</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">after he rose from the dead!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">&apos;Jesus ordered us to preach and warn the people</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">that God had appointed him to be the judge of the living and the dead.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43">And not only us</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43">, but all of the prophets agree in their writings that everyone who believes in him receives complete forgiveness</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43">of sins through the power of his name.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44">While Peter was speaking, the Holy Spirit cascaded over all those listening to his message.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45">The Jewish brothers who had accompanied Peter were astounded that the gift of the Holy Spirit was poured out on people who weren&apos;t Jews,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46">for they heard them speaking in supernaturally given languages and passionately praising God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="47">Peter said, &apos;How could anyone object to these people being baptized? For they have received the Holy Spirit just as we have.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="48">So he instructed them to be baptized in the power of the name of Jesus, the Anointed One. After their baptism, they asked Peter to stay with them for a few more days.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="11">
			<VERS vnumber="1">The news traveled fast and soon reached the apostles and the believers living in Judea that non-Jewish people were also receiving God&apos;s</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">message of new life</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">When Peter finally arrived in Jerusalem, the Jewish believers called him to task, saying,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">&apos;Why did you stay in the home of people who aren&apos;t Jewish? You even ate your meals with them!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Peter explained what had happened, saying,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">&apos;One day when I was in the city of Joppa, while I was praying I fell into an ecstatic trance and I went into another realm.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">I saw in a vision something like a linen tablecloth descending out of heaven, being let down by its four corners, and it got close to me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">As I examined it I saw many four-footed animals, wild animals, reptiles, and wild birds.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Then I heard a voice say to me, &apos;Get up, Peter. Kill and eat them.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">&apos;I said, &apos;I can&apos;t do that, Lord! For I&apos;ve never eaten anything that is forbidden or impure according to our Jewish laws.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">&apos;The voice spoke to me again, saying, &apos;Nothing is unclean if God declares it to be clean.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">&apos;The vision repeated itself three times. Then suddenly the linen sheet was snatched back up into heaven.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">At that moment three men from Caesarea, who had been sent for me, approached the house where I was staying.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">The Spirit told me to accompany them with no questions asked. These six brothers here with me made the trip, and we entered into the home of the man who had sent for me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">He shared with us about the angel who appeared to him and told him to send messengers to Joppa to find Simon, the Rock. The angel had told him,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">&apos;He will tell you and your family the message of how you can be saved!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">&apos;Shortly after I began to speak, the Holy Spirit was poured out upon them, just like what happened to us at the beginning.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">And I remembered the words the Lord had told us:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">&apos;John immersed you in water, but you will be immersed in the Holy Spirit.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">So I concluded that if God is pleased to give them the same gift of the Holy Spirit that he gave us after they believed in the Lord Jesus Christ, who am I to stand in the way of God?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">When they heard this, their objections were put to rest and they all glorified God, saying, &apos;Look what God has done! He&apos;s giving the gift of repentance that leads to life to people who aren&apos;t even Jews.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Because of the persecution triggered by Stephen&apos;s death in Jerusalem, many of the believers were scattered. Some reached as far as the coast of Lebanon,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">the island of Cyprus, and Antioch of Syria, but they were still only preaching the word to Jews.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">However, some of the believers from Cyprus and Cyrene,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">who had come to Antioch in Syria,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">preached to the non-Jews living there, proclaiming the message of salvation in the Lord Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">The mighty power of the Lord was with them as they ministered, and a large number of people believed and turned their hearts to the Lord.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">News of what was happening in Antioch reached the church of Jerusalem, so the apostles sent Barnabas to Antioch as their emissary.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">When he got there and witnessed for himself God&apos;s marvelous grace, he was enthused and overjoyed. He encouraged</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">the believers to remain faithful and cling to the Lord with passionate hearts.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">Barnabas was a good man,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">full of the Spirit of holiness, and he exuded a life of faith. Because of his ministry even more crowds of people were brought to the Lord!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">Barnabas left for Tarsus to find Saul and bring him back to Antioch.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">Together Saul and Barnabas ministered there for a full year, equipping the growing church and teaching the vast number of new converts. It was in Antioch that the followers of Jesus were first revealed as &apos;anointed ones.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">At that time there were prophets in the church of Jerusalem, and some of them came to Antioch.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">One of them, named Agabus, stood up in one of the meetings and prophesied by the Holy Spirit that a severe famine was about to come over Israel. (This prophecy was fulfilled during the reign of Claudius Caesar.)</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">So they determined that each believer, according to his or her ability, would give an offering to send as relief to the brothers living in Judea.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">They set aside the gifts and entrusted the funds to Barnabas and Saul to take to the elders</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">of the church in Jerusalem.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="12">
			<VERS vnumber="1">During this period King Herod</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">incited persecution against the church, causing great harm to the believers.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">He even had the apostle Jacob,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">John&apos;s brother, beheaded.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">The church went into a season of intense intercession,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">asking God to free him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">The night before Herod planned to bring him to trial, he made sure that Peter was securely bound with two chains. Peter was sound asleep between two soldiers, with additional guards stationed outside his cell door,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">when all at once an angel of the Lord appeared, filling his prison cell with a brilliant light. The angel struck Peter on the side</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">to awaken him and said, &apos;Hurry up! Let&apos;s go!&apos; Instantly the chains fell off his wrists.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">The angel told him, &apos;Get dressed. Put on your sandals, bring your cloak, and follow me.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Peter quickly left the cell and followed the angel, even though he thought it was only a dream or a vision, for it seemed unreal&apos;he couldn&apos;t believe it was really happening!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">They walked unseen past the first guard post and then the second before coming to the iron gate that leads to the city&apos;and the gate swung open all by itself right in front of them! They went out into the city and were walking down a narrow street when all of a sudden the angel disappeared.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">That&apos;s when Peter realized that he wasn&apos;t having a dream! He said to himself, &apos;This is really happening! The Lord sent his angel to rescue me from the clutches of Herod and from what the Jewish leaders planned to do to me.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">When he realized this, he decided to go to the home of Mary</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">and her son John Mark. The house was filled with people praying.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">When he knocked on the door to the courtyard, a young servant girl named Rose</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">got up to see who it was.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">When she recognized Peter&apos;s voice, she was so excited that she forgot to open the door, but ran back inside the house to announce, &apos;Peter is standing outside!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">&apos;Are you crazy?&apos; they said to her. But when she kept insisting, they answered, &apos;Well, it must be his angel.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Meanwhile, Peter was still outside, knocking on the door. When they finally opened it, they were shocked to find Peter standing there.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">He signaled for them to be quiet as he shared with them the miraculous way the Lord brought him out of prison. Before he left he said, &apos;Make sure you let Jacob</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">and all of the other believers know what has happened.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">At the first sign of daylight, the prison guards were in a tremendous uproar because of Peter&apos;s disappearance. Herod ordered a thorough search for him, but no one could find him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">After he interrogated the guards, he ordered them executed. Then Herod left the province of Judea for Caesarea and stayed there for a period of time.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Now, during those days, Herod was engaged in a violent dispute with the people of Tyre and Sidon.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">So they sent a united delegation to Caesarea to appeal to him and reconcile their differences</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">with the king, for Herod controlled their food supply. First they enlisted the support of his trusted personal assistant, Blastus, who secured them an appointment with the king.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">On the chosen day, Herod came before them, arrayed in his regal robes. Sitting on his elevated throne, he delivered a stirring public address to the people.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">At its conclusion the people gave him a round of applause. The crowd shouted, &apos;These are the words of a god, not a man!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">Immediately, an angel of the Lord struck Herod with a sickness, an infestation of worms, because he accepted the people&apos;s worship and didn&apos;t give the glory to God, and he died.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">But the hope of God&apos;s kingdom</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">kept spreading and multiplying everywhere!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">After Barnabas and Saul</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">had delivered the charitable offering for relief</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">, they left Jerusalem, bringing with them a disciple named Mark (who was also known as John).</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="13">
			<VERS vnumber="1">In the church at Antioch there were a number of prophets and teachers of the Word, including Barnabas, Simeon from Niger,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">Lucius the Libyan, Manean (the childhood companion of King Herod Antipas),</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">and Saul.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">While they were worshiping as priests</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">before the Lord in prayer and fasting, the Holy Spirit said,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">&apos;I have called Barnabas and Saul to do an important work for me. Now, release them</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">to go and fulfill it.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">So after they had fasted and prayed, they laid hands on them and sent them off.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">From there they crossed the island as far as Paphos,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">where they encountered a Jewish false prophet, a sorcerer named Elymas,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">who also went by the name of &apos;son of Jesus.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">He had gained influence as the spiritual advisor to the regional governor, Sergius Paulus, considered by many to be a wise and intelligent leader. The governor requested a meeting with Barnabas and Saul because he wanted to hear the message of God&apos;s word.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">But Elymas, whose name means &apos;sorcerer,&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">stood up against them and tried to prevent the governor from believing their message.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Saul, also known as Paul,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">stared into his eyes and rebuked him. Filled with the Holy Spirit, he said,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">&apos;You son of the devil!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">You are full of every form of fraud and deceit and an enemy of all that is right. When will you stop perverting the truth of God into lies?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">At this very moment the hand of God&apos;s judgment comes down upon you and you will be blind&apos;so blind you won&apos;t even be able to see the light of the sun.&apos; As Paul spoke these words, a shadowy mist and darkness came over the sorcerer, leaving him blind and groping about, begging someone to lead him around by the hand.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">When the governor witnessed this, he believed and was awestruck by the power of the message of the Lord.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Paul and his companions sailed from the Cyprus port of Paphos to Perga in southern Turkey.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">John left them</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">there and returned to Jerusalem</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">as they journeyed on to the city of Antioch in the region of Pisidia. On the Sabbath they went into the synagogue and took their seats.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">After the reading from the scrolls of the books of Moses and the prophets, the leader of the meeting</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">sent Paul and Barnabas a message, saying, &apos;Brothers, do you have a word of encouragement to share with us? If so, please feel free to give it.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Paul stood and motioned that he had something to say. He said, &apos;Listen, all of you Jews and non-Jews who worship God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">The God of Israel divinely chose our ancestors to be his people. While they were enslaved in Egypt, he made them great, both in numbers and in strength, until he unveiled his mighty power and led them out of bondage.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">For nearly forty years, he nourished them in the wilderness.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">He was the one who destroyed the seven nations inhabiting the land of Canaan</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">and afterward gave the land to his people as their inheritance.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">This took about four hundred and fifty years. &apos;Then God raised up deliverers for the people until the time of the prophet Samuel.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">The people craved for a king, so God gave them one from the tribe of Benjamin: Saul, the son of Kish, who ruled for forty years.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">After removing him, God raised up David to be king, for God said of him, &apos;I have found in David, son of Jesse, a man who always pursues my heart</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">and will accomplish all that I have destined him to do.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">&apos;From David&apos;s lineage God brought Israel a Savior, just as he promised.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">So before Jesus appeared, John preached the message of a baptism of repentance</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">to prepare all of Israel.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">As John was about to finish his mission, he said repeatedly, &apos;If you think that I am the one to come, you&apos;re mistaken. He will come after me, and I don&apos;t even deserve to stoop down and untie his sandals!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">&apos;Fellow Jews, Abraham&apos;s descendants, and all those among you who worship and reverence God, this message of life</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">has been sent for us all to hear.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">But the people of Jerusalem and their leaders didn&apos;t realize who he was, nor did they understand the prophecies written of him. Yet they fulfilled those very prophecies, which they read week after week in their meetings, by condemning him to death.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">Even though they could come up with no legal grounds for the death sentence, they pleaded with Pilate to have him executed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">And they did to him all that was prophesied they would do. &apos;Then they took him down from the cross and laid him in a tomb.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">But God raised him from the dead!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">And for many days afterward he appeared on numerous occasions to his disciples who knew him well and had followed him from Galilee to Jerusalem. Those disciples are now his witnesses,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">telling the people the truth about him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">&apos;So here we are to share with you some wonderful news! The promise God made to our forefathers</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">has now been fulfilled for us, their children. For God has raised Jesus from the dead, as it says in Psalms: &apos;Today I reveal you as my Son, and I as your Father.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">&apos;God had promised to not let him decay in the tomb or face destruction again, so God raised him from the dead. He gave this promise in the Psalms: &apos;I will give to you what I gave to David: Faithful mercies that you can trust.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">&apos;He explains it further in another Psalm: &apos;You will not allow your holy one to experience bodily decay.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">&apos;This cannot be a reference to David, for after he passionately served God&apos;s purpose for his generation, he died. He was buried with his ancestors and his body experienced decay.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">But the one whom God raised from the dead has never experienced corruption in any form.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">&apos;So listen, friends! Through this Jesus, the forgiveness</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">of sins is offered to you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">Everyone who believes in him is set free from sin and guilt&apos;something the law of Moses had no power to do.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">So be very careful that what the prophets warned about does not happen to you:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">&apos;Be amazed and in agony, you scoffers! For in your day I will do something so wonderful that when I perform mighty deeds among you, you won&apos;t even believe that it was I who did it!&apos; &apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">As Paul and Barnabas started to leave, the people pleaded with them to share more about these things on the next Sabbath day.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43">When the meeting had finally broken up, many of those in attendance, both Jews and converts to Judaism, tagged along with Paul and Barnabas, who continued to persuade them to go deeper in their understanding of God&apos;s grace.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44">The following week, nearly everyone in the city gathered to hear the word of God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45">When the Jewish leaders saw the size of the crowds, vicious jealousy filled their hearts and they rose up to oppose what Paul was teaching. They insulted him</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45">and argued with him over everything he said.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46">Yet Paul and Barnabas did not back down. Filled with courage, they boldly replied, &apos;We were compelled to bring God&apos;s message</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46">first to you Jews. But seeing you&apos;ve rejected this message and refuse to embrace eternal life,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46">we will focus instead on the nations and offer it to them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="47">This will fulfill what the Lord has commanded us: &apos;I have destined you to become a beacon light for the nations and release salvation to the ends of the earth!&apos; &apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="48">When the non-Jewish people in the crowd heard these words, they were thrilled and they honored</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="48">the word of the Lord. All who believed that they were destined to experience eternal life received the message.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="49">God&apos;s word spread like wildfire throughout the entire region.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="50">The Jewish leaders stirred up a violent mob against Paul and Barnabas, including many prominent and wealthy people of the city. They persecuted them and ran them out of town.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="51">As they left, they shook the dust off their feet as a sign of protest against them, and they went on to the city of Iconium.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="52">They left the new converts in Antioch overflowing with the joy of the Holy Spirit.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="14">
			<VERS vnumber="1">When Paul and Barnabas arrived at Iconium, the same thing happened there. They went, as they always did, to the synagogue and preached to the people with such power that a large crowd of both Jews and non-Jews believed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Some of the Jews refused to believe, and they began to poison the minds</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">of the non-Jews to discredit the believers.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Yet Paul and Barnabas stayed there for a long time, preaching boldly and fearlessly about the Lord.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Many trusted in the Lord, for he backed up his message</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">of grace</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">with miracles, signs, and wonders performed by the apostles.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">The people of the city were split over the issue. Some sided with the apostles, and others with the Jews</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">who refused to believe</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Eventually, all the opposition factions came together, with their leaders devising a plot</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">to harm Paul and Barnabas and stone them to death.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">When the apostles learned about this,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">they escaped to the region of Lyconia,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">to the cities of Lystra</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">and Derbe</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">and the nearby villages.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">And they continued to preach the hope of the gospel.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">In Lystra, Paul and Barnabas encountered a man who from birth had never walked, for he was crippled in his feet.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">He listened carefully to Paul as he preached. All of a sudden,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Paul discerned that this man had faith in his heart to be healed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">So he shouted, &apos;You! In the name of our Lord Jesus,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">stand up on your feet!&apos; The man instantly jumped to his feet, stood for the first time in his life, and walked!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">When the crowds saw the miracle Paul had done, they shouted in their own language,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">&apos;The gods have come down to us as men!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">They addressed Barnabas as &apos;Zeus&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">and Paul as &apos;Hermes,&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">because he was the spokesman.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Now, outside of the city stood the temple of Zeus. The priest of the temple, in order to honor Paul and Barnabas, brought bulls with wreaths of flowers draped on them to the gates of the courtyard where they were staying.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">The crowds clamored to offer them as sacrifices to the apostles. He even brought flower wreaths as crowns to place on their heads.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">When the apostles</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">understood what was happening, they were mortified and tore their clothes as a sign of dismay. They rushed into the crowd and shouted,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">&apos;People, what are you doing? We&apos;re only weak human beings like everyone else. This is why we&apos;ve come to tell you the good news, so that you would turn away from these worthless</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">myths</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">and turn to the living God. He is the Creator of all things: the earth, the heavens, the sea, and everything they contain.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">In previous generations he allowed the nations to pursue their own ways,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">yet he has never left himself without clear evidence of his goodness. For he blesses us with rain from heaven and seasons of fruitful harvests, and he nourishes us with food to meet our needs. He satisfies our lives, and euphoria</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">fills our hearts.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Even after saying these things, they were barely able to restrain the people from offering sacrifices to them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Some of the Jews who had opposed Paul and Barnabas in Antioch and Iconium arrived and stirred up the crowd against them. They stoned Paul and dragged his body outside the city and left him for dead.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">When the believers encircled Paul&apos;s body, he miraculously stood up!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Paul stood and immediately went back into the city. The next day he left with Barnabas for Derbe.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">After preaching the wonderful news of the gospel there and winning a large number of followers to Jesus, they retraced their steps and revisited Lystra, Iconium, and Antioch.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">At each place they went, they strengthened the lives of the believers</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">and encouraged them to go deeper in their faith. And they taught them, &apos;It is necessary for us to enter into the realm of God&apos;s kingdom, because that&apos;s the only way we will endure our many trials and persecutions.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">Paul and Barnabas ordained leaders, known as elders, from among the congregations in every church they visited.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">After prayer and fasting, they publicly committed them into the care and protection of the Lord of their faith.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">After passing through different regions of central Turkey,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">they went to the city of Perga, preaching the life-giving message of the Lord.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">Afterward they journeyed down to the coast at Antalya,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">and from there they sailed back to Antioch. With their mission complete, they returned to the church where they had originally been sent out as missionaries, for it was in Antioch where they had been handed over to God&apos;s powerful grace.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">When they arrived in Antioch, they gathered the church together and shared with them all of the wonderful works God had done through them and how God had opened the door of faith for the non-Jews to enter in.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">Afterward, Paul and Barnabas stayed there for a long time in fellowship with the believers.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="15">
			<VERS vnumber="1">While Paul and Barnabas were in Antioch,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">some false teachers</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">came from Judea to trouble the believers. They taught, &apos;Unless you are circumcised, as the law of Moses requires, you cannot be saved.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">This sparked a fierce argument between the false teachers and Paul and Barnabas. So the church appointed a delegation of believers, including Paul and Barnabas, to go to Jerusalem to meet with the apostles and elders of the church and resolve this issue.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">So the church sent them on their way. As they passed through Lebanon and Samaria, they stopped to share with the believers how God was converting many from among the non-Jewish people. Hearing this report brought great joy to all the churches.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">When they finally arrived in Jerusalem, Paul and Barnabas were welcomed by the church, the apostles, and the elders. They explained to them everything God had done among them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">But some of the believers who were of the religious group called &apos;separated ones&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">were insistent, saying, &apos;We must continue the custom of circumcision and require that the people keep</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">the law of Moses.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">So the apostles and elders met privately to discuss the matter further.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">After a lengthy debate, Peter rose to his feet and said to them, &apos;Brothers, you know how God has chosen me</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">from the beginning to preach the wonderful news of the gospel to the non-Jewish nations.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">God, who knows the hearts of every person, confirmed this when he gave them the Holy Spirit, just like he has given the Spirit to us.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">So now, not one thing separates us as Jews and gentiles, for when they believe he makes their hearts pure.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">So why on earth would you now</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">limit God&apos;s grace</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">by placing a yoke of religious duties on the shoulders of the believers that neither we nor our ancestors have been able to bear?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Don&apos;t you believe that we are introduced to eternal life through the grace of our Lord Jesus&apos;the same grace that has brought these people new life?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Everyone became silent and listened carefully as Paul and Barnabas shared with the council at length about the signs and wonders and miracles God had worked through them while ministering to the non-Jewish people.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">When they had finished, Jacob took the floor and said, &apos;Ladies and gentlemen, listen.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Peter has explained thoroughly that God has determined to win a people for himself from among the non-Jewish nations.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">And the prophet&apos;s words are fulfilled:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">&apos;After these things I will return to you and raise up the tabernacle of David that has fallen into ruin. I will restore and rebuild what David experienced</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">so that all of humanity will be able to encounter the Lord including the gentiles whom I have called to be my very own,&apos; says the Lord.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">&apos;For I have made known my works from eternity!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">&apos;So, in my judgment, we should not add any unnecessary burden upon the non-Jewish converts who are turning to God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">We will go to them as apostles</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">and teach them to be set free from offering sacrifices to idols, sexual immorality, and eating anything strangled or with any blood.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">For many generations these words of Moses have been proclaimed every Sabbath day in the synagogues.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">The apostles and elders and the church of Jerusalem chose delegates to go to Antioch in Syria. They chose Judas, called Barsabbas, and Silas, both leaders in the church, to accompany Paul and Barnabas.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">They sent with them this letter: &apos;Greetings from the apostles and pastors, and from your fellow believers&apos;to our non-Jewish brothers and sisters living in Antioch in Syria and the nearby regions.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">&apos;We are aware that some have come to you from the church of Jerusalem. These men were not sent by us, but came with false teachings that have brought confusion and division, telling you to keep the law and be circumcised&apos;things we never commanded them to teach.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">&apos;For it pleases the Holy Spirit and us</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">that we not place any unnecessary burden on you, except for the following restrictions:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">Stay away from anything sacrificed to a pagan idol, from eating what is strangled or with any blood, and from any form of sexual immorality. You will be beautiful believers</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">if you keep your souls from these things, and you will be true and faithful to our Lord Jesus. May God bless you!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">They sent the four men off for Antioch, and after gathering the regional church together, they delivered the letter.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">When the people heard the letter read out loud, they were overjoyed and delighted by its encouraging message.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">Then Judas and Silas, who were both prophets, spoke to them affirming words</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">that strengthened the believers.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">After the four men spent some time there, the church sent them off in peace to return to the apostles in Jerusalem.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">After some days, Paul said to Barnabas, &apos;Let&apos;s travel to the regions where we&apos;ve preached the word of God and see how the believers are getting along.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">Barnabas wished to take Mark (also known as John) along with them,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">but Paul disagreed. He didn&apos;t think it was proper to take the one who had deserted them in south-central Turkey,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">leaving them to do their missionary work without him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">It became a heated argument between them, a disagreement so sharp that they parted from each other. Barnabas took Mark and sailed to Cyprus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">And Paul chose Silas</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">as his partner. After the believers prayed for them, asking for the Lord&apos;s favor on their ministry, they left</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">for Syria and southeast Turkey.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">Every place they went, they left the church stronger and more encouraged than before.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="16">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Paul and Silas came to the city of Derbe and then went on to Lystra,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">the hometown of a believer named Timothy. His mother was a Jewish follower of Jesus, but his father was not a Jew.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Timothy was well known and highly respected among all the believers of Lystra and Iconium.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Paul</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">recognized God&apos;s favor on Timothy&apos;s life</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">and wanted him to accompany them in ministry, but Paul had Timothy circumcised first because of the significant Jewish community living in the region, and everyone knew that Timothy&apos;s father wasn&apos;t a Jew.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">They went out together as missionaries, traveling to different cities where they preached and informed the churches of the decrees of the apostolic council of Jerusalem for the non-Jewish converts to observe.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">All the churches were growing daily and were encouraged and strengthened in their faith.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">The Holy Spirit had forbidden Paul and his partners to preach the word in the southwestern provinces of Turkey,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">so they ministered throughout the region of central and west-central Turkey.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">When they got as far west as the borders of Mysia, they repeatedly attempted to go north into the province of Bithynia,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">but again the Spirit of Jesus would not allow them to enter.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">So instead they went right on through the province of Mysia to the seaport of Troas.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">While staying there Paul experienced a supernatural, ecstatic vision during the night. A man from Macedonia appeared before him, pleading with him, &apos;You must come across the sea to Macedonia and help us!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">After Paul had this vision, we</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">immediately prepared to cross over to Macedonia, convinced that God himself was calling us to go and preach the wonderful news of the gospel to them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">From Troas we sailed a straight course to the island of Samothrace, and the next day to Neapolis.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Finally we reached Philippi, a major city</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">in the Roman colony of Macedonia, and we remained there for a number of days.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">When the Sabbath day came, we went outside the gates of the city to the nearby river, for there appeared to be a house of prayer and worship there.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Sitting on the riverbank we struck up a conversation with some of the women who had gathered there.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">One of them was Lydia, a businesswoman from the city of Thyatira who was a dealer of exquisite purple cloth</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">and a Jewish convert. While Paul shared the good news with her, God opened her heart to receive Paul&apos;s message.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">She devoted herself to the Lord, and we baptized her and her entire family. Afterward she urged us to stay in her home, saying, &apos;Since I am now a believer in the Lord, come and stay in my house.&apos; So we were persuaded to stay there.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">One day, as we were going to the house of prayer, we encountered a young slave girl who had an evil spirit of divination, the spirit of Python.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">She had earned great profits for her owners by being a fortune-teller.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">She kept following us, shouting, &apos;These men are servants of the Great High God, and they&apos;re telling us how to be saved!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Day after day she continued to do this, until Paul, greatly annoyed, turned and said to the spirit indwelling her, &apos;I command you in the name of Jesus, the Anointed One, to come out of her, now!&apos; At that very moment, the spirit came out of her!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">When her owners realized that their potential of making profit had vanished, they forcefully seized Paul and Silas and dragged them off to the city square to face the authorities.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">When they appeared before the Roman soldiers and magistrates, the slave owners leveled accusations against them, saying, &apos;These Jews are troublemakers. They&apos;re throwing our city into confusion.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">They&apos;re pushing their Jewish religion down our throats. It&apos;s wrong and unlawful for them to promote these Jewish ways, for we are Romans living in a Roman colony.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">A great crowd gathered, and all the people joined in to come against them. The Roman officials ordered that Paul and Silas be stripped of their garments and beaten with rods on their bare backs.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">After they were severely beaten, they were thrown into prison and the jailer was commanded to guard them securely.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">So the jailer placed them in the innermost cell of the prison and had their feet bound and chained.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">Paul and Silas, undaunted, prayed in the middle of the night and sang songs of praise to God, while all the other prisoners listened to their worship.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">Suddenly, a great earthquake shook the foundations of the prison. All at once every prison door flung open and the chains of all the prisoners came loose.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">Startled, the jailer awoke and saw every cell door standing open. Assuming that all the prisoners had escaped, he drew his sword and was about to kill himself</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">when Paul shouted in the darkness, &apos;Stop! Don&apos;t hurt yourself. We&apos;re all still here.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">The jailer called for a light. When he saw that they were still in their cells, he rushed in and fell trembling at their feet.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">Then he led Paul and Silas outside and asked, &apos;What must I do to be saved?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">They answered, &apos;Believe in the Lord Jesus and you will be saved&apos;you and all your family.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">Then they prophesied the word of the Lord</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">over him and all his family.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">Even though the hour was late, he washed their wounds. Then he and all his family were baptized. He took Paul and Silas into his home and set them at his table and fed them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">The jailer and all his family were filled with joy in their newfound faith in God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">At daybreak, the magistrates sent officers to the prison with orders to tell the jailer, &apos;Let those two men go.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">The jailer informed Paul and Silas, &apos;The magistrates have sent orders to release you. So you&apos;re free to go now.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">But Paul told the officers, &apos;Look, they had us beaten in public, without a fair trial&apos;and we are Roman citizens.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">Do you think we&apos;re just going to quietly walk away after they threw us in prison and violated all of our rights? Absolutely not! You go back and tell the magistrates that they need to come down here themselves and escort us out!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">When the officers went back and reported what Paul and Silas had told them, the magistrates were frightened, especially upon hearing that they had beaten two Roman citizens without due process.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">So they went to the prison and apologized to Paul and Silas, begging them repeatedly, saying, &apos;Please leave our city.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">So Paul and Silas left the prison and went back to Lydia&apos;s house, where they met with the believers and comforted and encouraged them before departing.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="17">
			<VERS vnumber="1">After passing through the cities of Amphipolis and Apollonia, Paul and Silas arrived at Thessalonica.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">As they customarily did, they went to the synagogue to speak to the Jews from the Torah scrolls. For three weeks</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Paul challenged them by explaining the truth and proving to them the reality of the gospel&apos;that the Messiah had to suffer and die, then rise again from among the dead. He made it clear to them, saying, &apos;I come to announce to you that Jesus is the Anointed One, the Messiah!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Some of the Jews were convinced that their message was true, so they joined Paul and Silas, along with quite a few prominent women and a large number of Greeks who worshiped God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">But many of the Jews were motivated by bitter jealousy and formed a large mob out of the troublemakers, unsavory characters, and street gangs to incite a riot. They set out to attack Jason&apos;s house, for he had welcomed the apostles into his home.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">The mob was after Paul and Silas and sought to take them by force and bring them out to the people.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">When they couldn&apos;t find them, they took Jason instead, along with some of the brothers</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">in his house church</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">and dragged them before the city council. Along the way they screamed out, &apos;Those troublemakers who have turned the world upside down have come here to our city.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">And now Jason and these men have welcomed them as guests. They&apos;re traitors to Caesar, teaching that there is another king named Jesus.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Their angry shouts stirred up the crowds and troubled the city and all its officials.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">So when Paul and Silas came before the leaders of the city</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">, they refused to let them go until Jason and his men posted bail.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">That night the believers sent Paul and Silas off to the city of Berea,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">where they once again went into the synagogue.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">They found that the Jews of Berea were of more noble character and much more open minded than those of Thessalonica. They were hungry to learn and eagerly received the word. Every day they opened the scrolls of Scripture to search and examine them, to verify that what Paul taught them was true.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">A large number of Jews became believers in Jesus</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">, along with quite a few influential</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Greek women and men.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">When the news reached the Jews in Thessalonica that Paul was now in Berea, preaching the word of God, the troublemakers went there too and they agitated and stirred up the crowds against him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">The fellow believers helped Paul slip away to the coast of the Aegean Sea,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">while Silas and Timothy remained in Berea.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Those who accompanied Paul sailed with him as far as Athens. Then Paul sent them back to Berea with instructions</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">for Silas and Timothy to hurry and join him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">While Paul was waiting for them in Athens, his spirit was deeply troubled</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">when he realized that the entire city was full of idols.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">He argued the claims of the gospel</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">with the Jews in their synagogue, and with those who were worshipers of God, and every day he preached in the public square to whomever would listen.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Philosophers of the teachings of Epicurus,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">and others called Stoics,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">debated</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">with Paul. When they heard him speak about Jesus and his resurrection, they said, &apos;What strange ideas is this babbler trying to present?&apos; Others said, &apos;He&apos;s peddling some kind of foreign religion.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">So they brought him for a public dialogue before the leadership council of Athens,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">known as the Areopagus. &apos;Tell us,&apos; they said, &apos;about this new teaching that you&apos;re bringing to our city.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">You&apos;re presenting strange and astonishing things to our ears, and we want to know what it all means.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Now, it was the favorite pastime of the Athenians and visitors to Athens to discuss the newest ideas and philosophies.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">So Paul stood in the middle of the leadership council and said, &apos;Respected leaders of Athens,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">it is clear to me how extravagant you are in your worship of idols.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">For as I walked through your city, I was captivated by the many shrines and objects of your worship. I even found an inscription on one altar that read, &apos;To the Unknown God.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">I have come to introduce to you this God whom you worship without even knowing anything about him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">&apos;The true God is the Creator of all things. He is the owner and Lord of the heavenly realm and the earthly realm, and he doesn&apos;t live in man-made temples.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">He supplies life and breath and all things to every living being. He doesn&apos;t lack a thing that we mortals could supply for him, for he has all things and everything he needs.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">From one man, Adam, he made every man and woman and every race of humanity, and he spread us over all the earth. He sets the boundaries of people and nations, determining their appointed times in history.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">He has done this so that every person would long for God, feel their way to him,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">and find him&apos;for he is the God who is easy to discover!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">It is through him that we live and function and have our identity; just as your own poets have said,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">&apos;Our lineage comes from him.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">&apos;Since our lineage can be traced back to God, how could we even think that the divine image could be compared to something made of gold, silver, or stone, sculpted by man&apos;s artwork and clever imagination?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">&apos;In the past God tolerated</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">our ignorance of these things, but now the time of deception has passed away.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">He commands us all to repent and turn to God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">For the appointed day has risen, in which he is going to judge the world in righteousness by the man he has designated. And the proof given to the world that God has chosen this man is this: he resurrected him from among the dead!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">The moment they heard Paul bring up the topic of resurrection, some of them ridiculed him,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">then got up and left</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">. But others said, &apos;We want to hear you again later about these things.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">So Paul left the meeting.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">But there were some who believed the message and joined him from that day forward. Among them were Dionysius, a judge on the leadership council,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">and a woman named Damaris.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="18">
			<VERS vnumber="1">When Paul left Athens he traveled to Corinth,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">where he met a Jewish man named Aquila, who was originally from northeastern Turkey.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">He and his wife, Priscilla, had recently emigrated from Italy to Corinth because Emperor Claudius had expelled all the Jews from Rome.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Since Paul and Aquila were both tentmakers</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">by trade, Paul moved in with them and they became business partners.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Every Sabbath day Paul spoke openly in the synagogue, to both Jews and non-Jews,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">attempting to persuade them</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">to believe the message of Jesus</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">When Silas and Timothy finally arrived from Macedonia, Paul spent all his time preaching the word of God,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">trying to convince the Jews that Jesus was the Messiah.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">When they viciously slandered him and hurled abuse on him, he symbolically shook the dust off his clothes in protest against them. He said to them, &apos;Have it your way then! I am guiltless as to your fate, for the blood-guilt of your actions will be on your own heads, and from now on I will preach to the non-Jews.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Leaving the synagogue, Paul went to the home of Titus,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">a convert to Judaism, for he and his family attended the Jewish meetings</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">and they had all become believers in Jesus</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Crispus,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">the leader of the synagogue, believed in the Lord, together with his entire family, and many of the Corinthians who heard what had happened believed in the Lord and were baptized.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">One night, the Lord spoke to Paul in a supernatural vision and said, &apos;Don&apos;t ever be afraid. Speak</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">the words that I give you</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">and don&apos;t be intimidated,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">because I am with you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">No one will be able to hurt you, for there are many in this city whom I call my own.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">For the next year and a half, Paul stayed in Corinth, faithfully teaching the word of God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Now, at that time, Gallio was the regional governor who ruled over the Roman province of Achaia,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">and the Jews turned against Paul and came together to seize him and bring him publicly before the governor&apos;s court.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">They accused him before Gallio, saying, &apos;This man is creating a disturbance by persuading people to worship God in ways that are contrary to our laws.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Just as Paul was about to speak in his defense, Gallio interrupted and said, &apos;Wait! If this involved some major crime or fraud, it would be my responsibility to hear the case.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">But this is nothing more than a disagreement among yourselves over semantics</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">and personalities</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">and traditions of your own Jewish laws.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Go and settle it yourselves! I refuse to be the judge of these issues.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">So Gallio dismissed them from the court.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Immediately the crowd turned on Sosthenes,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">one of the leaders</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">of the synagogue</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">who sided with Paul</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">. They seized him and beat him up right there in the courtroom! But Gallio showed no concern at all over what was happening.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">After remaining in Corinth several more days, Paul finally bid</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">shalom</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">to the believers and sailed away for the coast of Syria, accompanied by Priscilla and Aquila.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Before they left, Paul had his head shaved at Cenchrea,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">because he had taken a vow of dedication.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">When they reached Ephesus,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Paul left Priscilla and Aquila behind, then he went into the synagogue and spoke to the Jews.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">They asked him to stay longer, but he refused</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">and said farewell to them, adding, &apos;I will come back to you, if it is God&apos;s will, after I go to Jerusalem to observe the feast.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Then he set sail from Ephesus for Caesarea.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">When he arrived there he traveled on to Jerusalem to visit the church and pray for them,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">then he left for Antioch.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">After spending some time there, Paul continued on through the region of Galatia and Phyrgia in central Turkey. And wherever he went he encouraged and strengthened the believers.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">A Jewish man by the name of Apollos arrived in Ephesus. He was a native of Alexandria</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">and was recognized as an educated and cultured man. He was powerful in the Scriptures,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">had accepted Jesus, and had been taught about the Lord. He was spiritually passionate</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">for Jesus and a convincing teacher, although he only knew about the baptism of John.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">He fearlessly preached</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">in the synagogue. But when Priscilla and Aquila heard Apollos&apos; teachings, they met with him privately</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">and revealed to him the ways of God more completely.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">Then Apollos, with the encouragement of the believers, went to the province of Achaia.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">He took a letter of recommendation from the brothers of Ephesus so his ministry would be welcomed in the region. He was a tremendous help to the believers and caused them to increase in grace.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">Apollos boldly and publicly confronted the Jews, vigorously debating them, proving undeniably from the Scriptures that Jesus was the Messiah.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="19">
			<VERS vnumber="1">While Apollos was ministering in Corinth, Paul traveled on through the regions</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">of Turkey</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">until he arrived in Ephesus, where he found</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">a group of twelve</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">followers of Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">The first thing he asked them was &apos;Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you became believers?&apos; &apos;No,&apos; they replied. &apos;We&apos;ve not even heard of a holy spirit.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Paul asked, &apos;Then what was the meaning of your baptism?&apos; They responded, &apos;It meant that we would follow John&apos;s teaching.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Paul said, &apos;John&apos;s baptism was for those who were turning from their sins,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">and he taught you to believe in and follow the one who was coming after him: Jesus the Anointed One.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">When they understood this, they were baptized into the authority of Jesus, the Anointed One.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">For three months Paul taught openly and fearlessly in the synagogue, arguing persuasively for them to enter into God&apos;s kingdom realm.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">But some of them hardened their hearts and stubbornly refused to believe. When they spoke evil</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">of the Way in front of the congregation, Paul withdrew from them and took the believers with him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Every day</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">for over two years,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">he taught them in the lecture hall of Tyrannus,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">which resulted in everyone living in the province of Asia,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Jews and non-Jews, hearing the prophetic word of the Lord.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">God kept releasing a flow of extraordinary miracles through the hands of Paul.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Because of this, people took Paul&apos;s handkerchiefs and articles of clothing, even pieces of cloth that had touched his skin, laying them on the bodies of the sick, and diseases and demons left them and they were healed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">One day, when they said those words, the demon in the man replied, &apos;I know about Jesus, and I recognize Paul, but who do you think you are?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Then the demonized man jumped on them and threw them to the ground, beating them mercilessly.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">He overpowered the seven exorcists until they all ran out of the house naked and badly bruised.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">All of the people in Ephesus were awestruck, both Jews and non-Jews, when they heard about what had happened. Great fear fell over the entire city, and the authority of the name of Jesus was exalted.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Many believers publicly confessed their sins and disclosed their secrets.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Large numbers of those who had been practicing magic took all of their</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">books and scrolls of spells and incantations</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">and publicly burned them. When the value of all the books and scrolls was calculated, it all came to several million dollars.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">The power of God caused the word to spread, and the people were greatly impacted.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Paul had it in his heart to go to Jerusalem and, on his way there, to revisit the places in Greece where he had ministered.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">&apos;After that,&apos; he said, &apos;I have to go to Rome also.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">So he sent ahead into Macedonia two of his ministry assistants, Timothy</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">and Erastus,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">while he remained in western Turkey.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">At that time a major disturbance erupted in Ephesus over the people following God&apos;s way.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">It began with a wealthy man named Demetrius, who had built a large business and enriched many craftsmen by manufacturing silver shrines for the Greek goddess Artemis.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">Our businesses are in danger of being discredited. And not only that, but the temple of our great goddess Artemis is being dishonored and seen as worthless.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">She is the goddess of all of western Turkey and is worshiped in all the world. But if this outrage continues, everyone everywhere will suffer the loss of her magnificent greatness.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">When the people heard this, they were filled with boiling rage. They shouted over and over, &apos;Artemis, the great goddess of the Ephesians!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">The entire city was thrown into chaos as everyone rushed into the stadium together,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">dragging with them Gaius</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">and Aristarchus,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">Paul&apos;s traveling companions from Macedonia.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">When Paul attempted to go in and speak to the massive crowd, the disciples wouldn&apos;t let him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">Some of the high-ranking governmental officials of the region, because they loved him,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">sent Paul an urgent message, saying, &apos;Whatever you do, don&apos;t step foot into that stadium!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">The frenzied crowd shouted out one thing, and others shouted something else, until they were all in mass confusion, with many not even knowing why they were there!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">Some of the Jews pushed forward a Jewish man named Alexander to be their spokesman, and different factions of the crowd shouted instructions at him. He stood before the people and motioned for everyone to be quiet so he could be heard.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">But when he began to speak, they realized that he was a Jew, so they shouted him down. For nearly two hours they shouted over and over, &apos;Great is Artemis, the goddess of the Ephesians!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">Eventually the mayor of the city</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">was able to quiet them down. He said, &apos;Fellow citizens! Who in the world doesn&apos;t know that we are devoted to the great temple</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">of Artemis and to her image that fell from Zeus out of heaven?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">Since no one can deny it, you should all just be quiet. Calm down and don&apos;t do anything hasty.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">For you have brought these men before us who aren&apos;t guilty of any crime. They are neither temple robbers nor blasphemers of our goddess.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">So if Demetrius and the men of his trade have a case against someone, the courts are open. They can appear before the judge and press charges.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">But if you&apos;re looking for anything further to bring up, it must be argued before the court and settled there, not here.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">Don&apos;t you realize we&apos;re putting our city in danger of being accused of a riot by the Roman authorities? There&apos;s no good explanation we can give them for all this commotion!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">After he had said this, he dispersed the crowds and sent them away.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="20">
			<VERS vnumber="1">When the uproar finally died down, Paul gathered the believers and encouraged their hearts. He kissed them,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">said good-bye, and left for Macedonia.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">At every place he passed through, he brought words of great comfort and encouragement to the believers. Then he went on to Greece</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">and stayed there for three months. Just as Paul was about to sail for Syria, he learned of a plot against him by the Jews, so he decided to return by going through Macedonia.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Seven men accompanied him as far as western Turkey. They were Sopater,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">son of Pyrrhus</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">from Berea, Aristarchus</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">and Secundus</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">from Thessalonica, Gaius</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">from Derbe, and Timothy,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Tychicus,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">and Trophimus</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">from western Turkey.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">These men went ahead and were waiting for us at Troas.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">As soon as all of the Passover celebrations were over,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">we sailed from Philippi. After five days we joined the others in Troas, where we stayed another week.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">On Sunday we gathered to take communion</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">and to hear Paul preach. Because he was planning to leave the next day, he continued speaking until past midnight.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">There were many flickering lights</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">in the upstairs chamber where we were meeting.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Sitting in an open window listening was a young man named Eutychus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">As Paul&apos;s sermon dragged on, Eutychus became drowsy and fell into a deep slumber. Sound asleep, he fell three stories to his death below.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Paul went downstairs, bent over the boy, and embraced him. Taking him in his arms, he said to all the people gathered, &apos;Stop your worrying. He&apos;s come back to life!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Paul went back upstairs, served communion, and ate a meal with them. Then he picked back up where he left off and taught until dawn.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Filled with enormous joy, they took the boy home alive and everyone was encouraged.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Continuing our journey, we made our way to the ship and sailed for Assos.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Paul had previously arranged to meet us there as he traveled overland by foot.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">So he rejoined our team there and we took him aboard and sailed for Mitylene.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">The next day we crossed over to Chios,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">and the following day we arrived at the island of Samos.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">We stayed at Trogyllium,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">and on the day after that we reached Miletus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Paul was in a hurry to arrive in Jerusalem, hoping to make it in time for the Feast of Pentecost, so he decided to bypass Ephesus and not spend any time in that region.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">However, from Miletus Paul had sent a message to the elders of the church</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">in Ephesus and asked them to come meet with him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">When they arrived, he said to them, &apos;All of you know how I&apos;ve lived and conducted myself while I was with you. From the first day I set foot in western Turkey</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">I&apos;ve operated in God&apos;s miracle power</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">with great humility and served you</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">with many tears. I&apos;ve endured numerous ordeals because of the plots of the Jews.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">You know how I&apos;ve taught you in public meetings and in your homes, and that I&apos;ve not held anything back from you that would help you grow.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">I urged both Jews and non-Jews to turn from sin to God and to have faith in our Lord Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">And now I am captive to the Holy Spirit</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">to go to Jerusalem, without really knowing what will happen to me there.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">Yet I know that the Holy Spirit warns me</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">in town after town, saying, &apos;Chains and afflictions are prepared for you.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">&apos;But whether I live or die is not important, for I don&apos;t esteem my life as indispensable.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">It&apos;s more important for me to fulfill my destiny and to finish the ministry my Lord Jesus has assigned to me, which is to faithfully preach the wonderful news of God&apos;s grace.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">I&apos;ve been a part of your lives and shared with you many times the message of God&apos;s kingdom realm. But now I leave you, and you will not see my face again.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">If any of you should be lost, I will not be blamed, for my conscience is clean,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">because I&apos;ve taught you everything I could about God&apos;s eternal plan and I&apos;ve held nothing back.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">So guard your hearts. Be true shepherds</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">over all the flock and feed them well. Remember, it was the Holy Spirit who appointed you to guard and oversee</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">the churches that belong to Jesus, the Anointed One,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">which he purchased and established by his own blood.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">&apos;I know that after I leave, imposters who have no loyalty to the flock</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">will come among you like savage wolves.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">Even some from among your very own ranks will rise up, twisting the truth</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">to seduce people into following them instead of Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">So be alert and discerning. Remember that for three years, night and day, I&apos;ve never stopped warning each of you, pouring out my heart to you with tears.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">&apos;And so now, I entrust you into God&apos;s hands and the message of his grace,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">which is all that you need to become strong.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">All of God&apos;s blessings are imparted through the message of his grace, which he provides as the spiritual inheritance given to all of his holy ones.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">&apos;I haven&apos;t been after your money or any of your possessions.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">You all know that I&apos;ve worked with my hands to meet my own needs and the needs of those who&apos;ve served with me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">I&apos;ve left you an example of how you should serve and take care of those who are weak.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">For we must always cherish the words of our Lord Jesus, who taught,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">&apos;Giving brings a far greater blessing than receiving.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">After Paul finished speaking, he knelt down and prayed with them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">Then they all cried with great weeping as one after another hugged Paul and kissed him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">What broke their hearts the most were his words &apos;You will not see my face again.&apos; Then they tearfully accompanied Paul back to the ship.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="21">
			<VERS vnumber="1">After we tore ourselves away from them, we put out to sea and sailed a direct course for the island of Kos, and on the next day to the island of Rhodes,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">and from there to Patara.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">There we found a ship that was crossing over to Syria,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">so we went aboard and sailed away.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">After we sighted Cyprus and sailed south of it, we docked at Tyre</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">in Syria, where the ship unloaded its cargo.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">When we went ashore we found a number of believers and stayed with them for a week.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">They prophesied to Paul repeatedly</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">, warning him by the Holy Spirit not to set foot in Jerusalem.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">When it was time for us to leave and be on our way, everyone&apos;men, women, and children&apos;accompanied us out of the city down to the beach. After we all knelt</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">in the sand</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">and prayed together,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">we kissed one another,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">said our good-byes, and boarded the ship, while the believers went back to their homes.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">From Tyre we sailed</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">on to the town of Akko and greeted the believers there with peace.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">We stayed with them for a day.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Then we went on to Caesarea and stayed for several days</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">in the home of Philip the evangelist, who was one of the seven deacons</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">and</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">the father of four unmarried daughters who prophesied.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">During our stay of several days, Agabus,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">a prophet from Judea, came to visit us.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">As a prophetic gesture</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">, he took Paul&apos;s belt and tied his own hands and feet with it as he prophesied, &apos;The Holy Spirit says, &apos;The one who owns this belt will be tied up in this same way by the Jews and they will hand him over to those who are not Jews.&apos; &apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">When we heard this, both we and the believers of Caesarea begged Paul not to go on to Jerusalem.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">But Paul replied, &apos;Why do you cry and break my heart with your tears? Don&apos;t you know that I&apos;m prepared not only to be imprisoned but to die in Jerusalem for the sake of the wonder of the name of our Lord Jesus?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Because we couldn&apos;t persuade him, we gave up and said nothing more except &apos;May the will of the Lord be done.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Afterward we packed our bags and set off for Jerusalem,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">with some of the believers from Caesarea accompanying us.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">They brought us to a village</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">where they introduced us to Mnason, a Cypriot, one of the original disciples,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">and he offered us hospitality.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">When we finally arrived in Jerusalem, the believers welcomed us with delight.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">The next day Paul and our team had a meeting with Jacob</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">and all the elders of the Jerusalem church.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">After greeting everyone, Paul explained in detail what God had accomplished through his ministry among the non-Jewish people.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">When they heard Paul&apos;s report, they praised God. And they said to him, &apos;You should know, brother, that there are many tens of thousands of Jews who have also embraced the faith and are passionately keeping the law of Moses.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">But they&apos;ve heard a rumor that you&apos;ve been instructing the Jews everywhere to abandon Moses</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">by telling them they don&apos;t need to circumcise their children or keep our Jewish customs.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">They will certainly hear that you&apos;ve come to Jerusalem. So what is the proper way to proceed?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">We urge you to follow our suggestion. We have four men here who have taken a vow and are ready to have their heads shaved.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">Now go with them to the temple and sponsor them in their purification ceremony,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">and pay all their required expenses. Then everyone will know that the rumors they&apos;ve heard are false. They&apos;ll see that you are one who lives according to the law of Moses.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">But in reference to the non-Jewish believers, we&apos;ve sent them a letter with our decision, stating that they should avoid eating meat that has been offered to an idol, or eating blood or any animal that has been strangled, and to avoid sexual immorality.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">The next day, Paul took the four men to the temple and ceremonially purified himself along with them. He publicly gave notice of the date when their vows would end and when sacrifices would be offered for each of them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">When the seven-day period</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">was almost over, a number of Jews from western Turkey</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">who had seen him in the temple courts stirred up the whole crowd against him. Seizing him,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">they shouted, &apos;Men of Israel, help us! This is the man who teaches everywhere what is contrary to our nation, our law, and this temple. And not only that, but now he brings these non-Jewish men with him into the inner courts of our temple! They have made this sacred place ritually unclean.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">(For Trophimus, an Ephesian, had been seen previously with him, and they assumed that he entered the inner courts with Paul.)</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">This ignited a huge riot in the city as all the people came together to seize Paul and drag him out of the temple courts, closing the gates behind him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">But as they were about to kill Paul, the news reached the commander of the Roman garrison</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">that the entire city was in an uproar.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">He immediately ran out to the crowd with a large number of his officers and soldiers. When the crowd saw them coming, they stopped beating Paul.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">The commander arrested him and ordered that he be bound with two chains. He then asked, &apos;Who is he and what has he done wrong?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">Some in the crowd shouted one thing and others something else, just adding to the confusion. Since the commander was unable to get to the truth because of the disturbance, he ordered that Paul be brought back to their headquarters.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">When they reached the steps leading up to the fortress,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">they had to protect Paul and carry him up because of the violent mob following them,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">and everyone was screaming out, &apos;Away with this man! Kill him!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">As Paul was being led to the entrance of the compound, he said to the commander in Greek, &apos;May I have a word with you?&apos; The commander replied, &apos;So you know Greek, do you?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">Aren&apos;t you that Egyptian fanatic who started a rebellion some time ago and led four thousand assassins</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">out into the wilderness?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">Paul answered, &apos;I am, in fact, a Jew from Tarsus, in Cilicia, a well-known city of southern Turkey where I was born. I beg you, sir, please give me a moment to speak to these people.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">When the commander gave his permission, Paul stood on the steps and gestured with his hands for the people to listen. When the crowd quieted down, Paul addressed them in Aramaic</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">and said:</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="22">
			<VERS vnumber="1">&apos;Ladies and gentlemen, fellow believers and elders</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">&apos;please listen to me as I offer my defense.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">(Now, when everyone realized he was speaking to them in their Judean Aramaic language,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">the crowd became all the more attentive.)</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Then Paul said, &apos;I am a Jewish man who was born in Tarsus, a city of Turkey.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">However, I grew up in this city and was properly trained in the Mosaic law and tutored by Rabbi Gamaliel according to our ancestral customs. I&apos;ve been extremely passionate in my desire to please God, just as all of you are today.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">I&apos;ve hunted down and killed the followers of this Way. I have seized them and thrown them into prison, both men and women.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">All of this can be verified by the high priest and the Supreme Council of Elders. For they even wrote letters to our fellow Jews of Damascus, authorizing me to arrest them and bring them back to Jerusalem as prisoners to be punished.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">&apos;As I was on the road approaching Damascus, about noon, a brilliant heavenly light suddenly appeared, flashing all around me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">As I fell to the ground I heard a voice say,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">&apos;Saul, Saul . . . why are you persecuting me?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">&apos;I answered, &apos;Who are you, my Lord?&apos; &apos;He said to me, &apos;I am Jesus, the Victorious. I am the one you are persecuting.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">&apos;Those who were with me saw the brilliant light, but they didn&apos;t hear the voice of the one who spoke to me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">&apos;So I asked, &apos;Lord, what am I to do?&apos; &apos;And the Lord said to me, &apos;Get up and go into Damascus, and there you will be told about all that you are destined to do.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">&apos;Because of the dazzling glory of the light, I couldn&apos;t see&apos;I was left blind. So they had to lead me by the hand the rest of the way into Damascus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">&apos;A Jewish man living there named Ananias came to see me. He was a godly man who lived according to the law of Moses and was highly esteemed by the Jewish community.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">He stood beside me and said, &apos;Saul! My brother, Saul&apos;open your eyes and see again!&apos; At that very instant I opened my eyes and I could see!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Then he said to me, &apos;The God of our ancestors has destined you</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">to know his plan and for you to see the Holy One</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">and to hear his voice.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">For you will be his witness</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">to every race of people and will share with them everything that you&apos;ve seen and heard.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">So now, what are you waiting for? Get up, be baptized, and wash away your sins as you call upon his name.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">&apos;Then I returned to Jerusalem. And while I was praying in the temple, I entered another realm</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">and saw him. He said to me,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">&apos;Hurry and depart from Jerusalem quickly, for the people here will not receive the truths you share about me.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">&apos; &apos;But Lord,&apos; I argued, &apos;they all know that I&apos;m the one who went into our Jewish meetings to find those who believe in you and had them beaten</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">and imprisoned.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">When the blood of your witness</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Stephen was shed, I stood nearby in full approval of what was happening. I even guarded the cloaks of those who</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">stoned him to death</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">&apos;Then he said to me,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">&apos;Go at once, for I am sending you to preach to the non-Jewish nations.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">The crowd listened attentively to Paul up to this point. But when they heard this, all at once they erupted with loud shouts, saying, &apos;Get rid of this man! Kill him! He doesn&apos;t deserve to live!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">While the crowd was screaming and yelling, removing their outer garments, and throwing handfuls of dust in the air in protest,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">the commander had Paul brought back into the compound. He ordered that he be whipped with a lash and interrogated to find out what he said that so infuriated the crowd.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">When the soldiers stretched Paul out with ropes, he said to the captain, who was standing nearby, &apos;Is it legal for you to torture a Roman citizen like this, without a proper trial?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">When the officer heard this, he immediately went to his commander and reported it, saying, &apos;This man is a Roman citizen. What should we do now?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">The commander came to Paul and asked him, &apos;Tell me the truth, are you a Roman citizen?&apos; &apos;Yes I am,&apos; he replied.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">The commander said, &apos;I had to purchase my citizenship with a great sum of money.&apos; Paul replied, &apos;I was born as a citizen!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">All of the soldiers who were about to whip Paul backed away, because they were afraid of the consequences for tying up and holding a Roman citizen against his will.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">The next day the commander ordered that the high priest and the supreme Jewish council</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">be convened, because he wanted to find out exactly why the Jews were accusing Paul. So he had him untied and brought out to stand before them all.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="23">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Paul fixed his eyes on the members of the council and said, &apos;My brothers, up to this day I have lived my life before God with a perfectly clear conscience.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">At that moment, Ananias</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">the high priest ordered those standing near Paul to strike him in the mouth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Paul responded, &apos;God is going to strike you, you corrupt pretender!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">For you sit there judging me according to the law, yet you broke the law when you ordered me to be struck.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Those standing near Paul said to him, &apos;Do you dare insult the high priest of God?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Paul answered, &apos;I had no idea, brothers, that he was the high priest.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">For the Scriptures say, &apos;Do not curse the ruler of your people.&apos; &apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Just then Paul realized that part of the council were Sadducees, who deny the resurrection of the dead,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">and others were of the separated ones. So he shouted, &apos;My fellow Jews, I am a separated one,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">and the son of a separated one. That&apos;s why I&apos;m on trial here. It&apos;s because of the hope I have that the dead will rise to live again.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">When he said this, a heated argument started among them, dividing the council between the Sadducees and the separated ones.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Paul knew</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">that the Sadducees teach there is no resurrection and do not believe in angels or spirits, but the separated ones believe in them all.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">This sparked an even greater uproar among them. Finally, some of the separated ones who were religious scholars stood up and protested strongly, saying, &apos;We find nothing wrong with this man. It could be that the Spirit has spoken to him or an angel came to him.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">When the shouting match became intense, the commander, fearing they would tear Paul to pieces, intervened and ordered his soldiers to go in to their meeting and seize him and take him back to their headquarters.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">That night our Lord appeared to Paul and stood before him and said,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">&apos;Receive miracle power.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">For just as you have spoken for me in Jerusalem, you will also speak for me in Rome.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">They went to the high priest and the elders to divulge their plans and said to them, &apos;We have united in a solemn oath not to eat or drink until Paul is dead.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">So we urge you to have the commander bring him to you as though you were to determine his case with a more thorough inquiry. And we will kill him before he even gets here!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">When Paul&apos;s nephew, his sister&apos;s son, overheard their plot to kill him, he came to the headquarters and informed him of their plans.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Paul called for one of the captains</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">and said, &apos;Take this boy</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">to the commander, for he has something important to report to him.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">The captain took him to the commander and informed him, &apos;Paul the prisoner asked me to bring this boy to you because he has something important for you to know.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">The commander took him by the arm and led him aside in private and asked him, &apos;What do you have to tell me?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">He replied, &apos;The Jews have plotted to kill Paul. Tomorrow they will ask you to bring him again to the supreme council under the pretense of wanting to question him further.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Don&apos;t believe them, because they have forty men lying in wait to ambush Paul. These men have sworn an oath not to eat or drink until they have killed him. They&apos;re all waiting for you to agree to their request</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">so they can carry out their plot</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">The commander dismissed Paul&apos;s nephew after directing him, &apos;Tell no one that you&apos;ve reported these things to me.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">He sent with them a letter that read:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">From Claudias Lysias, to His Excellency, Governor Felix: Dear Governor,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">I rescued this man, who was seized by the Jews as they were about to put him to death. I intervened with my troops because I understand that he is a Roman citizen.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">I was determined to learn exactly what charge they were accusing him of, so I brought him to stand before the Jewish supreme council.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">I discovered that he was being accused with reference to violating controversial issues about their law, but I found no charge against him that deserved death or imprisonment.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">When I was informed of an imminent plot to kill him, I sent him to you at once, and I have ordered his accusers to also come before you and state their charges against him. Sincerely, Claudius Lysias</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">The soldiers carried out their orders and escorted Paul during the night until they reached the city of Antipatris.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">The next day the horsemen continued on with Paul and the rest of the soldiers were dismissed to return to their headquarters.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">Upon their arrival in Caesarea, they presented the letter to the governor and brought Paul before him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">After reading the letter, he asked Paul what province he was from. Paul answered, &apos;Southeast Turkey.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">The governor said, &apos;I will give you a full hearing when your accusers arrive here also.&apos; Then he ordered that Paul be kept under guard in Herod&apos;s palace.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="24">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Five days later, Ananias the high priest arrived in Caesarea, accompanied by some Jewish elders and Tertullus, their prosecuting attorney.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">They were brought before the governor to present formal charges against Paul.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">After Paul was summoned, Tertullus accused him, saying,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">&apos;Your Excellency Felix, under the shadow of your wise leadership</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">we Jews have experienced a long period of peace. Because of your wise foresight, many reforms are coming to pass in our nation because of you, Most Honorable Felix. We deeply appreciate this and thank you very much.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">&apos;So that I won&apos;t weary you with a lengthy presentation, I beg you to hear our brief summary, with your customary graciousness.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">For we have found this man to be a contagious plague,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">a seditious man who continually stirs up riots among the Jews all over the world. He has become a ringleader of the sect known as the Nazarenes.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">He has even attempted to desecrate our temple, which is why we had him arrested. We sought to judge him according to our law,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">but Commander Lysias came with great force, snatched him away from our hands, and sent him here to you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">He has ordered his accusers to come to you so that you could interrogate him and ascertain for yourself that all these charges we are bringing against him are true.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">All the Jews present joined in the verbal attack, saying, &apos;Yes, it&apos;s true!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">The governor motioned that it was Paul&apos;s turn to speak, so he began to answer the accusations. &apos;Because I know that you have been a judge over this nation for many years, I gladly respond in my defense.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">You can easily verify that about twelve days ago, I went to Jerusalem to worship.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">No one found me arguing with anyone or causing trouble among the people in the synagogues or in the temple or anywhere in the city.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">They are completely unable to prove these accusations they make against me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">&apos;But I do confess this to you: I worship the God of our Jewish ancestors as a follower of the Way, which they call a sect. For I believe everything that is written in the Law and the Prophets.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">And my hope is in God, the same hope that even my accusers have embraced, the hope of a resurrection from the dead of both the righteous and the unrighteous.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">That&apos;s why I seek with all my heart to have a clean conscience toward God and toward others.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">&apos;After being away from Jerusalem for several years, I returned to bring to my people gifts for the poor.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">I was in the temple, ritually purified and presenting my offering to God, when they seized me. I had no noisy crowd around me, and I wasn&apos;t causing trouble or making any kind of disturbance whatsoever.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">It was a group of Jews from western Turkey</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">who were being unruly; they are the ones who should be here now to bring their charges if they have anything against me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Or at least these men standing before you should clearly state what crime they found me guilty of when I stood before the Jewish supreme council,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">unless it&apos;s the one thing I passionately spoke out when I stood among them. I am on trial today only because of my belief in the resurrection of the dead.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Felix, who was well acquainted with the facts about the Way, concluded the hearing with these words: &apos;I will decide your case after Commander Lysias arrives.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">He then ordered the captain to keep Paul in protective custody, but to give him a measure of freedom, he allowed any of his friends to visit him and help take care of his needs.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">Several days later, Felix came back with his wife, Drusilla,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">who was Jewish. They sent for Paul and listened as he shared with them about faith in Jesus, the Anointed One.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">As Paul spoke about true righteousness, self-control, and the coming judgment, Felix became terrified and said, &apos;Leave me for now. I&apos;ll send for you later when it&apos;s more convenient.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">He expected to receive a bribe from Paul for his release, so for that reason he would send for Paul from time to time to converse with him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">Two years later, Felix was succeeded by Porcius Festus. Before he left office he decided to leave Paul in prison as a political favor to the Jews.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="25">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Three days after Festus assumed his duties in Caesarea, he made the journey to Jerusalem.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Religious authorities and prominent leaders among the Jews brought formal charges against Paul before Festus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">They came asking him for a favor&apos;that he would transfer Paul from Caesarea to Jerusalem&apos;all the while plotting to ambush and kill Paul along the way.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Festus responded to their request by informing them that he planned to return to Caesarea shortly.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">He told them, &apos;Your leaders can come with me to Caesarea. If this man has broken any laws, you can bring charges against him there.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">After Festus had stayed in Jerusalem no more than eight to ten days, he left for Caesarea. The day after he arrived, he convened the court and took his seat on the bench as judge over the proceedings. After he ordered Paul brought into the courtroom,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">the Jewish leaders who came from Jerusalem encircled him and leveled against him many serious charges, which they were unable to substantiate.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">In his defense, Paul said by the Holy Spirit,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">&apos;I have done nothing wrong.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">I&apos;ve committed no offense against Jewish law, or against the temple, or against Caesar.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Festus, because he wanted to curry favor with the Jews, asked Paul, &apos;Are you willing to go with me to Jerusalem and be tried for these charges?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Paul replied, &apos;I am standing here before Caesar&apos;s tribunal. This is where I should be tried. As you well know, I have done no harm to the Jews.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">If I have committed a crime worthy of death, I won&apos;t seek to escape the death penalty. But if none of their charges are true, no one has the right to hand me over to them. I appeal to Caesar!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">After conferring with the members of his council, Festus replied, &apos;Since you have appealed to Caesar, to Caesar you will go!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Several days later, King Agrippa and Bernice</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">arrived at Caesarea for a visit with Festus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">During their stay of many days, Festus explained Paul&apos;s situation to the king to get his opinion on the matter, saying, &apos;There is a man here whom Felix left as a prisoner.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">When I was in Jerusalem, the leading priests and Jewish elders pressed charges against him and demanded that I issue a guilty verdict against him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">I explained to them that it is not our Roman custom to condemn any man before he has an opportunity to face his accusers and present his defense.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">So they returned here with me. I didn&apos;t postpone the trial, but convened the court the very next day and ordered the man to be brought before me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">I listened to their accusations against him, but they were not what I expected to hear, for he had committed no crime.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Rather, their issues centered around disagreements with him over their religion, and about a dead man named Jesus, who Paul claimed was alive.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Because I was perplexed about how to proceed, I asked him if he would be willing to go to Jerusalem to stand trial on these charges.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">When Paul appealed his case to the emperor for a decision, I ordered him to be held in custody until I could send him to Caesar.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">King Agrippa said to Festus, &apos;I would like to listen to this man myself.&apos; &apos;Tomorrow,&apos; he replied, &apos;you will have that opportunity.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">The next day King Agrippa and Bernice entered the audience hall with much pomp and pageantry. Accompanying them were the senior military officers and prominent citizens. Festus ordered that Paul be brought before them all.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">Then Festus said, &apos;King Agrippa, and esteemed guests, here is the man whom the entire Jewish community, both here and in Jerusalem, has asked me to condemn to death. They have screamed and shouted at me, demanding that I end his life.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">Yet upon investigation I couldn&apos;t find one thing that he has done to deserve the death penalty. When he appealed to His Majesty the emperor, I determined to send him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">But I have nothing concrete to write to His Majesty, so I have now brought him before you all, and especially before you, King Agrippa. After this preliminary hearing I should have something to write,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">for it seems absurd to me to send a prisoner without specifying the charges against him.&apos;</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="26">
			<VERS vnumber="1">King Agrippa said to Paul, &apos;You may now state your case.&apos; Paul motioned with his hand for silence, then began his defense.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">&apos;King Agrippa, I consider myself highly favored to stand before you today and answer the charges made against me by the Jews.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Because you, more than anyone else, are very familiar with the customs and controversies among the Jewish people, I now ask for your patience as I state my case.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">&apos;All the Jews know how I have been raised as a young man, living among my own people from the beginning and in Jerusalem.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">If my accusers are willing to testify, they must admit that they&apos;ve known me all along as a Pharisee, a member of the most strict and orthodox sect within Judaism.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">And now, here I am on trial because I believe in the hope</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">of God&apos;s promises made to our ancestors.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">This is the promise the twelve tribes of our people hope to see fulfilled as they sincerely strive to serve God with prayers night and day. &apos;So, Your Highness, it is because of this hope that the Jews are accusing me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">And how should you judge this matter?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Why is it that any of you think it unbelievable that God raises the dead?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">I used to think that I should do all that was in my power to oppose the name of Jesus of Nazareth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">And that&apos;s exactly what I did in Jerusalem, for I not only imprisoned many of the holy believers by the authority of the chief priests, I also cast my vote against them, sentencing them to death.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">I punished them often in every Jewish meeting hall and attempted to force them to blaspheme. I boiled with rage against them, hunting them down in distant foreign cities to persecute them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">&apos;For that purpose I went to Damascus, with the authority granted to me by the chief priests.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">While traveling on the road at noon, Your Highness, I saw a light brighter than the sun flashing from heaven all around me and those who were with me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">We all fell to the ground, and I heard a voice speaking to me in Aramaic, saying,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">&apos;Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me? You are only hurting yourself when you resist your calling.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">&apos;I asked, &apos;Who are you, Lord?&apos; &apos;And the Lord replied, &apos;I am Jesus, the one you are persecuting.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Get up and stand to your feet, for I have appeared to you</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">to reveal your destiny and to commission you</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">as my assistant.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">You will be a witness to what you have seen and to the things I will reveal whenever I appear to you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">I will rescue you from the persecution of your own people and from the hostility of the other nations that I will send you to.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">And you will open their eyes to their true condition, so that they may turn from darkness to the Light</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">and from the power</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">of Satan to the power of God. By placing their faith in me they will receive the total forgiveness</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">of sins and be made holy,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">taking hold of the inheritance that I give to my children</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">&apos;So you see, King Agrippa, I have not been disobedient to what was revealed to me from heaven.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">For it was in Damascus that I first declared the truth. And then I went to Jerusalem and throughout our nation,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">and even to other nations, telling people everywhere that they must repent and turn to God and demonstrate it with a changed life.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">That&apos;s why the Jews seized me when I was in the temple and tried to murder me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">&apos;But in spite of all this, I have experienced the supernatural help of God up to this very moment. So I&apos;m standing here saying the same thing that I&apos;ve shared with everyone, from the least to the greatest. For I teach nothing but what</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">Moses and the prophets have said was destined to happen: that our Messiah had to suffer and die and be the first to rise from the dead,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">to release the bright light of truth both to our people and to the non-Jewish nations.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">Festus interrupted Paul&apos;s defense,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">blurting out, &apos;You&apos;re out of your mind! All this great learning of yours is driving you crazy.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">Paul replied, &apos;No, Your Excellency Festus, I am not crazy. I speak the words of truth and reason.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">King Agrippa, I know I can speak frankly and freely with you, for you understand these matters well, and none of these things have escaped your notice. After all, it&apos;s not like it was a secret!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">Don&apos;t you believe the prophets, King Agrippa? I know that you do.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">Agrippa responded, &apos;In such a short time you are nearly persuading me to become a Christian.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">Paul replied, &apos;I pray to God that both you and those here listening to me would one day become the same as I am, except, of course, without these chains.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">The king, the governor, Bernice, and all the others got up.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">As they were leaving the chamber, they commented to one another, &apos;This man has done nothing that deserves death or even imprisonment.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">King Agrippa said to Festus, &apos;If he hadn&apos;t appealed to Caesar, he could have been released.&apos;</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="27">
			<VERS vnumber="1">When it was decided that we</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">were to sail for Italy, Festus handed over Paul and a number of other prisoners to the custody of a Roman officer named Julius, a member of the imperial guard.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">We went on board a ship from the port of Adramyttium</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">that was planning to stop at various ports along the coast of southwestern Turkey.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">We put out to sea and were accompanied by Aristarchus</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">from Thessalonica in Macedonia.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">The next day we docked at Sidon,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">and Julius, being considerate of Paul, allowed him to disembark and be refreshed by his friends living there.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">From there we put out to sea, but because the winds</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">were against us, we sailed under the lee of Cyprus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">After sailing across the open sea off Cilicia and Pamphylia, we docked at the port of Myra in Lycia.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">While we were there, the commanding officer found an Egyptian ship from Alexandria that was bound for Italy, and he put us on board.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">We made little headway for several days, and with difficulty we made it to Knidus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">The strong winds kept us from holding our course, so from there we sailed along the lee of Crete,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">opposite Cape Salome.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Hugging the coast, we struggled on to a place called Fair Havens, near the town of Lasea.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">We remained there a long time, until we passed the day of the Jewish fast. Paul advised the frightened sailors that they should not put out to sea in such dangerous weather, saying,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">&apos;Men, I can see that our voyage would be disastrous for us and bring great loss, not only to our ship and cargo but also to our own lives.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">We should remain here</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">But the officer in charge was persuaded more by the ship&apos;s helmsman and captain</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">than he was by Paul.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">So the majority decided to put out to sea, since Fair Haven was an exposed harbor and not suitable to winter in. They had hoped to somehow reach the Cretan port of Phineka,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">which was a more suitable port because it was facing south.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">When a gentle south breeze began to blow, they assumed they could make it, so they pulled up anchor and sailed close to Crete.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">But it wasn&apos;t long before the weather abruptly worsened and a storm of hurricane force called the Nor&apos;easter</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">tore across the island and blew us out to sea.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">The sailors weren&apos;t able to turn the ship into the wind, so they gave up and let it be driven by the gale winds.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">As we passed to the lee of a small island called Cauda,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">we were barely able to get the ship&apos;s lifeboat under control,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">so the crew hoisted the dinghy aboard. The sailors used ropes and cables to undergird the ship,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">fearing they would run aground on the shoals of Syrtis.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">They lowered the drag anchor to slow its speed and let the ship be driven along.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">The next day, because of being battered severely by the storm, the sailors jettisoned the cargo,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">and by the third day they even threw the ship&apos;s tackle and rigging overboard.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">After many days of seeing neither the sun nor the stars, and with the violent storm continuing to rage against us, all hope of ever getting through it alive was abandoned.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">After being without food for a long time, Paul stepped before them all and said, &apos;Men, you should have obeyed</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">me and avoided all of this pain and suffering by not leaving Crete.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Now listen to me. Don&apos;t be depressed, for no one will perish&apos;only the ship will be lost.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">For God&apos;s angel visited me last night, the angel of my God, the God I passionately serve. He came and stood in front of me</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">and said, &apos;Don&apos;t be afraid, Paul. You are destined to stand trial before Caesar. And because of God&apos;s favor on you, he has given you the lives of everyone who is sailing with you.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">So men, keep up your courage! I know that God will protect you, just as he told me he would.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">But we must run aground on some island</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">to be saved</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">On the fourteenth night of being tossed about the Adriatic Sea, about midnight, the sailors sensed we were approaching land.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">So they took soundings and discovered that the water was about 120 feet deep.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">After sailing a short distance, they again took soundings and found it was only ninety feet deep.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">Fearing we would be dashed against a rocky coast, they dropped four anchors from the stern and waited for morning to come.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">Some sailors pretended to go down to drop anchors from the bow when in fact they wanted to lower the lifeboat into the sea and escape, abandoning ship.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">Paul said to the Roman officer and his soldiers, &apos;Unless you all stay together onboard the ship, you have no chance of surviving.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">At the moment they heard this, the soldiers cut the ropes of the dinghy and let it fall away.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">Just before daybreak, Paul urged everyone to eat. He said, &apos;Today makes two full weeks that you&apos;ve been in fearful peril and hunger, unable to eat a thing.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">Now eat and be nourished. For you&apos;ll all come through this ordeal without a scratch.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">Then Paul took bread and gave thanks to God</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">in front of them, broke it and began to eat.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">After they were satisfied, they threw the grain into the sea to lighten the ship.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">When daylight came, the sailors didn&apos;t recognize the land, but they noticed a cove with a sandy beach, so they decided to run the ship ashore.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">They cut away the anchors, leaving them in the sea, untied the ropes holding the rudders, and hoisted the foresail to the breeze to head for the beach.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">But they drifted into the rocky shoals between two depths of the sea, causing the ship to flounder still a distance from shore. The bow was stuck fast, jammed on the rocks, while the stern was being smashed by the pounding of the surf.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">The soldiers wanted to kill all the prisoners to prevent them from escaping.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43">But the Roman officer was determined to bring Paul safely through, so he foiled their attempts. He commanded the prisoners and crew who could swim to jump overboard and swim ashore.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44">The rest all managed to survive by clinging to planks and broken pieces of the ship, so that everyone scrambled to the shore uninjured.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="28">
			<VERS vnumber="1">After we had safely reached land, we discovered that the island we were on was Malta.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">The people who lived there showed us extraordinary kindness, for they welcomed us around the fire they had built because it was cold and rainy.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">When Paul had gathered an armful of brushwood and was setting it on the fire, a venomous snake was driven out by the heat and latched onto Paul&apos;s hand with its fangs.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">When the islanders saw the snake dangling from Paul&apos;s hand, they said to one another, &apos;No doubt about it, this guy is a murderer. Even though he escaped death at sea, Justice</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">has now caught up with him!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">But Paul shook the snake off, flung it into the fire, and suffered no harm at all.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Everyone watched him, expecting him to swell up or suddenly drop dead. After observing him for a long time and seeing that nothing unusual happened, they changed their minds and said, &apos;He must be a god!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">The Roman governor of the island, named Publius, had his estate nearby. He graciously welcomed us as his houseguests and showed us hospitality for the three days that we stayed with him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">His father lay sick in bed, suffering from fits of high fever and dysentery. So Paul went into his room, and after praying, placed his hands on him. He was instantly healed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">When the people of the island heard about this miracle, they brought all the sick to Paul, and they were also healed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">The islanders honored us greatly,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">and when we were preparing to set sail again, they gave us all the supplies we needed for our journey.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">After three months we put out to sea on an Egyptian ship from Alexandria that had wintered at the island. The ship had carved on its prow as its emblem the &apos;Heavenly Twins.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">When we landed at Syracuse,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">we stayed there for three days.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">From there we set sail for the Italian city of Rhegium. The day after we landed, a south wind sprang up that enabled us to reach Puteoli</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">in two days.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">There we found some believers, who begged us to stay with them for a week. Afterward, we made our way to Rome.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">When the believers were alerted we were coming, they came out to meet us at the Forum of Appius</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">while we were still a great distance from Rome</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Another group met us</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">at the Three Taverns.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">When Paul saw the believers, his heart was greatly encouraged and he thanked God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">When we finally entered Rome, Paul was turned over to the authorities and was allowed to live where he pleased, with one soldier assigned to guard him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">After three days Paul called together all the prominent members of the Jewish community of Rome.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">When they had all assembled, Paul said to them, &apos;My fellow Jews, while I was in Jerusalem, I was handed over as a prisoner of the Romans for prosecution, even though I had done nothing against any of our people or our Jewish customs.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">After hearing my case, the Roman authorities wanted to release me since they found nothing that deserved a death sentence.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">When the Jews objected to this, I felt it necessary, with no malice against them,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">to appeal to Caesar.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">This, then, is the reason I&apos;ve asked to speak with you, so that I could explain these things. It is only because I believe in the Hope of Israel that I am in chains before you.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">They replied, &apos;We haven&apos;t received any letters from the Jews of Judea, nor has anyone come to us with a bad report about you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">But we are anxious to hear you present your views regarding this Christian sect we&apos;ve been hearing about, for people everywhere are speaking against it.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">So they set a time to meet with Paul. On that day an even greater crowd gathered where he was staying. From morning until evening Paul taught them, opening up the truths of God&apos;s kingdom. With convincing arguments from both the Law and the Prophets, he tried to persuade them about Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">Some were converted, but others refused to believe. They argued back and forth,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">still unable to agree among themselves. They were about to leave when Paul made one last statement to them: &apos;The Holy Spirit stated it well when he spoke to your ancestors through the prophet Isaiah:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">&apos;I send you to this people to say to them, &apos;You will keep learning,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">but not understanding. You will keep staring at truth but not perceiving it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">For your hearts are hard and insensitive to me&apos;you must be hard of hearing! For you&apos;ve closed your eyes so that you won&apos;t be troubled by the truth, and you&apos;ve covered your ears so that you won&apos;t have to listen and be pierced by what I say. For then you would have to respond and repent, so that I could heal your hearts.&apos; &apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">&apos;So listen well. This wonderful salvation given by God is now being presented to the non-Jewish nations, and they will believe and receive it!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">Paul lived two more years in Rome, in his own rented quarters, welcoming all who came to visit.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">He continued to proclaim to all the truths of God&apos;s kingdom realm, teaching them about the Lord Jesus, the Anointed One, speaking triumphantly and without any restriction.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1">Paul, a loving and loyal servant</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">of the Anointed One,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">Jesus. He called me to be his apostle</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">and set me apart</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">with a mission to reveal God&apos;s wonderful gospel.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">I write to all his beloved chosen ones in Rome, for you are also called as holy ones.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">May his joyous grace and total well-being, flowing from our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ, rest upon you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">My commission is to preach the good news. Yet it is not entirely new, but the fulfillment of the hope promised to us through his prophets in the sacred Scriptures.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">For the gospel is all about God&apos;s Son. As a man he descended from David&apos;s royal lineage,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">but as the mighty Son of God he was raised from the dead and miraculously set apart</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">with a display of triumphant power supplied by the Spirit of Holiness.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">And now Jesus is our Lord and our Messiah.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Through him grace cascaded into us, empowering us with</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="5">so that we can win people from every nation into the obedience that comes from faith,</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="10">My desire and constant prayer is that I would succeed in coming to you, according to the plan and timing of God.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="11">some spiritual gift</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">that will empower you to stand strong in your faith.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Now, this means that when we come together and are side by side, something wonderful will be released. We can expect to be co-encouraged and co-comforted by each other&apos;s faith!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">So, my dear brothers and sisters, please don&apos;t interpret my failure to visit you as indifference, because many times I&apos;ve intended to come but have not been released</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">to do so up to now. For I long to enjoy a harvest of spiritual fruit</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">among you, like I have experienced among the nations.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Love obligates me to preach to everyone, to those who are among the elite and those who are among the outcasts,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">to those who are wise and educated as well as to those who are foolish and unlearned.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">This is why I am so excited</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="15">to you in Rome!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">I refuse to be ashamed of the wonderful message of God&apos;s liberating power unleashed in us through Christ! For I am thrilled to preach that everyone who believes is saved&apos;the Jew first,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">and then people everywhere!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">This gospel unveils a continual revelation of God&apos;s righteousness&apos;a perfect righteousness given to us when we believe. And it moves us from</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">receiving life through faith</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">, to</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">the power of living by</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">faith.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">This is what the Scripture means when it says: &apos;We are right with God through life-giving faith!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">For God in heaven unveils his holy anger</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">breaking forth against every form of sin, both toward ungodliness that lives in hearts and evil actions. For the wickedness of humanity deliberately smothers the truth and keeps people from acknowledging the truth about God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">In reality, the truth of God is known instinctively,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">for God has embedded this knowledge inside every human heart.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Opposition to truth cannot be excused on the basis of ignorance</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">because from the creation of the world, the invisible qualities</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">of God&apos;s nature have been made visible, such as his eternal power and transcendence. He has made his wonderful attributes easily perceived,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">for seeing the visible makes us understand the invisible.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">So then, this leaves everyone without excuse.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Throughout human history</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">the fingerprints of God were upon them,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">yet they refused to honor him as God or even be thankful for his kindness. Instead, they entertained corrupt and foolish thoughts about what God was like.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">This left them with nothing but misguided hearts, steeped in moral darkness.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Although claiming to be wise, they were in fact shallow fools.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">For only a fool would trade the unfading splendor of the immortal God to worship the fading image of other humans, idols made to look like people, animals, birds, and even creeping reptiles!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">This is why God lifted off his restraining hand and let them have full expression of their sinful and shameful desires. They were given over to moral depravity, dishonoring their bodies</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">by sexual perversion</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">among themselves&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">all because they traded the truth of God for a lie.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">They worshiped and served the things God made rather than the God who made all things&apos;glory and praises to him forever and ever! Amen!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">And because they thought it was worthless to embrace the true knowledge of God, God gave them over</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">to a worthless mind-set, to break all rules of proper conduct.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">Their sinful lives became full of every kind of evil,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">wicked schemes,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">greed,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">and cruelty. Their hearts overflowed with jealous cravings, and with conflict and strife, which drove them into hateful arguments and murder. They are deceitful liars full of hostility. They are gossips</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">who love to spread malicious slander. With inflated egos they hurl hateful insults at God, yet they are nothing more than arrogant boasters. They are rebels against their parents and totally immoral.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">They are senseless, faithless,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">ruthless, heartless, and completely merciless.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">Although they are fully aware of God&apos;s laws and proper order, and knowing that those who do all of these things deserve to die, yet they still go headlong into darkness, encouraging others to do the same and applauding them when they do!</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="2">
			<VERS vnumber="1">No matter who you are, before you judge the wickedness of others, you had better remember this: you are also without excuse, for you too are guilty of the same kind of things! When you judge others, and then do the same things they do, you condemn yourself.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">We know that God&apos;s judgment falls upon those who practice these things. God is always right, because he has all the facts.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">And no matter who you think you are, when you judge others who do these things and then do the same things yourself, what makes you think that you will escape God&apos;s judgment?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Do the riches of his extraordinary kindness make you take him for granted and despise him? Haven&apos;t you experienced how kind and understanding he has been to you? Don&apos;t mistake his tolerance for acceptance. Do you realize that all the wealth of his extravagant kindness</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">is meant to melt your heart and lead you into repentance?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">But because of your calloused heart and refusal to change direction, you are piling up wrath for yourself in the day of wrath, when God&apos;s righteous judgment is revealed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">For: He will give to each one in return for what he has done.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">For those living in constant goodness and doing what pleases him,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">seeking an unfading glory and honor and imperishable virtue, will experience eternal life.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">But those governed by selfishness and self-promotion, whose hearts are unresponsive to God&apos;s truth and would rather embrace unrighteousness, will experience the fullness of wrath.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Anyone who does evil can expect tribulation and distress&apos;to the Jew first and also to the non-Jew.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">But when we do what pleases God, we can expect unfading glory, true honor, and a continual peace&apos;to the Jew first and also to the non-Jew,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">for God sees us all without partiality.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">When people who have never been exposed to the laws of Moses commit sin, they will still perish for what they do. And those who are under the law of Moses and fail to obey it are condemned by the law.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">For it&apos;s not merely knowing the law</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">that makes you right with God, but doing all that the law says that will cause God to pronounce you innocent.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">For example, whenever people who don&apos;t possess the law</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">as their birthright commit sin, it still confirms that a &apos;law&apos; is present in their conscience. For when they instinctively do what the law requires, that becomes a &apos;law&apos; to govern them, even though they don&apos;t have Mosaic law.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">It demonstrates that the requirements of the law are woven into their hearts. They know what is right and wrong, for their conscience validates this &apos;law&apos; in their heart. Their thoughts correct</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">them in one instance and commend them in another.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">So this judgment will be revealed on the day when God, through Jesus the Messiah, judges the hidden secrets of people&apos;s hearts. And their response to my gospel will be the standard of judgment used in that day.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Now, you claim to be a Jew because you lean upon your trust in the law</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">and boast in your relationship with God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">And you claim to know the will of God, and to have the moral high ground because you&apos;ve been taught the law of Moses.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">You are also confident that you are a qualified guide to those who are &apos;blind,&apos; a shining light to those who live in darkness.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">You are confident that you are a true teacher of the foolish and immature,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">all because you have the treasury of truth and knowledge in the law of Moses.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">So let me ask you this: Why don&apos;t you practice what you preach? You preach, &apos;Don&apos;t steal!&apos; but are you a thief?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">You are swift to tell others, &apos;Don&apos;t commit adultery!&apos; but are you guilty of adultery? You say, &apos;I hate idolatry and false gods!&apos; but do you withhold from the true God what is due him?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">Even though you boast in the law, you dishonor God, the Lawgiver, when you break it!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">For your actions seem to fulfill what is written: &apos;God&apos;s precious name is cursed among the nations because of you.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">You trust in the covenant sign of circumcision</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">yet circumcision only has value if you faithfully keep the teachings of the law. But if you violate the law, you have invalidated your circumcision.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">And if the uncircumcised one faithfully keeps the law, won&apos;t his obedience make him more &apos;Jewish&apos; than the actual rite of circumcision?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">And won&apos;t the one who has never had the knife cut his foreskin be your judge when you break the law?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">You are not a Jew if it&apos;s only superficial&apos;for it&apos;s more than the surgical cut of a knife that makes you Jewish.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">But you are Jewish because of the inward act of spiritual circumcision&apos;a radical change that lays bare your heart. It&apos;s not by the principle of the written code,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">but by power of the Holy Spirit. For then your praise will not come from people, but from God himself!</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="3">
			<VERS vnumber="1">So then what is the importance of circumcision, and what advantage is there of being a Jew?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Actually, there are numerous advantages.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Most important, God</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">distinguished the Jews from all other people</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">by entrusting them with the revelation of his prophetic promises.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">But what if some were unfaithful to their divine calling? Does their unbelief weaken God&apos;s faithfulness?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Absolutely not! God will always be proven faithful and true to his word, while people are proven to be liars. This will fulfill what was written in the Scriptures: Your words will always be vindicated and you will rise victorious when you are being tried by your critics!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">But what if our wrong shows how right God is? Doesn&apos;t our bad serve the purpose of making God look good? (Of course, I&apos;m only speaking from a human viewpoint.) Would that infer that God is unfair when he displays his anger against wrongdoing?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Absolutely not! For if that were the case, how could God be the righteous judge of all the earth?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">So, if my lie brings into sharp contrast the brightness of God&apos;s truth, and if my lie accentuates his glory, then why should I be condemned as a sinner?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Is it proper for us to sin, just so good things may come? May it never be! Yet there are some who slander us and claim that is what we teach. They deserve to be condemned for even saying it!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">So, are we to conclude then that we Jews are superior to all others? Certainly not! For we have already proven</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">that both Jews and gentiles are all under the bondage of sin.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">And the Scriptures agree, for it is written: There is no one who always does what is right, no, not even one!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">There is no one with true spiritual insight, and there is no one who seeks after God alone.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">All have deliberately wandered from God&apos;s ways. All have become depraved and unfit. Kindness has disappeared from them all, not even one is good.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Their words release a stench, like the smell of death&apos;foul and filthy! Deceitful lies roll off their tongues. The venom of a viper drips from their lips.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Bitter profanity flows from their mouths, only meant to cut and harm.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">They are infatuated with violence and murder.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">They release ruin and misery wherever they go.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">They never experience the path of peace.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">They shut their eyes to the awe-inspiring God!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Now, we realize that everything the law says is addressed to those who are under its authority. This is for two reasons: So that every excuse will be silenced,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">with no boasting of innocence</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">And so that the entire world will be held accountable to God&apos;s standards.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">For by the merit of observing the law no one earns the status of being declared righteous before God, for it is the law that fully exposes and unmasks the reality of sin.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">for we all have sinned and are in need of the glory of God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">Yet through his powerful declaration of acquittal, God freely gives away his righteousness. His gift</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">of love and favor now cascades over us, all because Jesus, the Anointed One, has liberated us from</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">the guilt, punishment, and power of</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">sin!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">Jesus&apos; God-given destiny</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">was to be the sacrifice to take away sins, and now he is our mercy seat</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">because of his death on the cross. We come to him for mercy, for God has made a provision for us to be forgiven by faith in the sacred blood of Jesus. This is the perfect demonstration of God&apos;s justice, because until now, he had been so patient&apos;holding back his justice out of his tolerance for us. So he covered over</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">the sins of those who lived prior to Jesus&apos; sacrifice.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">And when the season of tolerance came to an end, there was only one possible way for God to give away his righteousness and still be true to both his justice and his mercy&apos;to offer up his own Son. So now, because we stand on the faithfulness of Jesus,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">God declares us righteous in his eyes!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">Where, then, is there room for boasting? Do our works bring God&apos;s acceptance? Not at all! It was not our works of keeping the law but our faith</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">in his finished work</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">that makes us right with God</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">So our conclusion is this: God&apos;s wonderful declaration that we are righteous</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">in his eyes can only come when we put our faith in Christ, and not in keeping the law.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">After all, is God the God of the Jews only, or is he equally the God for all of humanity? Of course, he&apos;s the God of all people!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">Since there is only one God, he will treat us all the same&apos;he eliminates our guilt and makes us right with him by faith no matter who we are.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">Does emphasizing our faith invalidate the law? Absolutely not. Instead, our faith establishes the role the law should rightfully have.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="4">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Let me use Abraham as an example. It is clear that humanly speaking, he was the founder of Judaism. What was his experience of being made right with God?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Was it by his good works of keeping the law? No. For if it was by the things he did, he would have something to boast about, but no one boasts before God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Listen to what the Scriptures say: Because Abraham believed God&apos;s words, his faith transferred God&apos;s righteousness into his account.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">When people work, they earn wages. It can&apos;t be considered a free gift, because they earned it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">But no one earns God&apos;s righteousness. It can only be transferred when we no longer rely on our own works, but believe in the one who powerfully declares the ungodly to be righteous</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">in his eyes. It is faith that transfers God&apos;s righteousness into your account!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Even King David himself speaks to us regarding the complete wholeness that comes inside a person when God&apos;s powerful declaration of righteousness is heard over our life. Apart from our works, God&apos;s work is enough.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Here&apos;s what David says: What happy fulfillment is ahead for those whose rebellion has been forgiven and whose sins are covered by blood .</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">What happy progress comes to them when they hear the Lord speak over them, &apos;I will never hold your sins against you!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Now, think about it. Does this happiness come only to the Jews, or is it available to all who believe?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Our answer is this: faith was credited to Abraham as God&apos;s righteousness!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">How did he receive this gift of righteousness? Was he circumcised at the time God accepted him, or was he still uncircumcised? Clearly, he was an uncircumcised gentile when God said this of him!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">It was later that he received the external sign of circumcision as a seal to confirm that God had already transferred his righteousness to him by faith, while he was still uncircumcised. So now this qualifies him to become the father of all who believe among the non-Jewish people. And like their &apos;father of faith,&apos; Abraham, God also transfers his righteousness to them by faith.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Yes, Abraham is obviously the true father of faith for the Jewish people who are not only circumcised but who walk in the way of faith that our father Abraham displayed before his circumcision.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">God promised Abraham and his descendants that they would have an heir who would reign over the world.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">This royal promise was not fulfilled because Abraham kept all the law, but through the righteousness that was transferred by faith.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">For if keeping the law earns the inheritance, then faith is robbed of its power and the promise becomes useless.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">For the law provokes punishment, and where no law exists there cannot be a violation of the law.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">The promise depends on faith so that it can be experienced as a grace-gift, and now it extends to all the descendants of Abraham. This promise is not only meant for those who obey the law, but also to those who enter into the faith of Abraham, the father of us all.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">That&apos;s what the Scripture means when it says: &apos;I have made you the father of many nations.&apos; He is our example and father, for in God&apos;s presence he believed that God can raise the dead and call into being things that don&apos;t even exist yet.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Against all odds, when it looked hopeless, Abraham believed the promise and expected God to fulfill it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">He took God at his word, and as a result he became the father of many nations. God&apos;s declaration over him came to pass: &apos;Your descendants will be so many that they will be impossible to count!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">In spite of being nearly one hundred years old when the promise of having a son was made, his faith was so strong that it could not be undermined by the fact that he and Sarah</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">were incapable of conceiving a child.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">So now you can see why Abraham&apos;s faith was credited to his account as righteousness before God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">And this declaration was not just spoken over Abraham,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">but also over us. For when we believe and embrace the one who brought our Lord Jesus back to life, perfect righteousness will be credited to our account as well.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">Jesus was handed over to be crucified for the forgiveness of our sins and was raised back to life to prove that he had made us right with God!</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="5">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Our faith in Jesus transfers God&apos;s righteousness to us and he now declares us flawless in his eyes.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">This means we can now enjoy true and lasting peace</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">with God, all because of what our Lord Jesus, the Anointed One, has done for us.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Our faith guarantees us permanent access into this marvelous kindness</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">that has given us a perfect relationship with God. What incredible joy bursts forth within us as we keep on celebrating our hope of experiencing God&apos;s glory!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">But that&apos;s not all! Even in times of trouble we have a joyful confidence, knowing that our pressures</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">will develop in us patient endurance.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">And patient endurance will refine our character, and proven character leads us back to hope.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">And this hope is not a disappointing fantasy,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">because we can now experience the endless love of God cascading into our hearts through the Holy Spirit who lives in us!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">For when the time was right, the Anointed One came and died</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">to demonstrate his love</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">for sinners who were entirely helpless, weak, and powerless to save themselves.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Now, would anyone dare to die for the sake of a wicked person?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">We can all understand if someone was willing to die for a truly noble person.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">But Christ proved God&apos;s passionate love for us by dying in our place while we were still lost and ungodly!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">And there is still much more to say of his unfailing love for us! For through the blood of Jesus we have heard the powerful declaration, &apos;You are now righteous in my sight.&apos; And because of the sacrifice of Jesus, you will never experience the wrath</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">of God</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">So if while we were still enemies, God fully reconciled</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">us to himself through the death of his Son, then something greater than friendship is ours. Now that we are at peace with God, and because we share in his</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">resurrection</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">life, how much more we will be rescued from sin&apos;s dominion!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">And even more than that, we overflow with triumphant joy</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">in our new relationship of living reconciled to God&apos;all because of Jesus Christ!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">When Adam sinned, the entire world was affected. Sin entered human experience, and death was the result. And so death followed this sin,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">casting its shadow over all humanity, because all have sinned.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Sin was in the world before Moses gave the written law, but it was not charged against them where no law existed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Yet death reigned</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">as king from Adam to Moses even though they hadn&apos;t broken a command</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">the way Adam had</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">. The first man, Adam, was a picture</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">of the Messiah, who was to come.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Now, there is no comparison between Adam&apos;s transgression and the gracious gift that we experience.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">For the magnitude of the gift far outweighs the crime</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">It&apos;s true that many died because of one man&apos;s transgression, but how much greater will God&apos;s grace and his gracious gift of acceptance overflow</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">to many because of what one man, Jesus, the Messiah, did for us!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">And this free-flowing gift imparts to us much more than what was given to us through the one who sinned. For because of one transgression, we are all facing a death sentence with a verdict of &apos;Guilty!&apos; But this gracious gift leaves us free from our many failures</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">and brings us into the perfect righteousness of God&apos;acquitted with the words &apos;Not guilty!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Death once held us in its grip, and by the blunder of one man, death reigned as king over humanity. But now, how much more</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">are we held in the grip of grace and continue reigning as kings in life, enjoying our regal freedom through the gift of perfect righteousness</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">in the one and only Jesus, the Messiah!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">In other words, just as condemnation came upon all people through one transgression, so through one righteous act</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">of Jesus&apos; sacrifice</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">, the perfect righteousness that makes us right with God and leads us to a victorious life</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">is now available to all.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">One man&apos;s disobedience opened the door for all humanity to become sinners. So also one man&apos;s obedience opened the door for many to be made perfectly right with God and acceptable to him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">So then, the law was introduced into God&apos;s plan to bring the reality of human sinfulness out of hiding. And yet, wherever sin increased, there was more than enough of God&apos;s grace to triumph all the more!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">And just as sin reigned through death, so also this sin-conquering grace will reign as king through righteousness, imparting eternal life through Jesus, our Lord and Messiah!</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="6">
			<VERS vnumber="1">So what do we do, then? Do we persist in sin so that God&apos;s kindness and grace will increase?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">What a terrible thought! We have died to sin once and for all, as a dead man passes away from this life. So how could we live under sin&apos;s rule a moment longer?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Or have you forgotten that all of us who were immersed into union with Jesus, the Anointed One, were immersed into union with his death?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Sharing in his death by our baptism means that we were co-buried with him, so that when the Father&apos;s glory raised Christ from the dead, we were also raised with him. We have been co-resurrected with him so that we could be empowered to walk in the freshness of new life.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">For since we are permanently grafted into him</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">to experience a death like his, then we are permanently grafted into him to experience a resurrection like his and the new life that it imparts.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Could it be any clearer</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">that our former identity</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">is now and forever deprived of its power? For we were co-crucified with him to dismantle the stronghold of sin within us,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">so that we would not continue to live one moment longer submitted to sin&apos;s power.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Obviously, a dead person is incapable of sinning.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">And if we were co-crucified with the Anointed One, we know that we will also share in the fullness of his life.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">And we know that since the Anointed One has been raised from the dead to die no more, his resurrection life has vanquished death and its power over him is finished.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">For by his sacrifice he died to sin&apos;s power once and for all,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">but he now lives continuously for the Father&apos;s pleasure.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">So let it be the same way with you! Since you are now joined with him, you must continually view yourselves as dead and unresponsive to sin&apos;s appeal while living daily for God&apos;s pleasure in union with Jesus, the Anointed One.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Sin is a dethroned monarch; so you must no longer give it an opportunity to rule over your life, controlling how you live and compelling you to obey its desires and cravings.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">So then, refuse to answer its call to surrender your body as a tool for wickedness. Instead, passionately answer God&apos;s call to keep yielding your body to him as one who has now experienced resurrection life! You live now for his pleasure, ready to be used for his noble purpose.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Remember this: sin will not conquer you, for God already has! You are not governed by law but governed by the reign of the grace of God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">What are we to do, then? Should we sin to our hearts&apos; content since there&apos;s no law to condemn us anymore? What a terrible thought!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Don&apos;t you realize that grace frees you to choose your own master? But choose carefully, for you surrender yourself to become a servant&apos;bound to the one you choose to obey. If you choose to love sin, it will become your master, and it will own you and reward you with death. But if you choose to love and obey God, he will lead you into perfect righteousness.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">And thanks be to God, for in the past you were servants of sin, but now your obedience is heart deep, and your life is being molded by truth through the teaching you are devoted to.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">And now you celebrate your freedom from your former master&apos;sin. You&apos;ve left its bondage, and now God&apos;s perfect righteousness holds power over you as his loving servants.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">I&apos;ve used the familiar terms of a &apos;servant&apos; and a &apos;master&apos; to compensate for your weakness to understand. For just as you surrendered your bodies and souls to impurity and lawlessness, which only brought more lawlessness into your lives, so now surrender yourselves as servants of righteousness, which brings you deeper into true holiness.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">For when you were bound as servants to sin, you lived your lives free from any obligation to righteousness.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">So tell me, what benefit ensued from doing those things that you&apos;re now ashamed of? It left you with nothing but a legacy of shame and death.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">But now, as God&apos;s loving servants, you live in joyous freedom from the power of sin. So consider the benefits you now enjoy&apos;you are brought deeper into the experience of true holiness that ends with eternal life!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">For sin&apos;s meager wages is death,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">but God&apos;s lavish gift is life eternal, found in your union with our Lord Jesus, the Anointed One.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="7">
			<VERS vnumber="1">I write to you, dear brothers and sisters, who are familiar with the law. Don&apos;t you know that when a person dies, it ends his obligation to the law?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">For example, a married couple is bound by the law to remain together until separated by death. But when one spouse dies, the other is released from the law of the marriage.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">So then if a wife is joined to another man while still married, she commits adultery. But if her husband dies, she is obviously free from the marriage contract and may marry another man without being charged with adultery.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">So, my dear brothers and sisters, the same principle applies to your relationship with God. For you died to</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">your first husband</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">, the law, by being co-crucified with the body of the Messiah. So you are now free to &apos;marry&apos; another&apos;the one who was raised from the dead so that you may now bear spiritual fruit</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">for God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">When we were merely living natural lives,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">the law,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">through defining sin</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">, actually awakened sinful desires within us, which resulted in bearing the fruit of death.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">But now that we have been fully released from the power of the law, we are dead to what once controlled us. And our lives are no longer motivated by the obsolete way of following the written code,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">so that now we may serve God by living in the freshness of a new life in the power of the Holy Spirit.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">So, what shall we say about all this? Am I suggesting that the law is sinful? Of course not! In fact, it was the law that gave us the clear definition of sin. For example, when the law said, &apos;Do not covet,&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">it became the catalyst to see how wrong it was for me to crave what belongs to someone else.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">It was through God&apos;s commandment that sin was awakened in me and built its base of operation</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">within me to stir up every kind of wrong desire. For in the absence of the law, sin hides dormant.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Sin, by means of the commandment, built a base of operation within me, to overpower me</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">and put me to death.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">So then, we have to conclude that the problem is not with the law itself, for the law is holy and its commandments are correct and for our good.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">So, did something meant to be good become death to me? Certainly not! It was not the law but sin unmasked that produced my spiritual death. The sacred commandment merely uncovered the evil of sin so it could be seen for what it is.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">For we know that the law is divinely inspired and comes from the spiritual realm,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">but I am a human being made of flesh and trafficked as a slave under sin&apos;s authority.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">I&apos;m a mystery to myself,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">for I want to do what is right, but end up doing what my moral instincts condemn.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">And if my behavior is not in line with my desire, my conscience still confirms the excellence of the law.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">And now I realize that it is no longer my true self doing it, but the unwelcome intruder of sin in my humanity.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">For I know that nothing good lives within the flesh of my fallen humanity. The longings to do what is right are within me, but willpower is not enough to accomplish it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">My lofty desires to do what is good are dashed when I do the things I want to avoid.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">So if my behavior contradicts my desires to do good, I must conclude that it&apos;s not my true identity doing it, but the unwelcome intruder of sin</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">hindering me from being who I really am</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Through my experience of this principle, I discover that even when I want to do good, evil is ready to sabotage me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Truly, deep within my true identity, I love to do what pleases God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">But I discern another power operating in my humanity, waging a war against the moral principles of my conscience</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">and bringing me into captivity as a prisoner to the &apos;law&apos; of sin&apos;this unwelcome intruder in my humanity.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">What an agonizing situation I am in! So who has the power to rescue this miserable man from the unwelcome intruder of sin and death?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">I give all my thanks to God, for his mighty power has finally provided a way out through our Lord Jesus, the Anointed One! So if left to myself, the flesh is aligned with the law of sin, but now my renewed mind is fixed on and submitted to God&apos;s righteous principles.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="8">
			<VERS vnumber="1">So now the case is closed</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">. There remains no accusing voice of condemnation against those who are joined in life-union with Jesus, the Anointed One.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">For the &apos;law&apos; of the Spirit of life flowing through the anointing of Jesus has liberated us</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">from the &apos;law&apos; of sin and death.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">For God achieved what the law was unable to accomplish, because the law was limited by the weakness of human nature. Yet God sent us his Son in human form to identify with human weakness. Clothed with humanity, God&apos;s Son gave his body to be the sin-offering so that God could once and for all condemn the guilt and power of sin.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">So now every righteous requirement of the law can be fulfilled through the Anointed One living his life in us. And we are free to live, not according to our flesh, but by the dynamic power of the Holy Spirit!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Those who are motivated by the flesh only pursue what benefits themselves. But those who live by the impulses of the Holy Spirit are motivated to pursue spiritual realities.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">For the sense and reason of the flesh is death, but the mind-set controlled by the Spirit finds life and peace.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">In fact, the mind-set focused on the flesh fights God&apos;s plan and refuses to submit to his direction,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">because it cannot!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">For no matter how hard they try, God finds no pleasure with those who are controlled by the flesh.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">But when the Spirit of Christ empowers your life,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">you are not dominated by the flesh but by the Spirit. And if you are not joined to the Spirit of the Anointed One, you are not of him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Now Christ lives his life in you! And even though your body may be dead because of the effects of sin, his life-giving Spirit imparts life to you because you are fully accepted by God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Yes, God raised Jesus to life! And since God&apos;s Spirit of Resurrection lives in you, he will also raise your dying body to life by the same Spirit that breathes life into you!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">So then, beloved ones, the flesh has no claims on us at all, and we have no further obligation to live in obedience to it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">For when you live controlled by the flesh, you are about to die. But if the life of the Spirit puts to death the corrupt ways of the flesh, we then taste his abundant life.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">The mature children of God are those</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">who are moved by the impulses of the Holy Spirit.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">And you did not receive the &apos;spirit of religious duty,&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">leading you back into the fear</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">of never being good enough</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">But you have received the &apos;Spirit of full acceptance,&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">enfolding you into the family of God. And you will never feel orphaned, for as he rises up within us, our spirits join him in saying the words of tender affection, &apos;Beloved Father!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">For the Holy Spirit makes God&apos;s fatherhood real to us as he whispers into our innermost being, &apos;You are God&apos;s beloved child!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">And since we are his true children, we qualify to share all his treasures, for indeed, we are heirs of God himself. And since we are joined to Christ, we also inherit all that he is and all that he has.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">We will experience being co-glorified with him provided that we accept his sufferings</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">as our own.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">I am convinced that any suffering we endure is less than nothing compared to the magnitude of glory</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">that is about to be unveiled within us.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">The entire universe is standing on tiptoe,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">yearning to see the unveiling of God&apos;s</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">glorious</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">sons and daughters!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">For against its will the universe itself has had to endure the empty futility</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">resulting from the consequences of human sin. But now, with eager expectation,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">all creation longs for freedom from its slavery to decay and to experience with us the wonderful freedom coming to God&apos;s children.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">To this day we are aware of the universal agony and groaning of creation, as if it were in the contractions of labor for childbirth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">And it&apos;s not just creation. We who have already experienced the firstfruits of the Spirit</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">also inwardly groan as we passionately long to experience our full status as God&apos;s sons and daughters&apos;including our physical bodies being transformed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">For this is the hope of our salvation. But hope means that we must trust and wait for what is still unseen. For why would we need to hope for something we already have?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">So because our hope is set on what is yet to be seen, we patiently keep on waiting for its fulfillment.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">And in a similar way, the Holy Spirit takes hold of us in our human frailty to empower us in our weakness. For example, at times we don&apos;t even know how to pray, or know the best things to ask for. But the Holy Spirit rises up within us to super-intercede</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">on our behalf, pleading to God with emotional sighs</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">too deep for words.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">God, the searcher of the heart, knows fully our longings,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">yet he also understands the desires of the Spirit, because the Holy Spirit passionately pleads before God for us, his holy ones, in perfect harmony with God&apos;s plan and our destiny.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">So we are convinced that every detail of our lives is continually woven together for good,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">for we are his lovers who have been called to fulfill his designed purpose.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">For he knew all about us before we were born and he destined us</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">from the beginning to share the likeness of his Son. This means the Son is the oldest among a vast family of brothers and sisters who will become just like him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">Having determined our destiny ahead of time, he called us to himself and transferred his perfect righteousness to everyone he called. And those who possess his perfect righteousness he co-glorified with his Son!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">So, what does all this mean? If God has determined to stand with us, tell me, who then could ever stand against us?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">For God has proved his love by giving us his greatest treasure, the gift of his Son. And since God freely offered him up as the sacrifice for us all,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">he certainly won&apos;t withhold from us anything else he has to give.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">Who then would dare to accuse those whom God has chosen in love to be his? God himself is the judge who has issued his final verdict over them&apos;&apos;Not guilty!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">Who then is left to condemn us? Certainly not Jesus, the Anointed One! For he gave his life for us, and even more than that, he has conquered death and is now risen, exalted, and enthroned by God at his right hand. So how could he possibly condemn us since he is continually praying</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">for our triumph</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">Who could ever divorce us from the endless love of God&apos;s Anointed One?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">Absolutely no one!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">For nothing in the universe has the power to diminish his love toward us. Troubles, pressures, and problems are unable to come between us and heaven&apos;s love. What about persecutions, deprivations,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">dangers, and death threats? No, for they are all impotent to hinder omnipotent love,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">even though it is written: All day long we face death threats for your sake, God. We are considered to be nothing more than sheep to be slaughtered!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">Yet even in the midst of all these things, we triumph over them all, for God has made us to be more than conquerors,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">and his demonstrated love is our glorious victory over everything!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">So now I live with the confidence that there is nothing in the universe with the power to separate us from God&apos;s love. I&apos;m convinced that his love will triumph over death, life&apos;s troubles,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">fallen angels, or dark rulers in the heavens. There is nothing in our present or future circumstances that can weaken his love.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">There is no power above us or beneath us&apos;no power that could ever be found in the universe that can distance us from God&apos;s passionate love, which is lavished upon us through our Lord Jesus, the Anointed One!</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="9">
			<VERS vnumber="5">We trace our beginnings back to the patriarchs, and through their bloodline is the genealogy of the Messiah, who is God over everything. May he be praised through endless ages! Amen!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Clearly, God has not failed to fulfill his promises to Israel, for that will never happen! But not everyone who has descended from Israel belongs to Israel.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Physical descent from Abraham doesn&apos;t guarantee the inheritance, because God has said: &apos;Through Isaac your descendants will be counted as part of your lineage .&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">This confirms that it is not merely the natural offspring of Abraham who are considered the children of God; rather, the children born because of God&apos;s promise</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">are counted as descendants.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">For God promised Abraham: &apos;Now is the time! For in nine months your wife, Sarah, will have a son!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Now, this son was our ancestor, Isaac, who, with his wife, Rebekah, conceived twins.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">For in the words of Scripture: &apos;Jacob I have chosen, but Esau I have rejected.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">So, what does all this mean? Are we saying that God is unfair? Of course not!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">He had every right to say to Moses: &apos;I will be merciful to whomever I choose and I will show compassion to whomever I wish.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Again, this proves that God&apos;s choice doesn&apos;t depend on how badly someone wants it or tries to earn it,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">but it depends on God&apos;s kindness and mercy.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">For just as God said to Pharaoh: &apos;I raised you up as ruler of Egypt for this reason, that I might make you an example of how I demonstrate my miracle power. For by the example of how I deal with you, my powerful name will be a message proclaimed throughout the earth!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">So again we see that it is entirely up to God to show mercy or to harden</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">the hearts of whomever he chooses.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Well then, one might ask, &apos;If God is in complete control, how could he blame us? For who can resist whatever he wants done?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">But who do you think you are to second-guess God? How could a human being molded out of clay say to the one who molded him, &apos;Why in the world did you make me this way?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Or are you denying the right of the potter to make out of clay whatever he wants? Doesn&apos;t the potter have the right to make from the same lump of clay an elegant vase or an ordinary pot?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">And in the same way, although God has every right to unleash his anger and demonstrate his power, yet he is extremely patient with those who deserve wrath&apos;vessels prepared for destruction.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">And doesn&apos;t he also have the right</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">to release the revelation of the wealth of his glory to his vessels of mercy, whom God prepared beforehand to receive his glory?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">Even for us, whether we are Jews or non-Jews, we are those he has called to experience his glory.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">Remember the prophecy God gave in Hosea: &apos;To those who were rejected and not my people, I will say to them: &apos;You are mine.&apos; And to those who were unloved I will say: &apos;You are my darling.&apos; &apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">And: &apos;In the place where they were told, &apos;You are nobody,&apos; this will be the very place where they will be renamed &apos;Children of the living God.&apos; &apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">And the prophet Isaiah cries out to Israel: Though the children of Israel are as many as the sands of the seashore, only a remnant will be saved.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">For the Lord will act and carry out his word on the earth, and waste no time to accomplish it!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">Just as Isaiah saw it coming and prophesied: If the Lord God had not left us a remnant, we would have been destroyed like Sodom and left desolate like Gomorrah!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">So then, what does all this mean?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">Here&apos;s the irony</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">: The non-Jewish people, who weren&apos;t even pursuing righteousness, were the ones who seized it&apos;a perfect righteousness that is transferred by faith.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">Yet Israel, even though pursuing a legal righteousness,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">did not attain to it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">And why was that? Because they did not pursue the path of faith but insisted on pursuing righteousness by works,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">as if it could be seized another way.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">They were offended by the means of obtaining it</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">and stumbled over the stumbling stone,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">just as it is written: &apos;Be careful! I am setting in Zion a stone that will cause people to stumble, a rock of offense that will make them fall, but believers in him will not experience shame.&apos;</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="10">
			<VERS vnumber="1">My beloved brothers and sisters, the passionate desire of my heart and constant prayer to God is for my fellow Israelites to experience salvation.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">For I know that although they are deeply devoted to God, they are unenlightened.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">And since they&apos;ve ignored the righteousness God gives, wanting instead to be acceptable to God because of their own works, they&apos;ve refused to submit to God&apos;s faith-righteousness.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">For Christ is the end of the law.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">And because of him, God has transferred his perfect righteousness to all who believe.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Moses wrote long ago about the need to obey every part of the law in order to be declared right with God: &apos;The one who obeys these things must always live by them.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">But we receive the faith-righteousness that speaks an entirely different message: &apos;Don&apos;t for a moment think you need to climb into the heavens to find the Messiah and bring him down,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">or to descend into the underworld to bring him up from the dead.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">But the faith-righteousness we receive speaks to us in these words of Moses: &apos;God&apos;s living message is very close to you, as close as your own heart beating in your chest and as near as the tongue in your mouth.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">And what is God&apos;s &apos;living message&apos;? It is the revelation of faith for salvation,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">which is the message that we preach. For if you publicly declare with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will experience salvation.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">The heart that believes in him receives the gift of the righteousness of God&apos;and then the mouth confesses, resulting in salvation.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">For the Scriptures encourage us with these words: &apos;Everyone who believes in him will never be disappointed.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">So then faith eliminates the distinction between Jew and non-Jew, for he is the same Lord for all people. And he has enough treasures to lavish generously upon all who call on him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">And it&apos;s true: &apos;Everyone who calls on the Lord&apos;s name will experience new life.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">But how can people call on him for help if they&apos;ve not yet believed? And how can they believe in one they&apos;ve not yet heard of? And how can they hear the message of life if there is no one there to proclaim it?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">And how can the message be proclaimed if messengers have yet to be sent? That&apos;s why the Scriptures say: How welcome is the arrival of those proclaiming the joyful news of peace and of good things to come!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">But not everyone welcomes</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">the good news, as Isaiah said: Lord, is there anyone who hears and believes our message?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Faith, then, is birthed in a heart that responds to God&apos;s anointed utterance of the Anointed One.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Can it be that Israel hasn&apos;t heard the message? No, they have heard it, for: The voice has been heard throughout the world, and its message has gone to the ends of the earth!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">So again I ask, didn&apos;t Israel already understand that God&apos;s message was for others as well as for themselves?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Yes, they certainly did understand</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">, for Moses was the first</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">to state it: &apos;I will make you jealous of a people who are &apos;nobodies.&apos; And I will use people with no understanding to provoke you to anger.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">And Isaiah the fearless prophet dared to declare: &apos;Those who found me weren&apos;t even seeking me. I manifested myself before those who weren&apos;t even asking to know me!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Yet regarding Israel Isaiah says: &apos;With love I have held out my hands day after day, offering myself to this unbelieving and stubborn people!&apos;</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="11">
			<VERS vnumber="1">So then I ask you this question: did God really push aside and reject his people?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">Absolutely not! For I myself am a Jew, a descendant of Abraham, from the tribe of Benjamin.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">God has not rejected his chosen, destined people!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Haven&apos;t you heard Elijah&apos;s testimony in the Scriptures, and how he prays to God, agonizing over Israel?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">&apos;Lord, they&apos;ve murdered your prophets; they&apos;ve demolished your altars. Now I&apos;m the only one left and they want to kill me!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">But what was the revelation</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">God spoke to him in response? &apos; You are not alone . For I have preserved a remnant for myself&apos;seven thousand others who are faithful and have refused to worship Baal.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">And that is but one example of what God is doing in this age of fulfillment, for God&apos;s grace empowers his chosen remnant.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">And since it is by God&apos;s grace, it can&apos;t be a matter of their good works; otherwise, it wouldn&apos;t be a gift of grace, but earned by human effort.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">So then, Israel failed to achieve what it had strived for, but the divinely chosen remnant receives it by grace, while the rest were hardened</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">and unable to receive the truth</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Just as it is written: God granted them a spirit of deep slumber. He closed their eyes to the truth and prevented their ears from hearing up to this very day.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">And King David also prophesied this: May their table prove to be a snare and a trap to cause their ruin. Bring them the retribution they deserve.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Blindfold their eyes and don&apos;t let them see. Let them be stooped over continually.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">So, am I saying that Israel stumbled so badly that they will never get back up? Certainly not! Rather, it was because of their stumble that salvation now extends to all the non-Jewish people, in order to make Israel jealous and desire the very things that God has freely given them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">So if all the world is being greatly enriched through their failure, and through their fall great spiritual wealth is given to the non-Jewish people, imagine how much more will Israel&apos;s awakening</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">bring to us all!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Now, I speak to you who are not Jewish, since I am an apostle to reach the non-Jewish people. And I draw attention to this ministry as much as I can when I am among the Jews,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">hoping to make them jealous of what God has given to those who are not Jews, winning some of my people to salvation.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">For if their</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">temporary</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">rejection released the reconciling power of grace into the world, what will happen when Israel is reinstated and reconciled to God? It will unleash resurrection power throughout the whole earth!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Since Abraham and the patriarchs are consecrated and set apart for God, so also will their descendants be set apart.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">If the roots of a tree are holy and set apart for God, so too will be the branches.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">However, some of the branches have been pruned away. And you,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">who were once nothing more than a wild olive branch, God has grafted in&apos;inserting you among the remaining branches as a joint partner to share in the wonderful richness of the cultivated olive stem.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">So don&apos;t be so arrogant as to believe that you are superior to the natural branches. There&apos;s no reason to boast, for the new branches don&apos;t support the root, but you owe your life to the root that supports you!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">You might begin to think that some branches were pruned or broken off just to make room for you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Yes, that&apos;s true.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">They were removed because of their unbelief. But remember this: you are only attached by your faith. So don&apos;t be presumptuous, but stand in awe and reverence.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Since God didn&apos;t spare the natural branches that fell into unbelief, perhaps he won&apos;t spare you either!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">So fix your gaze on the simultaneous kindness</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">and strict justice</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">of God. How severely he treated those who fell into unbelief! Yet how tender and kind is his relationship with you. So keep on trusting in his kindness; otherwise, you also will be cut off.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">God is more than ready to graft back in the natural branches when they turn from clinging to their unbelief to embracing faith.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">For if God grafted you in, even though you were taken from what is by nature a wild olive tree, how much more can he reconnect the natural branches by inserting them back into their own cultivated olive tree!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">My beloved brothers and sisters, I want to share with you</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">a mystery</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">concerning Israel&apos;s future. For understanding this mystery will keep you from thinking you already know everything. A partial and temporary hardening to the gospel has come over Israel, which will last until the full number of non-Jews has come into God&apos;s family.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">And then God will bring all of Israel to salvation! The prophecy will be fulfilled that says: &apos;Coming from Zion will be the Savior, and he will turn Jacob away from evil.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">For this is my covenant promise with them when I forgive their sins.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">Now, many of the Jews are opposed to the gospel, but their opposition has opened the door of the gospel to you who are not Jewish. Yet they are still greatly loved by God because their ancestors were divinely chosen to be his.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">And when God chooses someone and graciously imparts gifts to him, they are never rescinded.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">You who are not Jews were once rebels against God, but now, because of their disobedience, you have experienced God&apos;s tender mercies.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">And now they are the rebels, and because of God&apos;s tender mercies to you, you can open the door to them to share in and enjoy what God has given to us!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">Actually, God considers all of humanity to be prisoners of their unbelief, so that he can unlock our hearts and show his tender mercies to all who come to him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">Who could ever wrap their minds around the riches of God, the depth of his wisdom, and the marvel of his perfect knowledge? Who could ever explain the wonder of his decisions</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">or search out the mysterious way he carries out his plans?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">For who has discovered how the Lord thinks or is wise enough to be the one to advise him in his plans?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">Or: &apos;Who has ever first given something to God that obligates God to owe him something in return?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">For out of him, the sustainer of everything, came everything, and now everything finds fulfillment in him. May all praise and honor be given to him forever! Amen!</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1">Beloved friends, what should be our proper response to God&apos;s marvelous mercies? To surrender yourselves to God to be his sacred, living sacrifices. And live in holiness, experiencing all that delights his heart. For this becomes your genuine expression of worship.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Stop imitating the ideals and opinions of the culture around you,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">but be inwardly transformed by the Holy Spirit through a total reformation of how you think. This will empower you to discern God&apos;s will as you live a beautiful life, satisfying and perfect in his eyes.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">God has given me grace to speak a warning about pride. I would ask each of you to be emptied of self-promotion and not create a false image of your importance. Instead, honestly assess your worth by using your God-given faith as the standard of measurement, and then you will see your true value with an appropriate self-esteem.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">In the human body there are many parts and organs, each with a unique function.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">And so it is in the body of Christ. For though we are many, we&apos;ve all been mingled into one body in Christ. This means that we are all vitally joined to one another, with each contributing to the others.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">God&apos;s marvelous grace imparts to each one of us varying gifts. So if God has given you the grace-gift of prophecy, activate your gift by using the proportion of faith you have to prophesy.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">If your grace-gift is serving, then thrive in serving others well. If you have the grace-gift of teaching, then be actively teaching and training others.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">If you have the grace-gift of encouragement,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">then use it often to encourage others. If you have the grace-gift of giving to meet the needs of others, then may you prosper in your generosity without any fanfare. If you have the gift of leadership, be passionate about your leadership. And if you have the gift of showing compassion,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">then flourish in your cheerful</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">display of compassion.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Let the inner movement of your heart always be to love one another, and never play the role of an actor wearing a mask. Despise evil and embrace everything that is good and virtuous.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Be devoted to tenderly loving your fellow believers</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">as members of one family</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">. Try to outdo yourselves in respect and honor of one another.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Be enthusiastic to serve the Lord, keeping your passion toward him boiling hot! Radiate with the glow of the Holy Spirit and let him fill you with excitement as you serve him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Let this hope burst forth within you, releasing a continual joy. Don&apos;t give up in a time of trouble,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">but commune with God at all times.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Take a constant interest in the needs of God&apos;s beloved people and respond by helping them. And eagerly welcome people as guests into your home.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Speak blessing, not cursing, over those who reject and persecute you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Celebrate with those who celebrate, and weep with those who grieve.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Live happily together in a spirit of harmony, and be as mindful of another&apos;s worth as you are your own. Don&apos;t live with a lofty mind-set, thinking you are too important to serve others, but be willing to do menial tasks and identify with those who are humble minded.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Don&apos;t be smug or even think for a moment that you know it all.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Never hold a grudge or try to get even, but plan your life around the noblest way to benefit others.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Do your best to live as everybody&apos;s friend.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Beloved, don&apos;t be obsessed with taking revenge, but leave that to God&apos;s righteous justice.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">For the Scriptures say: &apos;Vengeance is mine, and I will repay,&apos; says the Lord.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">And: If your enemy is hungry, buy him lunch! Win him over with kindness. For your surprising generosity will awaken his conscience, and God will reward you with favor.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Never let evil defeat you, but defeat evil with good.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="13">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Every person must submit to and support the authorities over him. For there can be no authority in the universe except by God&apos;s appointment, which means that every authority that exists has been instituted by God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">So to resist authority is to resist the divine order of God, which results in severe consequences.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">For civil authorities don&apos;t intimidate those who are doing good, but those who are doing evil. So do what is right and you&apos;ll never need to fear those in authority. They will commend you for your good citizenship.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Those in authority are God&apos;s servants for the good of society. But if you break the law, you have reason to be alarmed, for they are God&apos;s agents of punishment to bring criminals to justice. Why do you think they carry weapons?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">You are compelled to obey them, not just to avoid punishment, but because you want to live with a clean conscience.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">This is also the reason you pay your taxes, for governmental authorities are God&apos;s officials who oversee these things.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">So it is your duty to pay all the taxes and fees that they require and to respect those who are worthy of respect, honoring them accordingly.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Don&apos;t owe anything to anyone, except your outstanding debt to continually love one another,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">for the one who learns to love has fulfilled every requirement of the law.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">For the commandments, &apos;Do not commit adultery, do not murder, do not steal, do not covet,&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">and every other commandment can be summed up in these words: &apos;Love and value others the same way you love and value yourself.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Love makes it impossible to harm another, so love fulfills all that the law requires.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">To live like this is all the more urgent, for time is running out and you know it is a strategic hour in human history. It is time for us to wake up! For our full salvation</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">is nearer now than when we first believed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Night&apos;s darkness is dissolving away as a new day of destiny dawns.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">So we must once and for all strip away what is done in the shadows of darkness,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">removing it like filthy clothes</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">And once and for all we clothe ourselves with the radiance of light as our weapon.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">We must live honorably,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">surrounded by the light of this new day, not in the darkness of drunkenness</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">and debauchery,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">not in promiscuity and sensuality,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">not being argumentative or jealous of others.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Instead fully immerse yourselves into</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">the Lord Jesus, the Anointed One, and don&apos;t waste even a moment&apos;s thought on your former identity to awaken its selfish desires.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="14">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Offer an open hand of fellowship to welcome every true believer, even though their faith may be weak and immature. And refuse to engage in debates with them concerning nothing more than opinions.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">For example, one believer has no problem with eating all kinds of food, but another with weaker faith will eat only vegetables.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">The one who eats freely shouldn&apos;t judge and look down on the one who eats only vegetables. And the vegetarian must not judge and look down on the one who eats everything. Remember, God has welcomed him and taken him as his partner.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Who do you think you are to sit in judgment of someone else&apos;s household servant?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">His own master is the one to evaluate whether he succeeds or fails. And God&apos;s servants will succeed, for God&apos;s power</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">supports them and enables them to stand.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">In the same way, one person regards a certain day as more sacred than another, and another person regards them all alike. There is nothing wrong with having different personal convictions about such matters.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">For the person who observes one day as especially sacred does it to honor the Lord. And the same is true regarding what a person eats. The one who eats everything eats to honor the Lord, because he gives thanks to God, and the one who has a special diet does it to honor the Lord, and he also gives thanks to God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">No one lives to himself and no one dies to himself.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">While we live, we must live for our Master, and in death we must bring honor to him. So dead or alive we belong to our Master.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">For this very reason the Anointed One died and was brought back to life again, so that he would become the Lord God</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">over both the dead and the living.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Why would you judge your brothers or sisters because of their diet, despising them for what they eat or don&apos;t eat? For we each will have our turn to stand before God&apos;s judgment seat.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Just as it is written: &apos;As surely as I am the Living God, I tell you: &apos;Every knee will bow before me and every tongue will confess the truth and glorify me!&apos; &apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Therefore, each one must answer for himself and give a personal account of his own life before God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">So stop being critical and condemning of other believers, but instead determine to never deliberately cause a brother or sister to stumble</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">and fall because of your actions.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">I know and am convinced by personal revelation from the Lord Jesus that there is nothing wrong with eating any food. But to the one who considers it to be unclean, it is unacceptable.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">If your brother or sister is offended because you insist on eating what you want, it is no longer love that rules your conduct. Why would you wound someone for whom the Messiah gave his life, just so you can eat what you want?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">So don&apos;t give people the opportunity to slander what you know to be good.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">For the kingdom of God is not a matter of rules about food and drink, but is in the realm of the Holy Spirit,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">filled with righteousness,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">peace, and joy.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Serving the Anointed One by walking in these kingdom realities pleases God</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">and earns the respect of others.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">So then, make it your top priority to live a life of peace with harmony in your relationships,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">eagerly seeking to strengthen and encourage one another.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Stop ruining the work of God by insisting on your own opinions about food. You can eat anything you want,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">but it is wrong to deliberately cause someone to be offended over what you eat.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Consider it an act of love</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">to refrain from eating meat or drinking wine or doing anything else that would cause a fellow believer to be offended or tempted to be weakened in his faith.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Keep the convictions you have about these matters between yourself and God,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">and don&apos;t impose them upon others</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">. You&apos;ll be happy when you don&apos;t judge yourself in doing what your conscience approves.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">But the one who has misgivings feels miserable if he eats meat, because he doubts and doesn&apos;t eat in faith. For anything we do that doesn&apos;t spring from faith is, by definition, sinful.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="15">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Now, those who are mature</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">in their faith can easily be recognized, for they don&apos;t live to please themselves but have learned to patiently embrace others in their immaturity.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Our goal must be to empower others to do what is right and good for them, and to bring them into spiritual maturity.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">For not even</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">the most powerful one of all</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">, the Anointed One, lived to please himself. His life fulfilled the Scripture that says: All the insults of those who insulted you fall upon me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Whatever was written beforehand is meant to instruct us in how to live. The Scriptures impart to us encouragement and inspiration so that we can live in hope and endure all things.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Now may God, the source of great endurance and comfort, grace you with unity among yourselves, which flows from your relationship with Jesus, the Anointed One.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Then, with a unanimous rush of passion, you will with one voice glorify God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">You will bring God glory when you accept and welcome one another as partners, just as the Anointed One has fully accepted you and received you as his partner.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">I am convinced that Jesus, the Messiah, was sent as a servant to the Jewish people</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">to fulfill the promises God made to our ancestors and to prove God&apos;s faithfulness.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">And now, because of Jesus, the non-Jewish people of the world can glorify God for his kindness to them, fulfilling the prophecy of Scripture: Because of this I will proclaim you among the nations and they will hear me sing praises to your name.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">And in another place it says: &apos;You who are not Jewish, celebrate life right alongside his Jewish people.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">And again: Praise the Lord, all you who are not Jews, and let all the people of the earth raise their voices in praises to him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">And Isaiah prophesied: &apos;An heir to David&apos;s throne will emerge, and he will rise up as ruler over all the non-Jewish nations, for all their hopes will be met in him.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Now may God, the fountain of hope, fill you to overflowing with uncontainable joy and perfect peace as you trust in him. And may the power of the Holy Spirit continually surround your life with his super-abundance until you radiate with hope!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">My dear brothers and sisters, I am fully convinced of your genuine spirituality. I know that each of you is stuffed full of God&apos;s goodness, that you are richly supplied with all kinds of revelation-knowledge, and that you are empowered to effectively instruct</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">one another.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">And because of the outpouring of God&apos;s grace on my life to be his minister and to preach Jesus, the Anointed One, to the non-Jewish people, I have written rather boldly to you on some themes, reminding you of their importance.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">For this grace has made me a servant of the gospel of God, constantly doing the work of a priest, for I endeavor to present an acceptable offering to God; so that the non-Jewish people of the earth may be set apart and made holy by the Spirit of holiness.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Now then, it is through my union with Jesus Christ, that I enjoy an enthusiasm and confidence in my ministry for God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">It is my honor and constant passion to be a pioneer who preaches where no one has ever even heard of the Anointed One, instead of building upon someone else&apos;s foundation.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">As the Scriptures say: Those who know nothing about him will clearly see him, and those who have not heard will understand.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">My pursuit of this mission has prevented me many times from visiting you,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">but there is now nothing left to keep me in these regions. So many years I have longed to come and be with you!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">So on my way to Spain I hope to visit you as I pass through Rome. And after I have enjoyed fellowship with you for a while, I hope that you would help me financially on my journey.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">But now I&apos;m on my way to Jerusalem to encourage God&apos;s people and minister to them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">I am pleased to inform you that the believers of Macedonia and Greece</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">have made a generous contribution for the poor among the holy believers in Jerusalem.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">They were thrilled to have an opportunity to give back to the believers in Jerusalem. For indeed, they are deeply grateful for them and feel indebted because they brought them the gospel. Since the ethnic multitudes have shared in the spiritual wealth of the Jewish people, it is only right that the non-Jewish people share their material wealth with them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">So, when I have completed this act of worship and safely delivered the offering</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">to them in Jerusalem, I will set out for Spain and visit you on my way there.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">I am convinced that when I come to you, I will come packed full and loaded</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">with the blessings of the Anointed One!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">That&apos;s why I plead with you, because of our union with our Lord Jesus Christ, to be partners with me in your prayers to God. My dear brothers and sisters in the faith, with the love we share in the Holy Spirit, fight alongside me in prayer.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">Ask the Father to deliver me from the danger I face from the unbelievers in Judea. For I want to make sure that the contribution I carry for Jerusalem will be favorably received by God&apos;s holy ones.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">Then he will send me to you with great joy in the pleasure of God&apos;s will, and I will be spiritually refreshed by your fellowship.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">And now may the God who gives us his peace and wholeness</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">be with you all. Yes, Lord, so let it be!</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="2">I am sending her with this letter and ask that you shower her with your hospitality when she arrives. Embrace her with honor, as is fitting for one who belongs to the Lord and is set apart for him. So provide her whatever she may need, for she&apos;s been a great leader and champion</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="27">Now to God, the only source of wisdom, be glorious praises for endless ages through Jesus, the Anointed One! Amen! (Paul&apos;s letter was transcribed by Tertius in Corinth and sent from Corinth and carried to Rome by Phoebe.)</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="1">
			<VERS vnumber="1">From Paul, divinely appointed according to the plan of God, to be an apostle of the Anointed One, Jesus. Our fellow believer Sosthenes</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">joins me</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">in writing you this letter addressed to the community of God</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">throughout the city of Corinth. For you have been made pure, set apart in the Anointed One, Jesus. And God has invited you to be his devoted and holy people, and not only you, but everyone everywhere who calls on the name of our Lord Jesus Christ as their Lord, and ours also.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">May joyous grace</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">and endless peace be yours continually from our Father God and from our Lord Jesus, the Anointed One!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">I am always thanking my God for you because he has given you such free and open access to his grace through your union with Jesus, the Messiah.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">In him you have been made extravagantly rich in every way. You have been endowed with a wealth of inspired utterance</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">and the riches that come from your intimate knowledge of him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">For the reality of the truth of Christ is seen among you and strengthened</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">through your experience of him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">So now you aren&apos;t lacking any spiritual gift</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">as you eagerly await the unveiling</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">of the Lord Jesus, the Anointed One.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">He will keep you steady and strong to the very end, making your character mature so that you will be found innocent on the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">God is forever faithful and can be trusted to do this in you, for he has invited you to co-share the life of his Son,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Jesus, the Anointed One, our King!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">I urge you, my brothers and sisters, for the sake of the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, to agree to live in unity with one another</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">and put to rest any division that attempts to tear you apart.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Be restored</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">as one united body living in perfect harmony. Form a consistent choreography among yourselves, having a common perspective with shared values.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">My dear brothers and sisters,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">I have a serious concern I need to bring up with you</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">for I have been informed by those of Chloe&apos;s</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">house church</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">that you have been destructively arguing among yourselves.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">And I need to bring this up because each of you is claiming loyalty to different preachers. Some are saying, &apos;I am a disciple of Paul,&apos; or, &apos;I follow Apollos,&apos; or, &apos;I am a disciple of Peter the Rock,&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">and some, &apos;I belong</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">only</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">to Christ.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">But</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">let me ask you</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">, is Christ divided up into groups? Did I die on the cross for you? At your baptism did you pledge yourselves to follow Paul?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Thank God I only baptized two from Corinth&apos;Crispus and Gaius!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">So now no one can say that in my name I baptized others.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">(Yes, I also baptized Stephanus and his family. Other than that, I don&apos;t remember baptizing anyone else.)</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">For the Anointed One has sent me on a mission, not to see how many I could baptize,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">but to proclaim the good news. And I declare this message stripped of all philosophical arguments that empty the cross of its true power. For I trust in the all-sufficient cross of Christ alone.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">To preach the message</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">of the cross seems like sheer nonsense to those who are on their way to destruction, but to us who are being saved, it is the mighty power of God released within us.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">For it is written: I will dismantle the wisdom of the wise and I will invalidate the intelligence of the scholars.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">So where is the wise philosopher</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">who understands</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">? Where is the expert scholar</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">who comprehends</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">? And where is the skilled debater of our time</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">who could win a debate with God</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">? Hasn&apos;t God demonstrated that the wisdom of this world system is utter foolishness?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">For in his wisdom,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">God designed that all</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">the world&apos;s wisdom would be insufficient to lead people to the discovery of himself. He took great delight in baffling the wisdom of the world by using the simplicity of preaching the story of the cross</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">in order to save those who believe it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">For the Jews constantly demand to see miraculous signs, while those who are not Jews</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">constantly cling to the world&apos;s wisdom,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">but we preach the crucified Messiah. The Jews stumble over him and the rest of the world sees him as foolishness.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">But for those who have been chosen to follow him, both Jews and Greeks, he is God&apos;s mighty power, God&apos;s true wisdom, and our Messiah.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">For the &apos;foolish&apos; things of God have proven to be wiser than human wisdom. And the &apos;feeble&apos; things of God have proven to be far more powerful than any human ability.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">Brothers and sisters, consider who you were when God called you</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">to salvation</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">. Not many of you were wise scholars by human standards, nor were many of you in positions of power. Not many of you were considered the elite</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">when you answered God&apos;s call</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">But God chose those whom the world considers foolish to shame those who think they are wise, and God chose the puny and powerless to shame</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">the high and mighty.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">He chose the lowly, the laughable</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">in the world&apos;s eyes&apos;nobodies&apos;so that he would shame the somebodies. For he chose what is regarded as insignificant in order to supersede what is regarded as prominent,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">so that there would be no place for prideful boasting in God&apos;s presence.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">For it is not from man that we draw our life</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">but from God as we are being joined to Jesus, the Anointed One. And now he is our God-given wisdom, our virtue, our holiness, and our redemption.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">And this fulfills what is written: If anyone boasts, let him only boast in all that the Lord has done!</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="2">
			<VERS vnumber="1">My brothers and sisters,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">when I first came to proclaim to you the secrets</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">of God, I refused to come</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">as an expert</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">, trying to impress you with my eloquent speech and lofty wisdom.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">For while I was with you I was determined to be consumed with one topic&apos;Jesus, the crucified Messiah.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">I stood before you feeling inadequate, filled with reverence for God,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">and trembling</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">under the sense of the importance of my words</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">The message I preached and how I preached it was not an attempt to sway you with persuasive arguments but to prove to you the almighty power of God&apos;s Holy Spirit.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">For God intended that your faith not be established on man&apos;s wisdom but by trusting in his almighty power.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">However, there is a wisdom that we continually speak of when we are among the spiritually mature.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">It&apos;s wisdom that didn&apos;t originate in this present age, nor did it come from the rulers of this age who are in the process of being dethroned.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Instead, we</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">continually speak of this wonderful wisdom that comes from God, hidden before now in a mystery.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">It is his secret plan, destined</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">before the ages,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">to bring</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">us into glory.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">None of the rulers of this present world order understood it,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">for if they had, they never would have crucified the Lord of shining glory.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">This is why the Scriptures say: Things never discovered or heard of before, things beyond our ability to imagine &apos; these are the many things God has in store for all his lovers.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">But God now unveils these profound realities to us by the Spirit.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Yes, he has revealed to us his inmost heart and deepest mysteries through the Holy Spirit, who constantly explores all things.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">After all, who can really see into a person&apos;s heart and know his hidden impulses except for that person&apos;s spirit? So it is with God. His thoughts and secrets are only fully understood by his Spirit, the Spirit of God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">For we did not receive the spirit of this world system but the Spirit of God, so that we might come to understand and experience all that grace has lavished upon us.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">And we</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">articulate these realities with the words imparted to us by the Spirit and not with the words taught by human wisdom. We join together Spirit-revealed truths with Spirit-revealed words.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Someone living on an entirely human level</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">rejects</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">the revelations of God&apos;s Spirit, for they make no sense to him. He can&apos;t understand the revelations of the Spirit because they are only discovered by the illumination of the Spirit.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Those who live in the Spirit are able to carefully evaluate all things, and they are subject to the scrutiny of no one</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">but God</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">For Who has ever intimately known the mind of the Lord Yahweh well enough to become his counselor? Christ has , and we possess Christ&apos;s perceptions.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="3">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Brothers and sisters, when I was with you I found it impossible to speak to you as those who are spiritually mature people, for you are still dominated by the mind-set of the flesh. And because you are immature infants in Christ,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">I had to nurse you and feed you with &apos;milk,&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">not with the solid food</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">of more advanced teachings</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">, because you weren&apos;t ready for it. In fact, you are still not ready to be fed solid food,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">for you are living your lives dominated by the mind-set of the flesh. Ask yourselves: Is there jealousy among you? Do you compare yourselves with others? Do you quarrel</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">like children</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">and end up taking sides? If so, this proves that you are living your lives centered on yourselves, dominated by the mind-set of the flesh, and behaving like unbelievers.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">For when you divide yourselves up in groups&apos;a &apos;Paul group&apos; and an &apos;Apollos group&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">&apos;you&apos;re acting like people without the Spirit&apos;s influence.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Who is Apollos, really? Or who is Paul? Aren&apos;t we both just servants through whom you believed our message? Aren&apos;t each of us doing the ministry the Lord has assigned to us?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">I planted the church, and Apollos came and cared for it, but it was God who caused it to grow.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">This means the one who plants is not anybody special, nor the one who waters, for God is the one who brings the supernatural growth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Now, the one who plants and the one who waters are</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">equally important</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">and on the same team, but each will be rewarded for his own work.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">We are coworkers with God</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">and you are God&apos;s cultivated garden,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">the house he is building.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">God has given me unique gifts</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">as a skilled master builder</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">who lays a good foundation. Afterward another craftsman comes and builds on it. So builders beware! Let every builder do his work carefully, according to God&apos;s standards.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">For no one is empowered to lay an alternative foundation other than the good foundation that exists, which is Jesus Christ!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">If his work stands the test of fire, he will be rewarded.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">If his work is consumed by the fire, he will suffer great loss. Yet he himself will barely escape destruction, like one being rescued out of a burning house.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Don&apos;t you realize that together you have become God&apos;s inner sanctuary</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">and that the Spirit of God makes his permanent home in you?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Now, if someone desecrates</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">God&apos;s inner sanctuary, God will desecrate him, for God&apos;s inner sanctuary is holy, and that is exactly who you are.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">So why fool yourself and live under an illusion?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Make no mistake about it, if anyone thinks he is wise by the world&apos;s standards, he will be made wiser by being a fool for God!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">For what the world says is wisdom is actually foolishness in God&apos;s eyes. As it is written: The cleverness of the know-it-alls becomes the trap that ensnares them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">And again: The Lord sees right through the clever reasonings of the wise and knows that it&apos;s all a sham.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">So don&apos;t be proud of your allegiance to any human leader. For actually, you already have everything! It has all been given for your benefit,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">whether it is Paul or Apollos or Peter the Rock,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">or whether it&apos;s the world</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">or life or death,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">or whether it&apos;s the present or the future&apos;everything belongs to you!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">And now you are joined to the Messiah, who is joined to God.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="4">
			<VERS vnumber="1">So then you must perceive us&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">not as leaders of factions</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">, but as servants</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">of the Anointed One, those who have been entrusted</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">with God&apos;s mysteries.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">The most important quality of one entrusted with such secrets is that they are faithful and trustworthy.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">But personally, I&apos;m not the least bit concerned if I&apos;m judged by you or any verdict I receive from any human court. In fact, I don&apos;t even assume to be my own judge,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">even though my conscience is clear. But that doesn&apos;t mean I stand acquitted before the Lord,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">for the only judge I care about is him!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">So resist the temptation to pronounce premature judgment on anything before the appointed time</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">when all will be fully revealed</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">. Instead, wait until the Lord makes his appearance, for he will bring all that is hidden in darkness to light</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">and unveil every secret motive of everyone&apos;s heart. Then,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">when the whole truth is known</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">, each will receive praise from God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Dear brothers and sisters, I&apos;ve been referring allusively to myself and Apollos in order to illustrate what I&apos;ve been saying. It is futile to move beyond what is written in the Scriptures and be inflated with self-importance by following and promoting one leader in competition with another.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">For what makes a distinction between you and someone else?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">And what do you have that grace has not given you?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">And if you received it</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">as a gift</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">, why do you boast as though there is something special about you?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Oh, I know, you already have all you need!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Since when did you become so content and rich without us? You&apos;ve already crowned yourselves as royalty, reigning on your thrones, leaving us</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">lowly apostles</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">far behind!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">How I wish indeed that you really were reigning as kings already, for that would mean we would be reigning as kings alongside of you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">It seems to me that God has appointed us apostles to be at the end of the line. We are like those on display at the end of the procession, as doomed gladiators soon to be killed. We have become a theatrical spectacle to all creation, both to people and to angels.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">We are fools for Christ, but you are wise in Christ! We are the frail; you are the powerful. You are celebrated;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">we are humiliated.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">If you could see us now, you&apos;d find that we are hungry and thirsty, poorly clothed,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">brutally treated,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">and with no roof over our heads.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">We work hard, toiling with our own hands. When people abuse and insult us, we respond with a blessing, and when severely persecuted, we endure it with patience.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">When we are slandered incessantly, we always answer gently,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">ready to reconcile. Even now, in the world&apos;s opinion, we are nothing but filth</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">and the lowest scum.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">I&apos;m not writing this to embarrass you or to shame you, but to correct you as the children I love.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">For although you could have countless babysitters</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">in Christ</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">telling you what you&apos;re doing wrong</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">, you don&apos;t have many fathers</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">who correct you in love</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">. But I&apos;m a true father to you, for I became your father when I gave you the gospel and brought you into union with Jesus, the Anointed One.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">So I encourage you, my children, to follow the example that I live before you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">That&apos;s why I&apos;ve sent my dear son Timothy, whom I love. He is faithful to the Lord Yahweh</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">and will remind you of how I conduct myself as one who lives in union with Jesus, the Anointed One, and of the teachings that I bring to every church everywhere.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">There are some among you who have exalted themselves as if I were not coming back to you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">But I will come soon, if it pleases the Lord, and I will find out not only what these arrogant ones are saying, but also if they have power to back up their words!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">For the kingdom realm of God comes with power, not simply impressive words.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">So which would you prefer? Shall I come carrying the rod of authority to discipline or with an embrace in love with a gentle spirit?</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="5">
			<VERS vnumber="3">Even though I am physically far away from you, my spirit is present with you. And as one who is present with you, I have already evaluated and judged the perpetrator.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">So</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">call a meeting</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">, and when you gather together in the name of our Lord Jesus, and you know my spirit is present with you in the infinite power of our Lord Jesus,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">release this man over to Satan</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">for the destruction of his</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">rebellious</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">flesh, in hope that his spirit may be rescued and restored in the day of the Lord.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Boasting</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">over your tolerance of sin</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">is inappropriate. Don&apos;t you understand that even a small compromise with sin permeates the entire fellowship, just as a little leaven permeates a batch of dough?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">So remove every trace of your &apos;leaven&apos; of compromise with sin so that you might become new and pure again. For indeed, you are clean</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">because Christ, our Passover Lamb, has been sacrificed for us.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">So now we can celebrate our continual feast, not with the old &apos;leaven,&apos; the yeast of wickedness or bitterness, but we will feast on the freshly baked bread of innocence and holiness.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">I wrote you</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">in my previous letter</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">asking you not to associate with those who practice sexual immorality.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Yet in no way was I referring to avoiding contact with unbelievers who are immoral, or greedy, or swindlers, or those who worship other gods&apos;for that would mean you&apos;d have to isolate yourself from the world entirely!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">But now I&apos;m writing to you so that you would exclude from your fellowship anyone who calls himself a fellow believer and practices sexual immorality, or is consumed with greed, or is an idolater, or is verbally abusive or a drunkard or a swindler. Don&apos;t mingle with them or even have a meal with someone like that.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="6">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Furthermore, how dare you take a fellow believer to court! It is wrong to drag him before the unrighteous to settle a legal dispute. Isn&apos;t it better to take him before God&apos;s holy believers to settle the matter?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Don&apos;t you realize that we, the holy ones, will judge the universe?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">If the unbelieving world is under your jurisdiction, you should be fully competent to settle these trivial lawsuits among yourselves.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">For surely you know that we will one day judge</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">angels, let alone these everyday matters.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Don&apos;t you realize that you are bringing your issues before civil judges appointed by people who have no standing within the church?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">What a shame that there is not one within the church</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">who has</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">the spirit of</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">wisdom who could arbitrate these disputes and reconcile the offended parties!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">It&apos;s not right for</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">a believer to sue a fellow believer&apos;and especially to bring it before the unbelievers.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Don&apos;t you realize that when you drag another believer into court you&apos;re providing the evidence that you are already defeated? Wouldn&apos;t it be better to accept the fact that someone is trying to cheat and take advantage of you, and simply</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">choose the high road</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">At times it is better to</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">just accept injustice and even to let someone take advantage of you,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">rather than to expose our conflicts publicly before unbelievers</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">But instead you keep cheating and doing wrong to your brothers and sisters,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">and then request that unbelievers render their judgment</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Surely you must know that people who practice evil cannot possess God&apos;s kingdom realm. Stop being deceived!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">People who continue to engage in sexual immorality, idolatry, adultery, sexual perversion,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">homosexuality,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">fraud, greed, drunkenness, verbal abuse,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">or extortion&apos;these will not inherit God&apos;s kingdom realm.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">It&apos;s true that some of you once lived in those lifestyles, but now you have been purified from sin,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">made holy, and given a perfect standing before God&apos;all because of the power of the name of the Lord Jesus, the Messiah, and through our union with the Spirit of our God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">It&apos;s true that our freedom allows us to do anything, but that doesn&apos;t mean that everything we do is good for us. I&apos;m free to do as I choose, but I choose to never be enslaved to anything.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Some have said, &apos;I eat to live and I live to eat!&apos; But God will do away with it all. The body was not created for illicit sex, but to serve and worship our Lord Jesus, who can fill the body with himself.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Now the God who raised up our Lord from the grave will awaken and raise us up through his mighty power!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Don&apos;t you know that your bodies belong to Christ as his body parts? Should one presume to take the members of Christ&apos;s body and make them into members of a harlot? Absolutely not!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Aren&apos;t you aware of the fact that when anyone sleeps with a prostitute he becomes a part of her, and she becomes a part of him? For it has been declared: The two become a single body.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">But the one who joins</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">himself to the Lord is mingled into one spirit with him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">This is why</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">you must keep running away from sexual immorality.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">For every other sin a person commits is external to the body, but immorality involves sinning against your own body.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Have you forgotten that your body is now the sacred temple of the Spirit of Holiness, who lives in you? You don&apos;t belong to yourself any longer, for the gift of God, the Holy Spirit, lives inside your sanctuary.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">You were God&apos;s expensive purchase, paid for with tears of blood,</VERS>

		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="7">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Now for my response concerning the issues you&apos;ve asked me to address.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">You wrote saying</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">, &apos;It is proper for a man to live in celibacy.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Perhaps. But because of the danger of immorality,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">each husband should have sexual intimacy with his wife and each wife should have sexual intimacy with her husband.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">A husband has the responsibility of meeting the sexual needs of his wife, and likewise a wife to her husband.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Neither the husband nor the wife have exclusive rights to their own bodies, but those rights are to be surrendered to the other.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">So don&apos;t continue to refuse your spouse those rights, except perhaps by mutual agreement for a specified time so that you can both be devoted to prayer.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">And then you should resume your physical pleasure so that the Adversary cannot take advantage of you because of the desires of your body.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">I&apos;m not giving you a divine command, but my godly advice.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">I would wish that all of you could live</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">unmarried</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">, just as I do.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Yet I understand that we are all decidedly different, with each having a special grace for one thing or another.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">So let me say to the unmarried and those who have lost their spouses, it is fine for you to remain single as I am.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">But if you have no power over your passions, then you should go ahead and marry, for marriage is far better than a continual battle with lust.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">And to those who are married, I give this charge&apos;which is not mine, but the Lord&apos;s</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">&apos;that the wife should not depart from her husband.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">But if she does, then she should either remain unmarried or reconcile with her husband. And a husband must not divorce his wife.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">To the rest I say, which is not a saying of the Lord, if a brother has an unbelieving wife and she is content to live with him, he should not divorce her.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">And if a woman has a husband who is not a believer and he is content to live with her, she should not divorce him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">For the unbelieving husband has been made holy by his believing wife. And the unbelieving wife has been made holy by her believing husband</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">by virtue of his or her sacred union to a believer</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Otherwise, the children from this union would be unclean, but in fact, they are holy.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">But if the unbelieving spouse wants a divorce, then let it be so. In this situation the believing spouse is not bound</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">to the marriage</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">, for God has called us to live in peace.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">And wives, for all you know you could one day lead your husband to salvation. Or husbands, how do you know for sure that you could not one day lead your wife to salvation?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">May all believers continue to live the wonderful lives God has called them to live, according to what he assigns for each person, for this is what I teach to believers</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">everywhere.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">If when you were called</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">to follow Jesus</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">you were circumcised, it would be futile to try to undo the circumcision. And if you were called while yet uncircumcised, there is no need to be circumcised.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Your identity</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">before God</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">has nothing to do with circumcision or uncircumcision.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">What really matters is following God&apos;s commandments.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">So everyone should continue to live</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">faithful</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">in the situation of life in which they were called</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">to follow Jesus</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Were you a slave when you heard the call</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">to follow Jesus</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">? Don&apos;t let that concern you. Even if you can gain your freedom, make the most of the opportunity.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">For truly, if you are called to a life-union with the Lord, you are already a free man! And those who were called to follow Jesus when they were free are now the Messiah&apos;s slaves.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">Since a great price was paid for your redemption, stop having the mind-set of a slave.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">Brothers and sisters, we must remain in close communion with God, no matter what our situation was when we were first called to follow Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">Now let me address the issue of singleness.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">I must confess, I have no command to give you that comes directly from the Lord. But let me share my thoughts on the matter, as coming from one who has experienced the mercy</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">of the Lord to keep me faithful to him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">Because of the severe pressure we are in,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">I recommend you remain as you are.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">If you are married, stay in the marriage. If you are single,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">don&apos;t rush into marriage.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">But if you do get married, you haven&apos;t sinned.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">It&apos;s just that I would want to spare you the problems you&apos;ll face with the extra challenges of being married.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">My friends, what I mean is this. The urgency of our times mean that from now on, those who have wives should live as though without them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">And those who weep should forget their tears. And those who rejoice will have no time to celebrate. And those who purchase items will have no time to enjoy them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">We are to live as those who live in the world but are not absorbed by it, for the world as we know it is quickly passing away.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">Because of this, we need to live as free from anxiety as possible. For a single man is focused on the things of the Lord and how he may please him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">But a married man is pulled in two directions, for he is concerned about both the things of God and the things of the world in order to please</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">his wife.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">And the single woman is focused on the things of the Lord so she can be holy both in body and spirit. But a married woman is concerned about the things of the world and how she may please her husband.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">I am trying to help you and make things easier for you and not make things difficult, but so that you would have undistracted devotion, serving the Lord constantly with an undivided heart.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">However, if a man has decided to serve God as a single person, yet changes his mind and finds himself in love with a woman, although he never intended to marry, let him go ahead and marry her; it is not a sin to do so.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">On the other hand, if a man stands firm in his heart to remain single, and is under no compulsion to get married but has control over his passions and is determined to remain celibate, he has chosen well.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">So then, the one who marries his fianc&apos;e does well and the one who chooses not to marry her does better.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">A wife is bound</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">by the marriage covenant</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">as long as her husband is living. But if the husband dies, she is free to marry again as she desires&apos;but, of course, he should be a believer in the Lord.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">However, in my opinion (and I think that I too have the Spirit of God), she would be happier if she remained single.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="8">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Now let me address the issue of food offered in sacrifice to idols. It seems that everyone believes his own opinion is right on this matter.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">How easily we get puffed up over our opinions! But love builds up the structure</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">of our new life</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">If anyone thinks of himself as a know-it-all, he still has a lot to learn.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">But if a person passionately loves God, he will possess the knowledge of God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Concerning food sacrificed as offerings to idols, we all know that an idol is nothing, for there is no God but one.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Although there may be many so-called gods in this world, and in heaven there may be many &apos;gods,&apos; &apos;lords,&apos; and &apos;masters,&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">yet for us there is only one God&apos;the Father. Out of him is all things, and our lives are lived for him. And there is one Lord, Jesus, the Anointed One, through whom we and all things exist.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">But not everyone has this revelation. For some were formerly idolaters, who consider idols as real and living. That&apos;s why they consider the food offered to that &apos;god&apos; as defiled. And their weak consciences become defiled if they eat it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Yes, we know that what you eat will not bring you closer to God. You are no better if you don&apos;t eat certain foods and no better if you do.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">But you must be careful that the liberty you exercise in eating food offered to idols doesn&apos;t offend the weak believers.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">For if a believer with a weak conscience sees you, who have a greater understanding, dining in an idol&apos;s temple, won&apos;t this be a temptation to him to violate his own conscience</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">and eat food offered to idols?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">So, in effect, by exercising your understanding of freedom, you have ruined this weak believer,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">a brother for whom Christ has died!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">And when you offend weaker believers by wounding their consciences in this way, you also offend</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">the Anointed One!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">So I conclude that if my eating certain food deeply offends</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">my brother and hinders his advance in Christ, I will never eat it again. I don&apos;t want to be guilty of causing my brother or sister to be wounded and defeated.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="9">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Am I not completely free and unrestrained?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">Absolutely!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">Am I not an apostle?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">Of course!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">Haven&apos;t I had a personal encounter with our Jesus face-to-face&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">and continue to see him</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">Emphatically yes!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">Aren&apos;t you all the proof of my ministry in the Lord?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">Certainly!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">If others do not recognize me as their apostle, at least you are bound to do so, for now your lives are joined to the Lord. You are the</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">living proof</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">, the certificate of my apostleship.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">So to those who want to continually criticize my apostolic ministry, here&apos;s my statement of defense.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Don&apos;t we apostles have the right to be supported financially?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Don&apos;t we have the right to travel accompanied by our believing wives</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">and be supported as a couple</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">, as do the other apostles, such as Peter the Rock and the Lord&apos;s brothers?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Of course we do!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Or is it only Barnabas and I who have no right to stop working for a living?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Who serves in the military at his own expense? Who plants a vineyard and does not enjoy the grapes for himself? Who would nurture and shepherd a flock and never get to drink its fresh milk?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Am I merely giving you my own opinions, or does the Torah teach the same things?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">For it is written in the law of Moses: You should never put a muzzle over the mouth of an ox while he is treading out the grain. Tell me, is God only talking about oxen here?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Doesn&apos;t he also give us this principle so that we won&apos;t withhold support from his workers?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">It was written so that we would understand that the one</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">spiritually</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">&apos;plowing&apos; and</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">spiritually</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">&apos;treading out the grain&apos; also labors with the expectation of enjoying the harvest.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">So, if we&apos;ve sowed many spiritual gifts</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">among you, is it too much to expect to reap material gifts from you?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">And if you have supported others, don&apos;t we rightfully deserve this privilege even more? But as you know, we haven&apos;t used that right. Instead, we have continued to support ourselves so that we would never be a hindrance to the spread of the gospel of Christ.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Don&apos;t you know that the priests</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">employed in sacred duty in the temple</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">are provided for by temple resources? And the priests who serve at the altar receive a portion of the offerings?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">In the same way, the Lord has directed those who proclaim the gospel to receive their living by the gospel. As for me, I&apos;ve preferred to never use any of these rights for myself.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">And keep in mind that I&apos;m not writing all this because I&apos;m hinting that you should support me. Actually, I&apos;d rather die than to have anyone rob me of this joyous reason for boasting!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">For you see, even though I proclaim the good news, I can&apos;t take the credit for my labors, for I am compelled to fulfill my duty by completing this work. It would be agony to me if I did not constantly preach the gospel!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">If it were my own idea to preach as a way to make a living, I would expect to be paid. Since it&apos;s not my idea but God&apos;s, who commissioned me, I am entrusted with the stewardship of the gospel</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">whether or not I&apos;m paid</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">So then, where is my reward? It is found in continually depositing the good news</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">into people&apos;s hearts</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">, without obligation, free of charge, and not insisting on my rights to be financially supported.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Now, even though I am free from obligations to others,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">I</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">joyfully</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">make myself a servant to all in order to win as many converts as possible.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">I became Jewish to the Jewish people in order to win them</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">to the Messiah</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">. I became like one under the law to gain the people who were stuck under the law, even though I myself am not under the law.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">And to those who are without the Jewish laws, I became like them, as one without the Jewish laws, in order to win them, although I&apos;m not outside the law of God but under the law of Christ.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">I became &apos;weak&apos; to the weak to win the weak. I have adapted to the culture of every place I&apos;ve gone</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">so that I could more easily win people to Christ.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">I&apos;ve done all this so that I would become God&apos;s partner for the sake of the gospel.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">Isn&apos;t it obvious that all runners on the racetrack</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">keep on running to win, but only one receives the victor&apos;s prize? Yet each one of you must run the race to be victorious.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">A true athlete will be disciplined in every respect, practicing constant self-control in order to win a laurel wreath that quickly withers. But we run our race to win a victor&apos;s crown that will last forever.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">For that reason, I don&apos;t run just for exercise</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">or box like one throwing aimless punches,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">but I train like a champion athlete. I subdue my body</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">and get it under my control, so that after preaching the good news to others I myself won&apos;t be disqualified.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="10">
			<VERS vnumber="1">My dear fellow believers, you need to understand that all of our Jewish ancestors</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">who walked through a wilderness long ago</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">were under the glory cloud</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">and passed through the waters of the sea on both sides.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">They were all baptized</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">into the cloud of glory, into the fellowship of Moses, and into the sea.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">They all ate the same heavenly manna</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">and drank water from the same spiritual rock</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">that traveled with them&apos;and that Rock</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">was Christ himself.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Yet God was not pleased with most of them, and their dead bodies were scattered around the wilderness.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Now, all these things serve as types and pictures for us&apos;lessons that teach us not to fail in the same way by callously craving worthless things</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">and practicing idolatry, as some of them did. For it is written: The people settled in to their unrestrained revelry, with feasting and drinking, then they rose up and became wildly out of control!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Neither should we commit sexual immorality, as some of them did, which caused the death of twenty-three thousand</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">on a single day.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Nor should we ever provoke the Lord,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">as some of them did by putting him to outrageous tests that resulted in their death from snakebites day after day.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">And we must not embrace their ways by complaining&apos;grumbling with discontent, as many of them did,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">and were killed by the destroyer!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">All the tests they endured on their way through the wilderness are a symbolic picture, an example that provides us with a warning so that we can learn through what they experienced. For we live in a time when the purpose of all the ages past is now completing its goal within us.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">So beware if you think it could never happen to you, lest your pride becomes your downfall.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">We all experience</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">times of testing,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">which is normal for every human being. But God will be faithful to you. He will screen and filter the severity, nature, and timing of every test or trial you face</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">so that you can bear it. And each test is an opportunity to trust him more, for along with every trial God has provided for you a way of escape</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">that will bring you out of it victoriously.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">My cherished friends, keep on running far away from idolatry.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">I know I am writing to thoughtful people, so carefully consider what I say.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">For when we pray for the blessing of the communion cup, isn&apos;t this our co-participation with the blood of Jesus?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">And the bread that we distribute, isn&apos;t this the bread of our co-participation with the body of Christ?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">For although we&apos;re many, we become one loaf of bread and one body as we feast together</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">on one loaf.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Consider the people of Israel</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">when they fell into idolatry</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">. When they ate the sacrifices offered to the gods, weren&apos;t they becoming communal participants in what was sacrificed?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Now, am I saying that idols and the sacrifices offered to them have any value?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Absolutely not! However, I am implying that when an unbeliever offers a sacrifice to an idol, it is not offered to the true God but to a demon. I don&apos;t want you to be participants with demons!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">You can&apos;t drink from the cup of the Lord and the cup of demons. You can&apos;t feast at the table of the Lord and feast</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">at the table of demons.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Who would ever want to arouse the Lord&apos;s jealousy? Is that something you think you&apos;re strong enough to endure?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">You say</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">, &apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">Under grace</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">there are no rules and we&apos;re free to do anything we please.&apos; Not exactly. Because not everything promotes growth in others. Your slogan, &apos;We&apos;re allowed to do anything we choose,&apos; may be true&apos;but not everything causes the spiritual advancement of others.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">So don&apos;t always seek what is best for you at the expense of another.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">Yes, you are free to eat anything without worrying about your conscience,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">for the earth and all its abundance belongs to the Lord.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">So if an unbeliever invites you to dinner, go ahead and eat whatever is served, without asking questions concerning where it came from.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">But if he goes out of his way to inform you that the meat was actually an offering sacrificed to idols, then you should pass, not only for his sake but because of his conscience.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">I&apos;m talking about someone else&apos;s conscience, not yours. What good is there in doing what you please if it&apos;s condemned by someone else?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">So if I voluntarily participate, why should I be judged for celebrating my freedom?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">Whether you eat or drink, live your life in a way that glorifies and honors God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">And make sure you&apos;re not offending Jews or Greeks or any part of God&apos;s assembly</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">over your personal preferences</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">Follow my example</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">, for I try to please everyone in all things, rather than putting my liberty first. I sincerely attempt to do anything I can so that others may be saved.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="11">
			<VERS vnumber="1">I want you to pattern your lives after me, just as I pattern mine after Christ.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">And I give you full credit for always keeping me in mind as you follow carefully the substance of my instructions</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">that I&apos;ve taught you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">But I want you to understand that Christ is the head</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">of every person, and Adam was the head of Eve,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">and God is the head of the Messiah.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Any man</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">who leads public worship</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">and prays or prophesies with a shawl hanging down over his head, shows disrespect to his head,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">which is Christ</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">And if any woman</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">in a place of leadership</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">within the church prays or prophesies</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">in public</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">with her long hair disheveled,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">she shows disrespect to her head,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">which is her husband</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">, for this would be the same as having her head shaved.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">If a woman who wants to be in leadership will not conform to the customs of what is proper for women,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">she might as well cut off her hair. But if it&apos;s disgraceful for her to have her hair cut off</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">or her head shaved, let her cover her head.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">A man</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">in leadership</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">is under no obligation to have his head covered</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">in the public gatherings</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">, because he is the portrait of God and reflects his glory. The woman, on the other hand, reflects the glory of her husband,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">for man was not created from woman but woman from man.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">By the same token, the man was not created because the woman needed him; the woman was created because the man needed her.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">For this reason she should have authority over the head because of the angels.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">So then, I have to insist that in the Lord, neither is woman inferior to man nor is man inferior to woman.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">For just as woman was taken from the side of man, in the same way man is taken from the</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">womb of</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">woman. God, as the source of all things,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">designed it this way</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">So then you can decide for yourselves&apos;is it proper for a woman to pray to God with her hair unbound?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Doesn&apos;t our long-established cultural tradition teach us that if a man has long hair that is</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">ornamentally arranged</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">it invites disgrace, but if a woman has long hair that is</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">ornamentally arranged</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">it is her glory?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">This is because long hair is the endowment that God has given her as a head covering.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">If someone wants to quarrel about this, I want you to know that we have no intention</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">to start an argument, neither I nor the congregations of God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Now, on this next matter, I wish I could commend you, but I cannot, because when you meet together as a church family it is doing more harm than good!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">I&apos;ve been told many times that when you meet as a congregation, divisions and cliques emerge&apos;and to some extent, this doesn&apos;t surprise me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Differences of opinion are unavoidable, yet they will reveal which ones among you truly have God&apos;s approval.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">When all of</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">your house churches</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">gather as one church family, you are not really properly celebrating the Lord&apos;s Supper.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">For when it comes time to eat, some gobble down their food before anything is given to others&apos;one is left hungry while others become drunk!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Don&apos;t you all have homes where you can eat and drink? Don&apos;t you realize that you&apos;re showing a superior attitude by humiliating those who have nothing? Are you trying to show contempt for God&apos;s beloved church? How should I address this appropriately? If you&apos;re looking for my approval, you won&apos;t find it!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">I have handed down to you what came to me by direct revelation from the Lord himself. The same night in which he was handed over,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">he took bread</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">and gave thanks. Then he distributed it to the disciples and said,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">&apos;Take it and eat your fill.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">It is my body, which is given for you. Do this to remember me.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">He did the same with the cup</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">of wine</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">after supper and said,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">&apos;This cup seals the new covenant with my blood. Drink it&apos;and whenever you drink this, do it to remember me.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">Whenever you eat this bread and drink this cup, you are retelling the story, proclaiming our Lord&apos;s death until he comes.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">For this reason, whoever eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in the wrong spirit will be guilty of dishonoring the body and blood of the Lord.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">So let each individual first evaluate his own attitude and only then eat the bread and drink the cup.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">For continually eating and drinking with a wrong spirit</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">will bring judgment upon yourself by not recognizing the body.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">This insensitivity is why many of you are weak, chronically ill, and some even dying.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">If we have examined ourselves, we should not be judged.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">But when we are judged, it is the Lord&apos;s training so that we will not be condemned along with the world.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">So then, my fellow believers, when you assemble as one to share a meal, show respect for one another and wait for all to be served.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">If you are that hungry, eat at home first, so that when you gather together you will not bring judgment upon yourself. When I come to you, I will answer the other questions you asked me in your letter .</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1">My fellow believers, I don&apos;t want you to be confused about spiritual realities.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">For you know full well that when you were unbelievers you were often led astray</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">in one way or another by your worship of idols, which are incapable of talking with you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Therefore, I want to impart to you an understanding of the following: No one speaking by the Spirit of God would ever say, &apos;Jesus is the accursed one.&apos; No one can say, &apos;Jesus is the Lord Yahweh,&apos; unless the Holy Spirit is speaking through him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">It is the same Holy Spirit who continues to distribute many different varieties of gifts.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">The Lord Yahweh is one,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">and he is the one who apportions to believers different varieties of ministries.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">The same God distributes different kinds of miracles</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">that accomplish different results through each believer&apos;s gift and ministry as he energizes and activates them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Each believer is given continuous revelation</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">by the Holy Spirit to benefit not just himself but all.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">For example: The Spirit gives to one the gift of the word of wisdom. To another, the same Spirit gives the gift of the word of revelation knowledge.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">And to another, the same Spirit gives the gift of faith. And to another, the same Spirit gives gifts of healing.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">And to another the power to work miracles. And to another the gift of prophecy. And to another the gift to discern what the Spirit is speaking. And to another the gift of speaking different kinds of tongues. And to another the gift of interpretation of tongues.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Remember, it is the same Holy Spirit who distributes, activates, and operates these different gifts as he chooses for each believer.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Just as the human body is one, though it has many parts that together form one body, so too is Christ.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">For by one Spirit we all were immersed and mingled into one single body.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">And no matter our status&apos;whether we are Jews or non-Jews, oppressed or free&apos;we are all privileged to drink deeply of the same Holy Spirit.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">In fact, the human body is not one single part but rather many parts</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">mingled into one</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">So if the foot were to say, &apos;Since I&apos;m not a hand, I&apos;m not a part of the body,&apos; it&apos;s forgetting that it is still a vital part of the body.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">And if the ear were to say, &apos;Since I&apos;m not an eye, I&apos;m not really a part of the body,&apos; it&apos;s forgetting that it is still an important part of the body.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Think of it this way</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">. If the whole body were just an eyeball, how could it hear sounds? And if the whole body were just an ear, how could it smell different fragrances?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">But God has carefully designed each member and placed it in the body to function as he desires.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">A diversity is required</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">, for if the body consisted of one single part, there wouldn&apos;t be a body at all!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">So now we see that there are many differing parts and functions, but one body.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">It would be wrong for the eye to say to the hand, &apos;I don&apos;t need you,&apos; and equally wrong if the head said to the foot, &apos;I don&apos;t need you.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">In fact, the weaker our parts, the more vital and essential they are.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">The body parts we think are less honorable we treat with greater respect. And the body parts that need to be covered in public we treat with propriety and clothe them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">But some of our body parts don&apos;t require as much attention. Instead, God has mingled the body parts together, giving greater honor to the &apos;lesser&apos; members who lacked it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">He has done this intentionally</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">so that every member would look after the others with mutual concern, and so that there will be no division in the body.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">In that way, whatever happens to one member happens to all. If one suffers, everyone suffers. If one is honored, everyone rejoices.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">You are the body of the Anointed One, and each of you is a unique and vital part of it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">God has placed in the church the following: First apostles, second prophets, third teachers, then those with gifts of miracles, gifts of divine healing, gifts of revelation knowledge, gifts of leadership, and gifts of different kinds of tongues.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">Not everyone is an apostle or a prophet or a teacher. Not everyone performs miracles</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">or has gifts of healing or speaks in tongues or interprets tongues.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">But you should all constantly boil over with passion in seeking the higher gifts. And now I will show you a superior way to live that is beyond comparison!</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="7">Love never takes failure as defeat, for it never gives up.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Love never stops loving.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">It extends beyond the gift of prophecy, which eventually fades away.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">It is more enduring than tongues, which will one day fall silent. Love remains long after</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">words of</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">knowledge are forgotten.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Our present knowledge and our prophecies are but partial,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">but when love&apos;s perfection arrives, the partial will fade away.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">When I was a child, I spoke about childish matters, for I saw things like a child and reasoned like a child. But the day came when I matured, and I set aside my childish ways.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">For now we see but a faint reflection of riddles and mysteries</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="14">
			<VERS vnumber="1">It is good that you are enthusiastic and passionate about spiritual gifts, especially prophecy.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">When someone speaks in tongues, no one understands a word he says, because he&apos;s not speaking to people, but to God&apos;he is speaking intimate mysteries in the Spirit.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">But when someone prophesies, he speaks to encourage people, to build them up, and to bring them comfort.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">The one who speaks in tongues advances his own spiritual progress,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">while the one who prophesies builds up the church.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">I would be delighted if you all spoke in tongues, but I desire even more that you impart prophetic revelation to others. Greater gain comes through the one who prophesies than the one who speaks in tongues, unless there is interpretation so that it builds up the entire church.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">My dear friends, what good is it if I come to you always speaking in tongues? But if I come with a clear revelation from God, or with insight,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">or with a prophecy, or with a clear teaching,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">I can enrich you</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Similarly, if musical instruments, such as flutes or stringed instruments, are out of tune and don&apos;t play the arrangement clearly, how will anyone recognize the melody?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">If the bugle makes a garbled sound, who will recognize the signal to show up for the battle?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">So it is with you. Unless you speak in a language that&apos;s easily understood, how will anyone know what you&apos;re talking about? You might as well save your breath!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">I suppose that the world has all sorts of languages, and each conveys meaning to the ones who speak it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">But I am like a foreigner if I don&apos;t understand the language, and the speaker will be like a foreigner to me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">And that&apos;s what&apos;s happening among you. You are so passionate</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">about embracing the manifestations of the Holy Spirit! Now become even more passionate about the things that strengthen the entire church.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">So then, if you speak in a tongue, pray for the interpretation to be able to unfold the meaning of what you are saying.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">For if I am praying in a tongue, my spirit is engaged in prayer but I have no clear understanding of what is being said.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">So here&apos;s what I&apos;ve concluded. I will pray in the Spirit, but I will also pray with my mind engaged. I will sing rapturous praises in the Spirit, but I will also sing with my mind engaged.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Otherwise, if you are praising God in your spirit, how could someone without the gift participate by adding his &apos;amen&apos; to your giving of thanks, since he doesn&apos;t have a clue of what you&apos;re saying?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Your praise to God is admirable, but it does nothing to strengthen and build up others.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">I give thanks to God that I speak in tongues more than all of you,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">but in the church setting I would rather speak five words that can be understood than ten thousand exotic words in a tongue. That way I could have a role in teaching others.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Beloved ones,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">don&apos;t remain as immature children in your reasoning. As it relates to evil, be like newborns, but in your thinking be mature adults.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">For it stands written in the law: I will bring my message to this people with strange tongues and foreign lips, yet even then they still will not listen to me, says the Lord.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">So then, tongues are not a sign for believers, but a miracle for unbelievers. Prophecy, on the other hand, is not for unbelievers, but a miracle sign for believers.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">If the entire church comes together and everyone is speaking in tongues, won&apos;t the visitors say that you have lost your minds?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">But if everyone is prophesying, and an unbeliever or one without the gift enters your meeting, he will be convicted by all that he hears and will be called to account,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">for the intimate secrets of his heart will be brought to light. He will be mystified and fall facedown in worship and say, &apos;God is truly among you!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">Beloved friends,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">what does all this imply? When you conduct your meetings, you should always let everything be done to build up the church family. Whether you share a song of praise,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">a teaching, a divine revelation, or a tongue and interpretation, let each one contribute what strengthens others.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">If someone speaks in a tongue, it should be two or three,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">one after another, with someone interpreting.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">If there&apos;s no one with the interpretation, then he should remain silent in the meeting, content to speak to himself and to God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">And the same with prophecy</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">. Let two or three prophets prophesy and let the other prophets carefully evaluate and discern what is being said.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">But if someone receives a revelation while someone else is still speaking, the one speaking should conclude</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">and allow the one with fresh revelation the opportunity to share it</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">For you can all prophesy in turn and in an environment where all present can be instructed, encouraged, and strengthened.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">The spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">For God is the God of harmony, not confusion,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">as is the pattern in all the churches of God&apos;s holy believers.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">The women</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">should be respectfully silent</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">during the evaluation of prophecy in the meetings</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">They are not allowed to interrupt,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">but are to be in a support role, as in fact the law teaches.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">If they want to inquire about something, let them ask their husbands when they get home, for a woman embarrasses herself when she constantly interrupts the church meeting.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">Do you actually think that you were the starting point for the Word of God going forth? Were you the only ones it was sent to?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">I don&apos;t think so!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">If anyone considers himself to be a prophet or a spiritual person,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">let him discern that what I&apos;m writing to you carries the Lord&apos;s authority.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">And if anyone continues not to recognize this, he should not be recognized!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">So, beloved friends,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">with all this in mind, be passionate</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">to prophesy and don&apos;t forbid anyone from speaking in tongues,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">doing all things in a beautiful</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">and orderly way.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="15">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Dear friends,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">let me give you clearly the heart of the gospel that I&apos;ve preached to you&apos;the good news that you have heartily received and on which you stand.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">For it is through the revelation of the gospel that you are being saved, if you fasten your life firmly to the message I&apos;ve taught you, unless you have believed in vain.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">For I have shared with you what I have received and what is of utmost importance: The Messiah died for our sins, fulfilling the prophecies of the Scriptures.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">He was buried in a tomb and was raised from the dead after three days, as foretold in the Scriptures.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Then he appeared to Peter the Rock and to the twelve apostles.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">He also appeared to more than five hundred of his followers at the same time, most of whom are still alive as I write this, though a few have passed away.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Then he appeared to Jacob</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">and to all the apostles.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Last of all he appeared in front of me, like one born prematurely, ripped from the womb.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Yes, I am the most insignificant of all the apostles, unworthy even to be called an apostle, because I hunted down believers and persecuted God&apos;s church.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">But God&apos;s amazing grace has made me who I am!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">And his grace to me was not fruitless. In fact, I worked harder than all the rest,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">yet not in my own strength but God&apos;s, for his empowering grace is poured out upon me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">So this is what we all have taught you, and whether it was through me or someone else, you have now believed the gospel.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">The message we preach is Christ, who has been raised from the dead. So how could any of you possibly say there is no resurrection of the dead?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">For if there is no such thing as a resurrection from the dead, then not even Christ has been raised.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">And if Christ has not been raised, all of our preaching has been for nothing and your faith is useless.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Moreover, if the dead are not raised, that would mean that we are false witnesses who are misrepresenting God. And that would mean that we have preached a lie, stating that God raised him from the dead, if in reality he didn&apos;t.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">If the dead aren&apos;t raised up,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">that would mean that Christ has not been raised up either.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">And if Christ is not alive, you are still lost in your sins and your faith is a fantasy.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">It would also mean that those believers in Christ who have passed away</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">have simply perished.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">If the only benefit of our hope in Christ is limited to this life on earth, we deserve to be pitied more than all others!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">But the truth is, Christ is risen from the dead, as the firstfruit</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">of a great resurrection harvest of those who have died.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">For since death came through a man,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Adam</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">it is fitting that the resurrection of the dead has also come through a man,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Christ</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Even as all who are in Adam die, so also all who are in Christ will be made alive.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">But each one in his proper order: Christ, the firstfruits, then those who belong to Christ in his presence.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">Then the final stage of completion comes, when he will bring to an end every other rulership, authority, and power, and he will hand over his kingdom to Father God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">Until then he is destined to reign</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">as King</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">until all hostility has been subdued and placed under his feet.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">And the last enemy to be subdued and eliminated is death itself.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">The Father has placed all things in subjection under the feet of Christ.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">Yet when it says, &apos;all things,&apos; it is understood that the Father does not include himself, for he is the one who placed all things in subjection to Christ.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">However, when everything is subdued and in submission to him, then the Son himself will be subject to the Father, who put all things under his feet.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">This is so that Father God will be everything in everyone!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">If there is no resurrection, what do these people think they&apos;re doing when they are baptized for the dead? If the dead aren&apos;t raised, why be baptized for them?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">And why would we be risking our lives every day?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">My brothers and sisters, I continually face death.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">This is as sure as my boasting of you</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">and our co-union together in the life of our Lord Jesus Christ, who gives me confidence to share my experiences with you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">Tell me, why did I fight &apos;wild beasts&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">in Ephesus if my hope is in this life only? What was the point of that? If the dead do not rise, then Let&apos;s party all night, for tomorrow we die!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">So stop fooling yourselves! Evil companions will corrupt good morals and character.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">Come back to your right senses and awaken to what is right. Repent from your sinful ways. For some have no knowledge of God&apos;s wonderful love.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">You should be ashamed that you make me write this way to you!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">I can almost hear someone saying, &apos;How can the dead come back to life? And what kind of body will they have when they are resurrected?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">Foolish man! Don&apos;t you know that what you sow in the ground doesn&apos;t germinate unless it dies?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">And what you sow is not the body that will come into being, but the bare seed. And it&apos;s hard to tell whether it&apos;s wheat or some other seed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">But when it dies, God gives it a new form, a body to fulfill his purpose, and he sees to it that each seed gets a new body of its own</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">and becomes the plant he designed it to be</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">All flesh is not identical. Animals have one flesh and human beings another. Birds have their distinct flesh and fish another.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">In the same way there are earthly bodies and heavenly bodies. There is a splendor of the celestial body and a different one for the earthly.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41">There is the radiance of the sun and differing radiance for the moon and for the stars. Even the stars differ in their shining.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42">And that&apos;s how it will be with the resurrection of the dead.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43">The body is &apos;sown&apos; in decay, but will be raised in immortality. It is &apos;sown&apos; in humiliation, but will be raised in glorification.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44">It is &apos;sown&apos; in weakness but will be raised in power. If there is a physical body, there is also a spiritual body.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45">For it is written: The first man, Adam, became a living soul. The last Adam became the life-giving Spirit.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46">However, the spiritual didn&apos;t come first. The natural precedes the spiritual.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="47">The first man was from the dust of the earth; the second Man is Yahweh,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="47">from the realm of heaven.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="48">The first one, made from dust, has a race of people just like him, who are also made from dust. The One sent from heaven has a race of heavenly people who are just like him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="49">Once we carried the likeness of the man of dust, but now let us</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="49">carry the likeness of the man of heaven.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="50">Now, I tell you this, my brothers and sisters, flesh and blood are not able to inherit God&apos;s kingdom realm, and neither will that which is decaying be able to inherit what is incorruptible.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="51">Listen, and I will tell you a divine mystery: not all of us will die, but we will all be transformed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="52">It will happen in an instant</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="52">&apos;in the twinkling of his eye. For when the last trumpet is sounded, the dead will come back to life. We will be indestructible and we will be transformed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="53">For we will discard our mortal &apos;clothes&apos; and slip into a body that is imperishable. What is mortal now will be exchanged for immortality.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="54">And when that which is mortal puts on immortality, and what now decays is exchanged for what will never decay, then the Scripture will be fulfilled that says: Death is swallowed up by a triumphant victory!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="55">So death, tell me, where is your victory? Tell me death, where is your sting?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="56">It is sin that gives death its sting and the law that gives sin its power.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="57">But we thank God</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1">Now, concerning the collection I want you to take for God&apos;s holy believers</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">in Jerusalem who are in need</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">I want you to follow the same instructions I gave the churches of Galatia.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Every Sunday, each of you make a generous offering by taking a portion of whatever God has blessed you with and place it in safekeeping. Then I won&apos;t have to make a special appeal when I come.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">When I arrive, I will send your gift to the poor in Jerusalem along with a letter of explanation, carried by those whom you approve.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">If it seems advisable for me to accompany them, I&apos;ll be glad to have them travel with me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">I plan to be traveling through Macedonia, and afterward I will visit you</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">and perhaps stay there for a while, or even spend the winter with you. Afterward you can send me on my journey, wherever I go next, with your financial support.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">For it&apos;s not my desire to just see you in passing, but I would like to spend some time with you if the Lord permits.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Regardless, I will remain in Ephesus until</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">the feast of</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Pentecost.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">There&apos;s an amazing door of opportunity standing wide open for me to minister here, even though there are many who oppose and stand against me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">When Timothy arrives, make sure that he feels at home while he&apos;s with you, for he&apos;s advancing the Lord&apos;s work just as I am.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Don&apos;t let anyone disparage or look down on him, but kindly help him on his way with financial support so that he may come back to me, for I am waiting for him and the brothers to return.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Now, about our brother Apollos. I&apos;ve tried hard to convince him to come visit you with the other brothers,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">but it&apos;s simply not the right time for him now. But</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">don&apos;t worry</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">, he&apos;ll come when he has the opportunity.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Remember to stay alert and hold firmly to all that you believe. Be mighty and full of courage.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Let love and kindness be the motivation behind all that you do.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Dear brothers and sisters, I have a request to make of you. Give special recognition to Stephanas and his family, for they were the first converts in Achaia,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">and they have fully devoted themselves to serve God&apos;s holy people.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">I urge you to honor and support them, and all those like them who work so diligently for the Lord.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">I was delighted when Stephanas,</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="17">and Achaicus</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">arrived, for they&apos;ve made up for your absence.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="19">All the churches of western Turkey</VERS>

	<BIBLEBOOK bnumber="47" bname="2  Corinthians">
		<CHAPTER cnumber="1">
			<VERS vnumber="1">From Paul to God&apos;s called ones, his church in Corinth. I have been chosen by Jesus Christ to be his apostle according to God&apos;s perfect plan. Our brother Timothy joins me in writing to you and all the holy believers throughout the Roman province of Achaia.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">May undeserved favor and endless peace be yours continually from our Father God and from our Lord Jesus, the Anointed One!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">All praises belong to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. For he is the Father of tender mercy and the God of endless comfort.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">He always comes alongside us to comfort us in every suffering so that we can come alongside those who are in any painful trial. We can bring them this same comfort that God has poured out upon us.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">And just as we experience the abundance of Christ&apos;s own sufferings,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">even more of God&apos;s comfort will cascade upon us through our union with Christ.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">If troubles weigh us down, that just means that we will receive even more comfort to pass on to you for your deliverance! For the comfort pouring into us empowers us to bring comfort to you. And with this comfort upholding you, you can endure</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">victoriously</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">the same suffering that we experience.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Now our hope for you is unshakable,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">because we know that just as you share in our sufferings you will also share in God&apos;s comforting strength.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Brothers and sisters, you need to know about the severe trials we experienced while we were in western Turkey.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">All of the hardships we passed through crushed us beyond our ability to endure, and we were so completely overwhelmed that we were about to give up entirely.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">It felt like we</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">had a death sentence written upon our hearts,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">and we still feel it to this day</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">. It has taught us to lose all faith in ourselves and to place all of our trust in the God who raises the dead.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">He has rescued us from terrifying encounters with death. And now we fasten our hopes on him to continue to deliver us from death yet again,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">as you labor together with us through prayer.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Because there are so many interceding for us</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">, our deliverance will cause even more people to give thanks to God. What a gracious gift of mercy surrounds us because of your prayers!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">We rejoice in saying with complete honesty and a clear conscience</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">that God has empowered us to conduct ourselves</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">in a holy manner and with no hidden agenda.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">God&apos;s marvelous grace enables us to minister to everyone with pure motives, not in the clever wisdom of the world. This is especially true in all of our dealings with you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">We write to you with words that are clearly understood, and there is no need for you to try to read between the lines of what we write in hopes that you can completely and accurately understand</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">our hearts</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">We know you have already understood us in a measure and that you will eventually come to understand us fully.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Then you&apos;ll be able to boast of us even as we will boast of you in the day of our Lord Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">When I revised my itinerary, was I vacillating? Or do I make my plans with unprincipled motives,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">ready to flip-flop with a &apos;yes&apos; and a &apos;no&apos; in the same breath?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Of course not!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">For as God is true to his word, my promise</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">to you was not a</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">fickle</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">&apos;yes&apos; when I meant &apos;no.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Jesus Christ is the Son of God, and he is the one whom Timothy, Silas, and I have preached to you&apos;and he has never been both a &apos;yes&apos; and a &apos;no.&apos; He has always been and always will be for us a resounding &apos;YES!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">For all of God&apos;s promises find their &apos;yes&apos; of fulfillment in him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">And as his &apos;yes&apos; and our &apos;amen&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">ascend to God, we bring him glory!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Now, it is God himself who has anointed us. And he is constantly strengthening both you and us in union with Christ.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">He knows we are his</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">since he has also stamped his seal of love</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">over our hearts and has given us the Holy Spirit like an engagement ring is given to a bride&apos;a down payment of the blessings to come!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">Now, I call upon this faithful God as a witness against me</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">if I&apos;m not telling you the absolute truth</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">. It was because I hold you in my heart that I decided not to return to Corinth, in order to spare you</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">the humiliation of my rebuke</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">But I don&apos;t want to imply that</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">as leaders</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">we coerce you or somehow want to rule over your faith.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">Instead, we are your partners who are called to increase your joy.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">And we know that you already stand firm because of your</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">strong</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">faith.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="2">
			<VERS vnumber="1">So</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">until these issues were settled</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">I decided against paying you another painful visit.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">For if I brought you pain, you would be unable to bring me joy.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">And this was the very point I made in my letter, for I didn&apos;t want to come and find sadness filling the very ones who should give me cheer. But I&apos;m confident</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">that you will do what&apos;s right</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">so that my joyous delight will be yours.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">I wrote you previously sobbing and with a broken heart.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">I was filled with anguish and deep distress. I had no intention of causing you pain but to convey the overwhelming measure of my love for you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">For the one who has caused me grief has not only grieved me but, to some extent, has caused you all grief as well.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">I believe that your united rebuke</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">has been punishment enough for him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Instead of more punishment, what he needs most is your encouragement through your gracious display of forgiveness.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">I beg you to reaffirm your deep love for him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">You see, I wrote previously in order to see if your hearts would pass the test and if you were willing to follow my counsel in everything.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">If you freely forgive anyone for anything, then I also forgive him. And if I have forgiven anything, I did so for you before the face of Christ,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">so that we would not be exploited</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">by the adversary, Satan, for we know his clever schemes.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">When I arrived at Troas, bringing the wonderful news of Christ, the Lord opened a great door of opportunity to minister there.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Still, I had no peace of mind, because I couldn&apos;t find my dear brother Titus</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">anywhere. So after saying goodbye to the believers, I set out for Macedonia to look for him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">God always makes his grace visible</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">in Christ, who includes us as partners of his endless triumph.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Through our yielded lives he spreads</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">the fragrance of the knowledge of God everywhere we go.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">We</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">have become the unmistakable aroma</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">of the victory</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">of the Anointed One to God</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">&apos;a perfume of life to those being saved and the odor of death</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">to those who are perishing.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">The unbelievers smell a deadly stench that leads to death, but believers smell the life-giving aroma that leads to abundant life. And who of us can rise to this challenge?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">For unlike so many, we are not peddlers</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">of God&apos;s Word who water down the message. We are those sent from God with pure motives, who speak in the sight of God</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">from our union with Christ.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="3">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Are we beginning to sound like those who speak highly of themselves? Do you really need letters of recommendation</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">to validate our ministry</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">, like others do?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">Do we really need your letter of endorsement?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">Of course not!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">For your very lives are our &apos;letters of recommendation,&apos; permanently engraved on our hearts, recognized and read by everybody.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">As a result of our ministry, you are living letters written by Christ, not with ink but by the Spirit of the living God&apos;not carved onto stone tablets</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">but on the tablets of tender hearts.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">We carry this confidence in our hearts because of our union with Christ before God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Yet we don&apos;t see ourselves as capable enough to do anything in our own strength, for our true competence flows from God&apos;s</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">empowering presence</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">He alone makes us adequate ministers who are focused on an entirely new covenant. Our ministry is not based on the letter of the law but through the</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">power of the</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Spirit. The letter of the law kills, but the Spirit pours out life.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Even the ministry that was characterized by chiseled letters on stone tablets came with a dazzling measure of glory,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">though it produced death. The Israelites couldn&apos;t bear to gaze on the glowing face of Moses</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">because of the radiant splendor shining from his countenance&apos;a glory destined to fade away.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Yet how much more radiant is this new and glorious ministry of the Spirit</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">that shines from us</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">For if the former ministry of condemnation was ushered in with a measure of glory, how much more does the ministry that imparts righteousness far excel in glory.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">What once was glorious no longer holds any glory because of the increasingly</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">greater glory that has replaced it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">The fading ministry came with a portion of glory, but now we embrace the unfading ministry of a permanent impartation of glory.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">So then, with this amazing hope living in us, we step out in freedom and boldness to speak the truth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">We are not like Moses, who used a veil to hide the glory to keep the Israelites from staring at him as it faded away.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Their minds were closed and hardened, for even to this day that same veil comes over their minds when they hear the words of the former covenant. The veil has not yet been lifted from them, for it is only eliminated when one is joined to the Messiah.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">So until now, whenever the Old Testament</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">is being read, the same blinding comes over their hearts.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">But the moment one turns to the Lord</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">with an open heart, the veil is lifted</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">and they see</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Now, the &apos;Lord&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">I&apos;m referring to</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">is the Holy Spirit,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">and wherever he is Lord, there is freedom.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">We can all draw close to him with the veil removed from our faces. And with no veil we all become like mirrors who brightly reflect the glory of the Lord</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Jesus</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">We are being transfigured</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">into his very image as we move from one brighter level of glory to another.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">And this glorious transfiguration comes from the Lord, who is the Spirit.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="4">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Now, it&apos;s because of God&apos;s mercy</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">that we have been entrusted with the privilege of this</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">new covenant</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">ministry. And we will not quit or faint with weariness.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">We reject every shameful cover-up and refuse to resort to cunning trickery or distorting the Word of God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Instead, we open up our souls to you</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">by presenting the truth to everyone&apos;s conscience in the sight and presence of God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Even if our gospel message is veiled, it is only veiled to those who are perishing,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">for their minds have been blinded by the god of this age,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">leaving them in unbelief. Their blindness keeps them from seeing the dayspring light</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">divine</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">image of God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">We don&apos;t preach ourselves, but rather the lordship of Jesus Christ, for we are your servants for Jesus&apos; sake.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">For God, who said, &apos;Let brilliant light shine out of darkness,&apos; is the one who has cascaded his light into us&apos;the brilliant dawning light of the glorious knowledge of God as we gaze into the face of Jesus Christ.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">We are like common clay jars that carry this glorious treasure within, so that this immeasurable power will be seen as God&apos;s, not ours.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Though we experience every kind of pressure, we&apos;re not crushed. At times we don&apos;t know what to do, but quitting is not an option.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">We are persecuted by others, but God has not forsaken us. We may be knocked down, but not out.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">We continually share in the death of Jesus in our own bodies</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">so that the resurrection life of Jesus will be revealed through our humanity.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">We consider living to mean that we are constantly being handed over to death for Jesus&apos; sake so that the life of Jesus will be revealed through our humanity.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">So, then, death is at work in us but it releases life in you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">We have the same Spirit of faith that is described in the Scriptures when it says, &apos;First I believed, then I spoke in faith.&apos; So we also first believe then speak in faith.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">We do this because we are convinced that he who raised Jesus will raise us up with him, and together we will all be brought into his presence.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Yes, all things work for your enrichment</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">so that more of God&apos;s marvelous grace will spread to more and more people, resulting in an even greater increase of praise</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">to God, bringing him even more glory!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">So no wonder we don&apos;t give up. For even though our outer person gradually wears out, our inner being is renewed every single day.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">We view our slight, short-lived troubles in the light of eternity. We see our difficulties as the substance that produces for us an eternal, weighty glory far beyond all comparison,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">because we don&apos;t focus our attention on what is seen but on what is unseen. For what is seen is temporary, but the unseen realm is eternal.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="5">
			<VERS vnumber="1">We are convinced that even if these bodies we live in are folded up at death like tents, we will still have a God-built home that no human hands have built, which will last forever in the heavenly realm.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">We inwardly sigh</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">as we live in these physical</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">tents</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">,&apos; longing to put on a new body for our life in heaven,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">in the belief that once we put on our new &apos;clothing&apos; we won&apos;t find ourselves &apos;naked.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">So, while living in this &apos;tent,&apos; we groan under its burden, not because we want to die but because we want these new bodies. We crave for all that is mortal to be swallowed up by</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">eternal</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">life.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">And this is no empty hope</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">, for God himself is the one who has prepared us for this wonderful destiny. And to confirm this promise, he has given us the Holy Spirit, like an engagement ring, as a guarantee.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">That&apos;s why we&apos;re always full of courage. Even while we&apos;re at home in the body, we&apos;re homesick to be with the Master&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">for we live by faith, not by what we see with our eyes.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">We live with a joyful confidence, yet at the same time we take delight in the thought of leaving our bodies behind to be at home with the Lord.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">So whether we live or die</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">we make it our life&apos;s passion</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">to live our lives pleasing to him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">For one day we will all be openly revealed before Christ on his throne</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">so that each of us will be duly recompensed for our actions done in life,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">whether good or worthless.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Since we are those who stand in holy awe of the Lord,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">we make it our passion to persuade others</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">to turn to him</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">. We know that our lives are transparent before the God who knows us fully, and I hope that we are also well known to your consciences.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Again, we are not taking an opportunity to brag,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">but giving you information</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">that will enable you to be proud of us, and to answer those who esteem outward appearances while overlooking what is in the heart.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">If we are out of our minds in a blissful, divine ecstasy,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">it is for God, but if we are in our right minds, it is for your benefit.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">For it is Christ&apos;s love that fuels our passion and holds us tightly,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">because we are convinced that he has given his life for all of us. This means all died with him,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">so that those who live</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">should no longer live self-absorbed lives but lives that are poured out for him&apos;the one who died for us and now lives again.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">So, from now on, we refuse to evaluate people merely by their outward appearances. For that&apos;s how we once viewed the Anointed One, but no longer do we see him with limited human insight.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Now, if anyone is enfolded into Christ, he has become an entirely new person. All that is related to the old order has vanished.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Behold, everything is fresh and new.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">And God has made all things new,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">and reconciled</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">us to himself, and given us the ministry of reconciling others to God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">In other words, it was through the Anointed One that God was shepherding the world,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">not even keeping records of their transgressions, and he has entrusted to us the ministry of opening the door of reconciliation to God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">We are ambassadors</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">of the Anointed One who carry the message of Christ to the world, as though God were tenderly pleading</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">with them directly through our lips. So we tenderly plead with you on Christ&apos;s behalf, &apos;Turn back to God and be reconciled to him.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">For God made</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">the only one who did not know sin to become sin for us,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">so that we might become the righteousness of God through our union with him.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="6">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Now, since we are God&apos;s coworkers, we beg you not to take God&apos;s marvelous grace for granted,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">allowing it to have no effect on your lives</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">For he says, I listened to you at the time of my favor. And the day when you needed salvation, I came to your aid. So can&apos;t you see? Now is the time to respond to his favor! Now is the day of salvation!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">We will not place obstacles</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">in anyone&apos;s way that hinder them</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">from coming to salvation</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">so that our ministry will not be discredited.</VERS>

		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="7">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Beloved ones, with promises like these, and because of our deepest respect and worship of God, we must remove everything from our lives</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">that contaminates body and spirit, and continue to complete the development of holiness within us.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Again, I urge you, make room for us in your hearts, for we have wronged</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">no one, corrupted</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">no one, and taken advantage</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">of no one.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">I&apos;m not saying this to condemn you, for I already told you that we carry you permanently in our hearts&apos;and you&apos;ll stay there throughout our lives, for we will live together and die together.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">With an open heart let me freely say how very proud I am of you and how often I boast about you. In fact,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">when I think of you</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">my heart is greatly encouraged and overwhelmed with joy, despite our many troubles.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Even after we came into the province of Macedonia,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">we found no relief. We were restless and exhausted; troubles met us at every turn. Outwardly I faced conflicts and inwardly emotional turmoil.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">But God, who always knows how to encourage the depressed, encouraged us greatly by the arrival of Titus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">We were relieved not only to see him but because of the report he brought us of how you refreshed his heart. He told us of your affection toward me, your deep remorse, and how concerned you were for me. This truly made my heart leap for joy!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Even if my letter made you sorrowful, I don&apos;t regret sending it (even though I felt awful for a moment when I heard how it grieved you).</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Now I&apos;m overjoyed&apos;not because I made you sad, but because your grief led you to a deep repentance. You experienced godly sorrow, and as God intended, it brought about gain for you, not loss, so that no harm has been done by us.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">God designed us to feel remorse over sin in order to produce repentance that leads to victory.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">This leaves us with no regrets. But the sorrow of the world works death.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Can&apos;t you see the good fruit that has come, as God intended, because of your remorse over sin?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Now you are eager to do what is right! Look at the indignation you experienced over what happened and how alarmed you became. What holy longing it awakened, what passion</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">for God</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">, and how ready you were to bring justice to the offender. Your response has proved that you are free of blame in this matter.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">So I wrote you not simply to correct the one who did the wrong or on the behalf of the one who was wronged, but to help you realize in God&apos;s sight how loyal you are to us.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Your response leaves us so encouraged! You&apos;ve made us even more joyful upon hearing of how you refreshed Titus, for his mind was set at ease by all of you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">I have not been embarrassed by you, for the things I bragged about you to Titus were not proven false. Just as everything we said to you was true, so our boasting to Titus about you has proven to be true as well.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">His affection toward you has grown as he remembers your obedience and how warmly you welcomed him with fear and trembling.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">I&apos;m beside myself with joy! I am so confident in you!</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="8">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Beloved ones, we must tell you about the grace God poured out upon the churches of Macedonia.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">For even during a season of severe difficulty, tremendous suffering, and extreme poverty, their super-abundant joy overflowed into an act of extravagant generosity.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">For I can verify that they spontaneously gave, not only according to their means but far beyond what they could afford.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">They</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">actually</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">begged us for the privilege of sharing in this ministry of giving to God&apos;s holy people</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">who are living in poverty</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">They exceeded our expectations by first dedicating themselves fully to the Lord and then to us, according to God&apos;s pleasure.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">That is why we appealed to Titus, since he was the one who got you started and encouraged you to give, so he could help you complete this generous undertaking on your behalf.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">You do well and excel in every respect&apos;in unstoppable faith, in powerful preaching, in revelation knowledge, in your passionate devotion, and in sharing the love we have shown to you. So make sure that you also excel in grace-filled generosity.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">I&apos;m not saying this as though I were issuing an order but to stir you to greater love by mentioning the enthusiasm</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">of the Macedonians</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">as a challenge to you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">For you have experienced the extravagant grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that although he was infinitely rich, he impoverished himself for our sake, so that by his poverty, we become rich</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">beyond measure</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">So here are my thoughts concerning this matter, and it&apos;s in your best interests. Since you made such a good start last year, both in the grace of giving and in your longing to give,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">you should finish what you started.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">You were so eager in your intentions to give, so go do it. Finish this act of worship according to your ability to give.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">For if the intention and desire are there,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">the size of the gift doesn&apos;t matter</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">. Your gift is fully acceptable to God according to what you have, not what you don&apos;t have.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">I&apos;m not saying this in order to ease someone else&apos;s load by overloading you, but as a matter of fair balance.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Your surplus could meet their need, and their abundance may one day meet your need. This equal sharing of abundance will mean a fair balance.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">As it is written: The one who gathered much didn&apos;t have too much, and the one who gathered little didn&apos;t have too little.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">We give thanks to God for putting the same devotion I have for you into the heart of Titus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Of course, he enthusiastically accepted our request to go to Corinth, but because he carries you in his heart, he&apos;d already planned on coming.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">So we&apos;re sending with him the brother</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">who is greatly honored and respected in all the churches for his work of evangelism.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Not only that, he has been appointed by the churches to be our traveling companion as we carry and dispense this generous gift that glorifies the Lord and shows how eager we are to help.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">We are sending a team</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">in order to avoid any criticism over how we handle this wonderfully generous gift,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">for we intend to do what is right and we are totally open both to the Lord&apos;s inspection and to man&apos;s.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">So we&apos;re sending with them another brother who is faithful and proven to be a man of integrity. He is passionate to help you now more than ever, for he believes in you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">Concerning the credentials of Titus, he&apos;s my partner and coworker in ministry for you. As for the brothers coming with him, they are apostles of the churches, which are the glory of the Anointed One.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">So demonstrate to them how much you love, and prove that our boasting of you is justified.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="9">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Actually, there&apos;s no need to write to you about this contribution for the holy believers</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">in Jerusalem</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">for I already know that you are on board and eager to help.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">I keep boasting to the churches of Macedonia about your passion to give, telling them that the believers of Corinth</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">have been preparing to give for a year. Your enthusiasm is contagious&apos;it has stirred many of them to do likewise.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Still, I thought it would be best to send these brothers to receive the offering that you&apos;ve prepared, so that our boasting about how you were ready to give would not be found hollow.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">For if, after boasting of our confidence in you, some of the Macedonians were to come with me and find that you were not prepared, we would be embarrassed&apos;to say nothing of you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">That&apos;s why I&apos;ve requested that the brothers come before I do and make arrangements in advance for the substantial offering you pledged. Then it will be seen as a matter of generosity and not under pressure, as something you felt forced to do.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Here&apos;s my point. A stingy sower</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">will reap a meager harvest, but the one who sows from a generous spirit will reap an abundant harvest.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Let giving flow from your heart, not from a sense of religious duty. Let it spring up freely from the joy of giving&apos;all because God loves hilarious generosity!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Yes, God is more than ready to overwhelm you with every form of grace, so that you will have more than enough of everything</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">&apos;every moment and in every way. He will make you overflow with abundance in every good thing you do.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Just as the Scriptures say</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">about the one who trusts in him</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">: Because he has sown extravagantly and given to the poor, his kindness and generous deeds will never be forgotten.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">This generous God who supplies abundant seed</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">for the farmer,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">which becomes</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">bread for our meals,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">is even more extravagant toward you. First he supplies</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">every need, plus more. Then he multiplies the seed</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">as you sow it</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">, so that the harvest of your generosity</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">will grow.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">You will be abundantly enriched in every way as you give generously on every occasion,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">for when we take your gifts to those in need,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">it causes many to give thanks to God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">The priestly ministry</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">you are providing through your offering not only supplies what is lacking for God&apos;s people, it inspires an outpouring</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">of praises and thanksgiving to God himself.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">For as your extremely generous offering meets the approval</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">of those in Jerusalem</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">, it will cause them to give glory to God&apos;all because of your loyal support and allegiance to the gospel of Christ, as well as your generous-hearted partnership with them toward those in need.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Because of this extraordinary grace, which God has lavished on you, they will affectionately remember you in their prayers.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Praise God for his astonishing gift, which is far too great for words!</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="10">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Now, please listen, for I need to address an issue. I&apos;m making this personal appeal to you by the gentleness</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">and self-forgetfulness of Christ. I am the one who is &apos;humble and timid&apos; when face-to-face with you but &apos;bold and outspoken&apos; when a safe distance away.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Now I plead with you that when I come, don&apos;t force me to take a hard line with you (which I&apos;m willing to do) by daring to confront</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">those who mistakenly believe that we are living by the standards of the world,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">not by the Spirit&apos;s wisdom and power</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">We can demolish every deceptive fantasy</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">that opposes God and break through every arrogant attitude that is raised up in defiance of the true knowledge of God. We capture, like prisoners of war, every thought</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">and insist that it bow in obedience to the Anointed One.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Since we are armed with such dynamic weaponry</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">, we stand ready to punish</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">any trace of rebellion, as soon as you choose complete obedience.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">You seem to always be looking at people by their outward appearances.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">If someone is confident that he belongs to Christ, he should remind himself of this: we belong to Christ no less than he does.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">I am not ashamed, even if I&apos;ve come across as one who has overstated the authority given to us by the Lord. For it is the authority to help build you up, not tear you down.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">I don&apos;t want to seem as though I&apos;m trying to bully you with my letters.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">For I can imagine some of you saying, &apos;His letters are authoritative and stern, but when he&apos;s with us he&apos;s not that impressive</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">and he&apos;s a poor speaker.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Such a person should realize that when we arrive, there will be no difference in the actions we take and the words we write.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Of course, we wouldn&apos;t dare to put ourselves in the same class or compare ourselves with those who rate themselves so highly. They compare themselves to one another</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">and make up their own standards to measure themselves by, and then they judge themselves by their own standards. What self-delusion!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">But we are those who choose to limit our boasting to only the measure of the work</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">to which God has appointed us&apos;a measure that, by the way, has reached as far as you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">And since you are within our assigned limits, we didn&apos;t overstep our boundaries of authority by being the first to announce to you the wonderful news of the Anointed One.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">We&apos;re not trying to take credit for the ministry done by others, going beyond the limits</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">God set for us</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">. Instead, our hope soars as your faith continues to grow, causing a great expansion of our ministry among you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Then we can go and preach the good news in the regions beyond you without trespassing on the ministry sphere of other laborers and what they have already done.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">For: The one who boasts must boast in the Lord.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">So let&apos;s be clear</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">. To have the Lord&apos;s approval and commendation is of greater value than bragging about oneself.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="11">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Now, please bear with some of my &apos;craziness&apos; for a moment. Yes, please be patient with me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">You need to know that</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">God&apos;s passion</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">is burning inside me for you, because, like a loving father, I have pledged your hand in marriage to Christ, your true bridegroom. I&apos;ve also promised that I would present his fianc&apos;e to him as a pure virgin bride.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">But now I&apos;m afraid that just as Eve was deceived by the serpent&apos;s clever lies, your thoughts may be corrupted and you may lose your single-hearted devotion and pure love for Christ.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">For you seem to gladly tolerate anyone</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">who comes to you preaching a pseudo-Jesus, not the Jesus we have preached. You have accepted a spirit and gospel that is false, rather than the Spirit and gospel you once embraced. How tolerant you have become of these imposters!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Now, I believe that I am not inferior in any way to these special &apos;super-apostles&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">you are attracted to.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">For although I may not be a polished or eloquent speaker, I&apos;m certainly not an amateur in revelation knowledge. Indeed, we have demonstrated this to you time and again.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Have I committed a sin by degrading myself to dignify you? Was I wrong to preach the gospel of God to you free of charge?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">I received ample financial support from other churches just so that I could</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">freely</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">serve you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Remember, when I was with you I didn&apos;t bother anyone when I needed money, for my needs were always supplied by my Macedonian friends.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">So I was careful, and will continue to be careful, that I never become a burden to you in any way.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">As the reality of Christ lives within me, my glad boast</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">of offering the gospel free of charge</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">will not be silenced throughout the region of Achaia.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Why? Is it because I have no love for you? God knows how much I love you!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">But in order to eliminate the opportunity for those &apos;super-apostles&apos; to boast that their ministry is on the same level as ours I will continue this practice.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">For they are not true apostles but deceitful</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">ministers who masquerade as &apos;special apostles&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">of the Anointed One.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">That doesn&apos;t surprise us, for even Satan transforms himself to appear as an angel of light!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">So it&apos;s no wonder his servants also go about pretending to be ministers of righteousness. But in the end they will be exposed and get exactly what they deserve.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">So I repeat. Let no one think that I&apos;m a fool. But if you do, at least show me the patience you would show a fool, so that I too may boast a little.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Of course, what I&apos;m about to tell you is not with the Lord&apos;s authority, but as a &apos;fool.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">For since many love to boast about their worldly achievements,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">allow me the opportunity to join them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">And since you are so smart and so wise to gladly put up with the foolishness of others,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">now put up with mine</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">You actually allow these imposters to put you into bondage, take complete advantage of you, and rob you blind! How easily you endure those who, in their arrogance, destroy your dignity or even slap you in the face.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">I must admit, to our shame that we were too &apos;weak&apos; to relate to you the way they do. But now let me dare to boast like a &apos;fool.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Are these &apos;super-apostles&apos; of yours Hebrews? I am too. Are they Israelites? So am I. Are they descendants of Abraham? Me too!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">Are they servants of the Anointed One? I&apos;m beside myself when I speak this way, but I am much more of a servant than they. I have worked much harder for God, taken more beatings, and been dragged to more prisons than they. I&apos;ve been flogged excessively, multiple times, even to the point of death.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">Five times I&apos;ve received thirty-nine lashes from the Jewish leaders.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">Three times I experienced being beaten with rods.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">Once they stoned me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">Three times I&apos;ve been shipwrecked;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">for an entire night and a day I was adrift in the open sea.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">In my difficult travels I&apos;ve faced many dangerous situations: perilous rivers, robbers, foreigners, and even my own people. I&apos;ve survived deadly peril in the city, in the wilderness, with storms at sea, and with spies posing as believers.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">I&apos;ve toiled to the point of exhaustion and gone through many sleepless nights. I&apos;ve frequently been deprived of food and water, left hungry and shivering out in the cold, lacking proper clothing.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">And besides these painful circumstances, I have the daily pressure of my responsibility for all the churches, with a deep concern weighing heavily on my heart for their welfare.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">I am not aloof</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">, for who is</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">desperate and</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">weak and I do not feel their weakness? Who is led astray into sin and I do not burn with zeal</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">to restore him</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">If boasting is necessary, I will boast about examples of my weakness.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">The God and Father of the Lord Jesus, who is eternally praised, knows that I am speaking the truth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">Once, when I was in Damascus, the governor</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">under King Aretas</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">had his troops searching for me to have me arrested,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">but I was stuffed in a basket</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">and lowered down through a window and managed to escape.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="12">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Although it may not accomplish a thing, I need to move on and boast about supernatural visions and revelations of the Lord.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Someone I&apos;m acquainted with, who is in union with Christ, was swept away fourteen years ago in an ecstatic experience. He was taken into the third heaven,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">but I&apos;m not sure if he was in his body or out of his body&apos;only God knows.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">And I know that this man</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">(again, I&apos;m not sure if he was still in his body or taken out of his body&apos;God knows)</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">was caught up in an ecstatic experience and brought into paradise,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">where he overheard many wondrous and inexpressible secrets</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">that were so sacred</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">that no mortal is permitted to repeat them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">I&apos;m ready to boast of such an experience, but for my own good I refuse to boast unless it concerns my weaknesses.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">However, if I were to boast, it wouldn&apos;t be ridiculous at all, for I would be speaking the truth. Yet I will refrain, lest others think higher of me than what I demonstrate with my life and teaching.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">The extraordinary level of the revelations I&apos;ve received is no reason for anyone to exalt me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">For this is why a thorn in my flesh was given to me, the Adversary&apos;s messenger sent to harass me,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">keeping me from becoming arrogant.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Three times I pleaded with the Lord to relieve me of this.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">But he answered me,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">&apos;My grace is always more than enough for you,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">and my power finds its full expression through your weakness.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">So I will celebrate my weaknesses, for when I&apos;m weak I sense more deeply the mighty power of Christ living in me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">So I&apos;m</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">not defeated</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">by my weakness, but delighted! For when I feel my weakness and endure mistreatment&apos;when I&apos;m surrounded with troubles on every side and face persecution</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">because of my love</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">for Christ&apos;I am made yet stronger. For my weakness becomes a portal to God&apos;s power.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">I have become foolish</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">to boast like this</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">, but you have forced me to do it, when you should have boasted in me instead. For there is nothing I lack compared to these &apos;super-apostles&apos; of yours, even though I am nothing.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">The things that distinguish a true apostle were performed among you with great perseverance&apos;supernatural signs, startling wonders, and awesome miracles.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Furthermore, how were you treated worse than the other churches, except that I didn&apos;t burden you financially&apos;forgive me for depriving you!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">And now here I am, ready to come to you for the third time,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">and I still refuse to be a burden to you. For what I really want is your hearts, not your money. After all, children should not have to accumulate resources for their parents, but parents do this for their children.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">And as a spiritual father to you</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">, I will gladly spend all that I have and all that I am for you!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">If I love you more, will you respond by loving me less?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Be that as it may, I haven&apos;t been a burden to you at all, yet you say of me, &apos;He&apos;s a scoundrel and a trickster!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">But let me ask you this</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">. Did I somehow cheat or trick you through any of the men I sent your way?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">I was the one who insisted that Titus and our brother come</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">and help you</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">. Did Titus take advantage of you? Didn&apos;t we all come to you in the same spirit,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">following in the ways of integrity</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">I hope that you don&apos;t assume that all this time we have simply been justifying ourselves in your eyes? Beloved ones, we have been speaking to you in the sight of God as those joined to Christ, and everything we do is meant to build you up and make you stronger in your faith.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Now I&apos;m afraid that when I come to you I may find you different than I desire you to be, and you may find me different than you would like me to be. I don&apos;t want to find you in disunity, with jealousy and angry outbursts, with selfish ambition, slander, gossip, arrogance, and turmoil.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">I&apos;m actually afraid that on my next visit my God will humble me in front of you as I shed tears over those who keep sinning without repenting of their impurity, sexual immorality, and perversion.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="13">
			<VERS vnumber="1">This will be my third trip to you. And I will make sure that by the testimony of two or three witnesses every matter will be confirmed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">For although he was crucified as a &apos;weakling,&apos; now he lives</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">robed</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">with God&apos;s power. And we also are &apos;weak ones&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">in our co-crucifixion</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">with him, but now we live in God&apos;s triumphant power together with him, which is demonstrated on your behalf.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Now your souls will be strengthened and healed if you hold steadfast to your faith.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Haven&apos;t you already experienced Jesus Christ himself living in you? If not, you are deficient.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">I hope you understand that we cannot be devalued.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">But we pray to God that you will be flawless,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">not to validate our ministry among you but so that you may continue on the path of righteousness even if we are denigrated.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">For in reality, the power we have is used in support of the truth, not against it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">And we claim before God</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">that you will be fully equipped and mature, for it brings us great joy when you are strong, even if we seem weak and denigrated.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">I&apos;m writing my honest feelings to you from afar so that when I arrive I won&apos;t have to correct you by using the authority the Lord has given me, for I want to build you up and not tear you down.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Finally, beloved friends,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">be cheerful! Repair whatever is broken among you, as your hearts are being knit together in perfect unity. Live continually in peace, and God, the source of love and peace, will mingle with you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Greet and embrace one another with the sacred kiss.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">All of God&apos;s holy people send their greetings.</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="1">
			<VERS vnumber="1">From Paul,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">an apostle</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">of Jesus Christ. My apostleship was not granted to me by men, for I was appointed by Jesus Christ, and God the Father, who raised him from the dead.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">All the brothers and sisters</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">join with me as I write this letter to the churches throughout the region of central Turkey.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">May God&apos;s undeserved kindness and total well-being</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">that flow from our Father God and from the Lord Jesus be yours.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">He&apos;s the Anointed One who offered himself</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">as the sacrifice</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">for our sins! He has rescued us from this evil world system</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">and set us free, just as our Father God desired.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">May all the glory be to God alone, throughout time and eternity. Amen!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">I am shocked over how quickly you have strayed away from the One who called you in the grace of Christ. I&apos;m astounded that you now embrace a distorted</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">gospel!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">That is a fake &apos;gospel&apos; that is simply not true. There is only one gospel&apos;the good news of Christ! Yet you have allowed those who mingle law with grace to confuse you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">But even if we or an angel from heaven should preach a gospel different than the one we preached to you, let them be under God&apos;s curse!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Let me make it clear: Anyone, no matter who they are, that brings you a different gospel than the gospel that you have received, let them be condemned and cursed!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">I&apos;m obviously not trying to flatter you or water down my message to be popular with men, but my supreme passion is to please God. For if all I attempt to do is please people, I would fail to be a true servant of Christ.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Beloved ones, let me repeat emphatically that the gospel entrusted to me was not given to me by any man.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">No one taught me this revelation, for it was given to me directly by the unveiling of Jesus Christ.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">By now you have heard stories of how severely</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">I harassed and persecuted Christians and how systematically I endeavored to destroy God&apos;s church, all because of my radical devotion to the Jewish religion.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">My zeal and passion for the doctrines of Judaism distinguished me among my people, for I was far more advanced in my religious instruction than others my age.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">But then God called me by his grace, and chose me from my birth to be his.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">He was pleased to unveil his Son in me so that I would proclaim him to the peoples of the world. After I had this encounter, I kept it a secret for some time, sharing it with no one.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">And I had no desire to run to Jerusalem and try to impress those who had become apostles before me. Instead, I withdrew into the Arabian Desert. Then I returned to Damascus,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">where I had first encountered Jesus</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">I remained there for three years until I eventually went up to Jerusalem, met the apostle Peter,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">and stayed with him for a couple of weeks.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">The only other apostle I met during that time was Jacob,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">the Lord&apos;s brother.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Everything I&apos;m describing to you I confess before God to be the absolute truth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">After my stay in Jerusalem, I went to Syria and southeast Turkey,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">but I remained unknown to the churches</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">in Judea.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">The only thing they heard about me was this: &apos;Our former enemy, who once brutally persecuted us, is now preaching the good news of the faith that he tried to destroy!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">Because of the transformation that took place in my life</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">, they praised God even more!</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="2">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Fourteen years later, I returned to Jerusalem, this time with Barnabas</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">and Titus,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">my coworkers</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">God</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">gave me a clear revelation</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">to go and confer with the other apostles concerning the message of grace I was preaching to the gentiles. I spoke privately with those who were viewed as senior leaders of the church, wanting to make certain that my labor and ministry for the Messiah had not been based on a false understanding of the gospel.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Even though Titus</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">was a Syrian,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">they accepted him as a brother</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">without demanding that he first be circumcised.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">I met with them privately</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">because false &apos;brothers&apos; had been secretly smuggled into church meetings. They were sent to spy on the</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">wonderful</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">freedom that we have in Jesus Christ. Their agenda was to bring us back into the bondage</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">of religion</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">But you must know that we did not submit to their religious shackles,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">not even for a moment, so that we might keep the truth of the gospel</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">of grace</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">unadulterated for you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Even those most influential among the brothers were not able to add anything to my message. Who they are before men makes no difference to me, for God is not impressed by their reputations.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">So they recognized that I was entrusted with taking the gospel to the gentiles</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">just as Peter was entrusted with taking it to the Jews.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">For the same God who empowered Peter&apos;s apostolic ministry to the Jews also flowed through me as an apostle to those who are gentiles.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">When they all recognized this grace operating in my ministry, those who were recognized as influential pillars</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">in the church&apos;Jacob, Peter, and John&apos;extended to Barnabas and me the warmth of Christian fellowship</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">and honored my calling to</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">minister to</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">the gentiles, even as they were to go to the Jews.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">They simply requested one thing of me: that I would remember the poor and needy, which was the burden I was already carrying in my heart.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">When Peter visited Antioch,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">he</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">caused the believers to stumble over his behavior</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">, so I confronted him to his face.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">He enjoyed eating with the gentile believers who didn&apos;t keep the Jewish customs&apos;up until the time Jacob&apos;s Jewish friends arrived from Jerusalem. When he saw them, he withdrew from his gentile friends&apos;fearing how it would look to them</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">if he ate with gentile believers</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">And so, because of Peter&apos;s hypocrisy,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">many other Jewish believers followed suit, refusing to eat with gentile believers. Even Barnabas was led astray by their hypocritical behavior!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">So when I realized they were acting inconsistently with the revelation of the gospel, I confronted Peter in front of everyone: &apos;You were born a Jew, but you&apos;ve chosen to disregard Jewish regulations and live like a gentile. Why then do you force gentiles to conform to these same rules?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Although we&apos;re Jews by birth and not gentile &apos;sinners,&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">we know that no one receives God&apos;s perfect righteousness as a reward for keeping the law, but only by the faith of Jesus, the Messiah!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">His faithfulness has saved us, and we have received God&apos;s perfect righteousness. Now we know that God accepts no one by the keeping of</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">religious</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">laws!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">If we are those who desire to be righteous through our union with the Anointed One, does that mean our Messiah condones sin even though we acknowledge that we are sinners? How absurd!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">For if I start over and reconstruct the old religious system that I had torn down</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">with the message of grace</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">, I would appear to be a lawbreaker.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">For through the law I died to the law,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">so that I might live to God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">My old identity has been co-crucified with Christ and no longer lives. And now the essence of this new life is no longer mine, for the Anointed One lives his life through me&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">we live in union as one</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">My new life is empowered by the faith of the Son of God who loves me so much that he gave himself for me,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">dispensing his life into mine</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">So that is why I don&apos;t view God&apos;s grace as something peripheral.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">For if keeping the law could release God&apos;s righteousness to us, then Christ would have died for nothing.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="3">
			<VERS vnumber="1">What has happened to you foolish Galatians? Who has put you under an evil spell?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">Did God not open your eyes to see the meaning of Jesus&apos; crucifixion? Was he not revealed to you as the crucified one?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">So answer me this: Did the Holy Spirit come to you as a reward for keeping</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Jewish laws</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">? No, you received him as a gift because you believed in the Messiah.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Your new life began when the Holy Spirit gave you a new birth. Why then would you so foolishly turn from living in the Spirit by trying to finish by your own works?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Have you endured so many trials and persecutions for nothing?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Let me ask you again: What does the lavish supply of the Holy Spirit in your life and the miracles of God&apos;s tremendous power have to do with you keeping religious laws? The Holy Spirit is poured out upon us through the revelation and power of faith!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Abraham,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">our father of faith</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">, believed God, and the substance of his faith released God&apos;s righteousness to him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">So the true children of Abraham have the same faith as their father!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">And the Scripture prophesied that on the basis of faith God would declare gentiles to be righteous. God announced the good news ahead of time to Abraham: &apos;Through your example of faith, all the nations will be blessed!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">And so the blessing of Abraham&apos;s faith is now our blessing too!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">But if you rely on works of keeping the law</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">for salvation</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">, you live under the law&apos;s curse. For it is clearly written: &apos;Utterly cursed is everyone who fails to practice every detail and requirement that is written in this law!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">It is obvious that no one achieves the righteousness of God by attempting to keep the law, for it is written: &apos;The one who is in a right relationship with God will live by faith!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">But keeping the law does not require faith,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">but self-effort</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">. For the law teaches, &apos;If you practice the principles of law, you must follow all of them.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Yet, Christ paid the full price to set us free from the curse of the law. He absorbed the curse completely as he became a curse in our place. For it is written: &apos;Everyone who is hung upon a tree is cursed.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Jesus Christ dissolved the curse from our lives, so that in him all the blessings of Abraham can be poured out upon gentiles. And now through faith we receive the promised Holy Spirit</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">who lives in us</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Beloved friends, let me use an illustration that we can all understand. Technically, when a contract is signed, it can&apos;t be changed after it has been put into effect; it&apos;s too late to alter the agreement.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Remember the royal proclamation</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">God spoke over Abraham and to Abraham&apos;s child? God said that his promises were made to pass on to Abraham&apos;s &apos;Child,&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">not children. And who is this &apos;Child?&apos; It&apos;s</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">the Son of promise</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">, Christ himself!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Why then was the law given at all? It was given alongside the promise to show people their sins. But the law was designed to last only until the coming of the &apos;Seed,&apos; the child who was promised. When God gave the law, he gave it first to angels; they gave it to</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Moses</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">, his mediator, who then gave it to the people.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Now, a mediator does not represent just one party alone, but God fulfilled it all by himself!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Since that&apos;s true, should we consider the written law to be contrary to the promise of new life? How absurd!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Truly, if there was a law that we could keep which would give us new life, then our salvation would have come by law-keeping.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">But the Scriptures make it clear that the whole world is imprisoned by sin! This was so the promise would be given through faith to people who believe in Jesus Christ.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">So until the revelation of faith for salvation was released, the law was a jailer, holding us as prisoners under lock and key until the &apos;faith,&apos; which was destined to be revealed,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">would set us free</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">The law was our guardian until Christ came so that we would be saved by faith.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">But now that faith has come</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">we are no longer under the guardian</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">of the law</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">You have all become true children of God by faith in Jesus Christ!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">Faith immersed you into Christ, and now you are covered and clothed with his life.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">And we no longer see each other</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">in our former state</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">&apos;Jew or non-Jew, rich or poor,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">male or female&apos;because we&apos;re all one through our union with Jesus Christ.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">And if you belong to Christ, then you are now Abraham&apos;s &apos;child&apos; and a true heir of all his blessings because of the promise</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">God made to Abraham</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">!</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="4">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Let me illustrate: As long as an heir is a minor, he&apos;s not really much different than a servant, although he&apos;s the master over all of them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">For until the time appointed by the father, the child is under the domestic supervision of the guardians of the estate.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">So it is with us. When we were juveniles we were enslaved under the hostile spirits of the world.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">But when the time of fulfillment had come, God sent his Son, born of a woman,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">born under the law.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Yet all of this was so that he would redeem and set free those held hostage to the law so that we would receive our freedom and a full legal adoption as his children.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">And so that we would know that we are his true children,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">God released the Spirit of Sonship into our hearts&apos;moving us to cry out intimately, &apos;My Father!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">My true Father!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Now we&apos;re no longer living like slaves</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">under the law</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">, but we enjoy being God&apos;s very own sons and daughters! And because we&apos;re his,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">we can access everything our Father has</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">&apos;for we are heirs because of what God has done!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Before we knew God</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">as our Father</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">, we were unwitting servants to the powers that be, which are nothing compared to God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">But now that we truly know him and are intimately known by him, why would we for a moment consider turning back to those weak and feeble principles of religion, as though we were still subject to them?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Why would we want to scrupulously observe rituals like special days,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">celebrations of the new moon, annual festivals, and sacred years?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">I&apos;m so alarmed about you that I&apos;m beginning to wonder if my labor in ministry among you was a waste of time!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Beloved ones, I plead with you, brothers and sisters, become like me, for I became like you. You did me no wrong.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">You are well aware that the reason I stayed among you to preach the good news was because of the poor state of my health.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">And yet you were so kind to me and did not despise me in my weakness,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">even though my physical condition put you through an ordeal while I was with you. Actually, you received me and cared for me as though I were an angel from God, as you would have cared for Jesus Christ himself!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Some of you were even willing, if it were possible, to pluck out your own eyes to replace mine! Where is that kindhearted and free spirit now?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Have I really become your enemy because I tell you the truth?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Can&apos;t you see what these false teachers</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">are doing? They want to win you over so you will side with them. They want you divided from me so you will follow only them. Would you call that integrity?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Isn&apos;t it better to seek excellence and integrity always, and not just only when I&apos;m with you?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">You are my dear children, but I agonize in spiritual &apos;labor pains&apos; once again, until the Anointed One will be fully formed in your hearts!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">How I wish I could be there in person and change my tone toward you, for I am truly dumbfounded over what you are doing!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">Ishmael</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">, the son of the slave girl, was born of the natural realm. But</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">Isaac</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">, the son of the freewoman, was born</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">supernaturally by the Spirit</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">&apos;a child of the promise of God!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">These two women and their sons express an allegory and become symbols of two covenants. The first covenant was born on Mount Sinai, birthing children into slavery&apos;children born to Hagar.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">For &apos;Hagar&apos; represents the law given at Mount Sinai in Arabia.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">The &apos;Hagar&apos; metaphor</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">corresponds to the earthly Jerusalem of today who are currently in bondage.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">In contrast, there is a heavenly Jerusalem above us, which is our true &apos;mother.&apos; She is the freewoman, birthing children into freedom!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">For it is written: &apos;Burst forth with gladness, rejoice, O barren woman with no children, break through with the shouts of joy and jubilee, for you are about to give birth! The one who was once considered desolate and barren now has more children than the one who has a husband!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">Dear friends,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">just like Isaac, we&apos;re now the true children who inherit the kingdom promises.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">And just as the son of the natural world at that time harassed the son born of the power of the Holy Spirit, so it is today.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">And what does the Scripture tell us to do? &apos;Expel the slave mother with her son! The son of the slave woman will not be a true heir&apos; for the true heir of the promises is the son of the freewoman.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">It&apos;s now so obvious! We&apos;re not the children of the slave woman; we&apos;re the supernatural sons of the freewoman&apos;</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="5">But we have the true hope that comes from being made right with God, and by the Spirit we wait eagerly for this hope.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">When you&apos;re joined to the Anointed One, circumcision and religious obligations can benefit you nothing. All that matters now is living in the faith that works and expresses itself through love.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Before you were led astray, you were so faithful.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Who has deceived you so that you have turned from what is right?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">The One who enfolded you into his grace is not behind this false teaching that you&apos;ve embraced.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Don&apos;t you know that when you allow even a little lie into your heart, it can permeate your entire belief system?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Deep in my heart I have confidence that the Lord, who lives in you, will bring you back around to the truth. And I&apos;m convinced that those who trouble you, whoever they think they are, will bear the penalty!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Dear friends, why do you think the religious system persecutes me? Is it because I preach the message of being circumcised and keeping all the laws of Judaism? Not at all! Is there no longer any offense over the cross?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">To tell you the truth, I am so disgusted with all your agitators. I wish they would go even further and cut off their legalistic influence from your lives!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Beloved ones, God has called us to live a life of freedom. But don&apos;t view this wonderful freedom as an excuse to set up a base of operations in the natural realm. Constantly love each other and be committed to serve one another.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">For all the law can be summarized in one grand statement: &apos;Demonstrate love to your neighbor, even as you care for and love yourself.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">But if you continue to criticize and come against each other over minor issues, you&apos;re acting like wild beasts trying to destroy one another!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Let me emphasize this: As you yield to the dynamic life and power of the Holy Spirit, you will abandon the cravings of your self-life.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">When your self-life craves the things that offend the Holy Spirit</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">you hinder him from living free within you</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">! And the Holy Spirit&apos;s intense cravings hinder your self-life from dominating you! So then, the two incompatible and conflicting forces within you are your self-life of the flesh and the new creation life of the Spirit.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">But when you yield to the life of the Spirit,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">you will no longer be living under the law,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">but soaring above it</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">The behavior of the self-life is obvious: Sexual immorality, lustful thoughts, pornography,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">chasing after things instead of God,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">manipulating others,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">hatred of those who get in your way, senseless arguments, resentment when others are favored, temper tantrums, angry quarrels, only thinking of yourself, being in love with your own opinions,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">being envious of the blessings of others, murder, uncontrolled addictions,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">wild parties, and all other similar behavior. Haven&apos;t I already warned you that those who use their &apos;freedom&apos; for these things will not inherit the kingdom realm of God!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">Keep in mind that we who belong to Jesus Christ have already experienced crucifixion. For everything connected with our self-life</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">was put to death on the cross and crucified with Messiah.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">If the Spirit is the source of our life, we must also allow the Spirit to direct every aspect of our lives.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">So may we never be arrogant, or look down on another,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">for each of us is an original</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">. We must forsake all jealousy that diminishes the value of others.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1">My beloved friends, if you see a believer who is overtaken with a fault,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">the one who is in the Spirit should seek to restore him in the Spirit of gentleness. But keep watch over your own heart so that you won&apos;t be tempted to exalt yourself over him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Love empowers us to</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">fulfill the law of the Anointed One as we carry each other&apos;s troubles.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">If you think you are somebody too important to stoop down to help another (when really you are not), you are living in deception.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Let everyone be devoted to fulfill the work God has given them to do with excellence, and their joy will be in doing what&apos;s right and being themselves, and not in</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">being affirmed by</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">others.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Every believer is ultimately responsible for his or her own conscience.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">And those who are taught the Word must share all good things with their teacher.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">God will never be mocked! For what you plant will always be the very thing you harvest.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">The harvest you reap reveals the seed that you planted</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">. If you plant the corrupt seeds of self-life into this natural realm, you can expect a harvest of corruption. If you plant the good seeds</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">of Spirit-life you will reap</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">beautiful fruits that grow</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">from the everlasting life of the Spirit.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">And don&apos;t allow yourselves to be weary in planting good seeds, for the season of reaping the wonderful harvest you&apos;ve planted is coming!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Take advantage of every opportunity to be a blessing to others,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">especially to our brothers and sisters in the family of faith!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">I&apos;ve written this letter to you with my own handwriting&apos;see how large I have to make the letters?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">All those who insist that you be circumcised are recruiting you so they can boast in their own achievement. They seek to avoid the persecution that comes with preaching the liberating message of the cross of Messiah!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Not even those who are circumcised keep every detail of the written law. Yet they push you to be circumcised so that they can boast that you have become like them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">May my only boast be found in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ. In him I have been crucified to this natural realm;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">and the natural realm is dead to me</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">and no longer dominates my life</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Whether a man is circumcised or uncircumcised is meaningless to me. What really matters is the transforming power of this new creation life.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">And all those who live in agreement with this standard will have true peace and God&apos;s delight, for they are the Israel of God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">From now on, let no one cause me to suffer further, for I am carrying the very scars</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">of our Lord Jesus in my body.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Finally my beloved ones&apos;may the wonderful grace of our Lord Jesus, the Anointed One, be flowing in your spirit.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1">Dear friends</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">, My name is Paul, and I was chosen by God to be an apostle of Jesus, the Messiah.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">I&apos;m writing this letter to all the devoted believers</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">who have been made holy</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">by being one with Jesus, the Anointed One. May God himself, the heavenly Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, release grace over you and impart total well-being into your lives.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Every spiritual blessing in the heavenly realm has already been lavished upon us as a love gift from our wonderful heavenly Father, the Father of our Lord Jesus&apos;all because he sees us wrapped into Christ. This is why we celebrate him</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">with all our hearts!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">And in love he chose us before he laid the foundation of the universe!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Because of his great love, he ordained us, so that we would be seen as holy in his eyes with an unstained innocence.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Since we are now joined to Christ, we have been given the treasures of redemption by his blood&apos;the total cancellation</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">of our sins&apos;all because of the cascading riches</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">of his grace.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">This</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">superabundant</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">grace is already powerfully working in us,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">releasing all forms of wisdom and practical understanding.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">And through the revelation of the Anointed One, he unveiled his secret desires to us&apos;the hidden mystery of his long-range plan, which he was delighted to implement from the very beginning of time.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">And because of God&apos;s unfailing purpose, this detailed plan will reign supreme through every period of time until the fulfillment of all the ages finally reaches its climax&apos;when God makes all things new</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">in all of heaven and earth through Jesus Christ.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Through our union with Christ we too have been claimed by God as his own inheritance.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Before we were even born, he gave us our destiny;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">that we would fulfill the plan of God who always accomplishes every purpose and plan in his heart.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">God&apos;s purpose was that we</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Jews</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">, who were the first to long for the messianic hope, would be the first to believe in the Anointed One and bring great praise and glory to God!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">And because of him, when you</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">who are not Jews</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">heard the revelation</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">of truth, you believed in the wonderful news of salvation. Now we have been stamped with the seal of the promised Holy Spirit.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">He is given to us like an engagement ring,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">as the first installment of what&apos;s coming! He is our hope-promise of a future inheritance</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">which seals us until we have all of redemption&apos;s promises and experience complete freedom&apos;all for the supreme glory and honor of God!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Because of this, since I first heard about your strong faith in the Lord Jesus Christ and your tender love toward all his devoted ones,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">my heart is always full and overflowing with thanks to God for you as I constantly remember you in my prayers.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">I pray that the Father of glory, the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, would impart to you the riches of the Spirit of wisdom and the Spirit of revelation</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">to know him through your deepening intimacy with him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">I pray that the light of God will illuminate the eyes of your imagination,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">flooding you with light, until you experience the full revelation of the hope of his calling</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">&apos;that is, the wealth of God&apos;s glorious inheritances that he finds in us, his holy ones!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">I pray that you will continually experience the immeasurable greatness of God&apos;s power made available to you through faith. Then your lives will be an advertisement of this immense power as it works through you! This is the mighty power</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">that was released when God raised Christ from the dead and exalted him</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">to the place of highest honor and supreme authority</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">in the heavenly realm!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">And now he is exalted as first above every ruler, authority, government, and realm of power in existence! He is gloriously enthroned over every name that is ever praised,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">not only in this age,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">but in the age that is coming!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">And he alone is the leader and source of everything needed in the church. God has put everything beneath the authority of Jesus Christ</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">and has given him the highest rank above all others</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">And now we, his church, are his body on the earth and that which fills him who is being filled by it!</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="2">
			<VERS vnumber="1">And his fullness fills you</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">, even though you were once like corpses,</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="2">It wasn&apos;t that long ago that you lived in the religion, customs, and values</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">of this world,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">obeying the dark ruler of the earthly realm who fills the atmosphere with his authority, and works diligently in the hearts of those who are disobedient to the truth of God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">The corruption that was in us from birth was expressed through the deeds and desires of our self-life. We lived by whatever natural cravings and thoughts our minds dictated, living as rebellious children subject to God&apos;s wrath like everyone else.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">But God still loved us with such great love. He is so rich in compassion and mercy.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Even when we were dead and doomed in our many sins, he united us into the very life of Christ and saved us by his wonderful grace!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">He raised us up with Christ the exalted One,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">and we ascended with him into the glorious perfection and authority</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">of the heavenly realm, for we are now co-seated</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">as one with Christ!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Throughout the coming ages</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">we will be the visible display of the infinite riches of his grace and kindness, which was showered upon us in Jesus Christ.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">For by grace you have been saved by faith. Nothing you did could ever earn this salvation, for it was the love gift</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">from God that brought us to Christ!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">So no one will ever be able to boast, for salvation is never a reward for good works or human striving.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">We have become his poetry,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">a re-created people that will fulfill the destiny he has given each of us, for we are joined to Jesus, the Anointed One. Even before we were born, God planned in advance</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">our destiny</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">and the good works</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">we would do</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">to fulfill it</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Yet look at you now! Everything is new!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Although you were once distant and far away from God, now you have been brought delightfully close to him through the sacred blood of Jesus&apos;you have actually been united to Christ!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Our reconciling &apos;Peace&apos; is Jesus! He has made Jew and non-Jew one</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">in Christ</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">By dying as our sacrifice</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">, he has broken down every wall of prejudice that separated us</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">and has now made us equal through our union with Christ</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Ethnic hatred has been dissolved by the crucifixion of his precious body on the cross. The legal code that stood condemning every one of us has now been repealed</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">by his command</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">. His triune essence has made peace between us by starting over&apos;forming</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">one new race of humanity,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Jews and non-Jews fused together in himself!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Two have now become one, and we live restored to God and reconciled in the body of Christ. Through his crucifixion, hatred died.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">For the Messiah has come to preach this sweet message of peace to you,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">the ones who were distant, and to those who are near.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">And now, because we are united to Christ, we both have equal and direct access in the realm of the Holy Spirit to come before the Father!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">So, you are not foreigners or guests, but rather you are the children of the city of the holy ones,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">with all the rights as family members of the household of God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">You are rising like the perfectly fitted stones of the temple</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="20">and your lives have been built up together upon the foundation laid by the apostles and prophets, and best of all, you are connected to the Head Cornerstone of the building, the Anointed One, Jesus Christ himself!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">This entire building is under construction and is continually growing under his supervision until it rises up completed as the holy temple of the Lord himself.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">This means that God is transforming each one of you into</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1">Beloved friends,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">because of my love for Jesus Christ</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="2">so that you will hear the gospel that God has entrusted to me to share with you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">For this wonderful mystery, which I briefly described, was given to me by divine revelation,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">so that whenever you read it you will be able to understand my revelation and insight into the secret mystery of the Messiah.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">There has never been a generation that has been given the detailed understanding of this glorious and divine mystery until now. He kept it a secret until this generation. God is revealing it only now to his sacred apostles and prophets by the Holy Spirit.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Here&apos;s the secret: The gospel of grace has made you, non-Jewish believers, into coheirs of his promise through your union with him. And you have now become members of his body&apos;one with the Anointed One!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">My passion is to enlighten every person to this divine mystery. It was hidden for ages past until now, and kept a secret in the heart of God, the Creator of all.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">The purpose of this was to unveil before every throne and rank of angelic orders in the heavenly realm God&apos;s full and diverse wisdom revealed through the church.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">This perfectly wise plan was destined from eternal ages and fulfilled completely in our Lord Jesus Christ, so that now</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">we have boldness through him,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">and free access as kings</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">before the Father because of our complete confidence in Christ&apos;s faithfulness.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">My dear friends, I pray that you will remain strong and not be discouraged or ashamed by all that I suffer on your behalf, for it is for your glory.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">So I kneel humbly in awe before the Father of our Lord Jesus, the Messiah,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">the perfect Father of every father and child</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">in heaven and on the earth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">And I pray that he would unveil within you the unlimited riches of his glory and favor until supernatural strength floods your innermost being with his divine might and explosive power.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Then, by constantly using your faith, the life of Christ will be released deep inside you, and the resting place of his love will become the very source and root of your life.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Never doubt</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">God&apos;s mighty power to work in you and accomplish all this. He will achieve infinitely more than your greatest request, your most unbelievable dream, and exceed your wildest imagination!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">He will outdo them all, for his miraculous power constantly energizes you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Now we offer up to God all the glorious praise that rises from every church in every generation through Jesus Christ&apos;and all that will yet be manifest through time and eternity. Amen!</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="8">This is why he says: &apos;He ascends into the heavenly heights taking his many captured ones with him, and gifts were given to men.&apos;</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="20">But this is not the way of life that Christ has unfolded within you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">If you have really experienced the Anointed One, and heard his truth,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">it will be seen in your life</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">; for we know that the ultimate reality</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">is embodied in Jesus!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">And he has taught you to let go of the lifestyle of the ancient man,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">the old self-life, which was corrupted by sinful and deceitful desires that spring from delusions.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="4">Guard your speech. Forsake obscenities and worthless insults; these are nonsensical words that bring disgrace and are unnecessary. Instead, let worship fill your heart and spill out in your words.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">For it has been made clear to you already that the kingdom of God cannot be accessed by anyone who is guilty of sexual sin, or who is impure or greedy&apos;for greed is the essence of idolatry. How could they expect to have an inheritance in Christ&apos;s kingdom</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="2">May the blessings of divine grace and supernatural peace that flow from God our wonderful Father, and our Messiah, the Lord Jesus, be upon your lives.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="6">I pray with great faith for you</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="9">I continue to pray for your love to grow and increase beyond measure, bringing you into the rich revelation of spiritual insight</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="10">This will enable you to choose</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">the most excellent way of all</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">&apos;becoming pure and without offense until the unveiling of Christ.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">And you will be filled completely with the fruits of righteousness</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">that are found in Jesus, the Anointed One&apos;bringing great praise and glory to God!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">I want you to know, dear ones,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">what has happened to me has not hindered, but helped my ministry of preaching the gospel, causing it to expand and spread to many people.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">For now the elite Roman guards and government officials</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">overseeing my imprisonment have plainly recognized that I am here because of my love for the Anointed One.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">And what I&apos;m going through has actually caused many believers</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">to become even more courageous in the Lord and to be bold and passionate to preach the Word of God, all because of my chains.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">It&apos;s true that there are some who preach Christ out of competition and controversy, for they are jealous</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">over the way God has used me</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">. Many others</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">have purer motives</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">&apos;they preach with grace and love filling their hearts,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">because they know I&apos;ve been destined for the purpose of defending the revelation of God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Those who preach Christ with ambition and competition are insincere&apos;they just want to add to the hardships of my imprisonment.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Yet in spite of all of this I am overjoyed! For what does it matter as long as Christ is being preached? If they preach him with mixed motives or with genuine love, the message of Christ is still being preached.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">And I will continue to rejoice</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">because I know that the lavish supply</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">of the Spirit of Jesus, the Anointed One, and your intercession for me will bring about my deliverance.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">No matter what, I will continue to hope and passionately cling</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">to Christ, so that he will be openly revealed through me before everyone&apos;s eyes.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">So I will not be ashamed!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">In my life or in my death, Christ will be magnified in me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">My true life is the Anointed One, and dying means gaining more of him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">Yet deep in my heart I&apos;m confident that I will be spared so I can add to your joy and further strengthen and mature your faith.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">When I am freed to come to you, my deliverance will give you a reason to boast even more in Jesus Christ.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">Whatever happens, keep living your lives based on the reality of the gospel of Christ. Then when I come to see you, or hear good reports of you, I&apos;ll know that you stand united in one Spirit and one passion&apos;celebrating together as conquerors</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">in the faith of the gospel.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">And then you will never be shaken or intimidated by the opposition that rises up against us. Your courage will prove to be a sure sign from God of their coming destruction.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">For God has graciously given you the privilege not only to believe in Christ, but also to suffer for him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">For you have been called by him to endure the conflict in the same way I have endured it&apos;for you know I&apos;m not giving up.</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="2">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Look at how much encouragement</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">you&apos;ve found in your relationship with the Anointed One! You are filled to overflowing with his comforting love. You have experienced a deepening friendship with the Holy Spirit and have felt his tender affection and mercy.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">So I&apos;m asking you, my friends, that you be joined together in perfect unity&apos;with one heart, one passion, and united in one love. Walk together</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">with one harmonious purpose and you will fill my heart with unbounded joy.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Be free from pride-filled opinions,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">for they will only harm your cherished unity</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">. Don&apos;t allow self-promotion to hide in your hearts, but in authentic humility put others first and view others as more important than yourselves.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Abandon every display of selfishness. Possess a greater concern for what matters to others instead of your own interests.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">And consider the example that Jesus, the Anointed One, has set before us. Let his mindset become your motivation.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">He existed in the form of God, yet he gave no thought to seizing equality with God as his supreme prize.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Instead he emptied himself of his outward glory by reducing himself to the form of a lowly servant. He became human!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">He humbled himself and became vulnerable, choosing to be revealed as a man and was obedient.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">He was a perfect example</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">, even in his death&apos;a criminal&apos;s death by crucifixion!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Because of that obedience, God exalted him and multiplied his greatness! He has now been given the greatest of all names!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">The authority of the name of Jesus causes every knee to bow in reverence! Everything and everyone will one day submit to this name&apos;in the heavenly realm, in the earthly realm, and in the demonic realm.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">And every tongue will proclaim in every language: &apos;Jesus Christ is Lord Yahweh,&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">bringing glory and honor to God, his Father!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">My beloved ones, just like you&apos;ve always listened to everything I&apos;ve taught you in the past, I&apos;m asking you now to keep following my instructions as though I were right there with you. Now you must continue to make this new life fully manifested as you live</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">in the holy awe of God&apos;which brings you trembling into his presence.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">God will continually revitalize you, implanting within you the passion to do what pleases him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Live a cheerful life, without complaining or division among yourselves.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">For then you will be seen as innocent,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">faultless, and pure children of God, even though you live in the midst of a brutal and perverse culture.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">For you will appear among them as shining lights</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">in the universe,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">holding out</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">the words of</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">eternal</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">life. I haven&apos;t labored among you for nothing, for your lives are the fruit of my ministry and will be my glorious boast at the unveiling of Christ!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">But I will rejoice even if my life is poured out like a liquid offering to God over your sacrificial and surrendered lives of faith.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">And so no matter what happens to me, you should rejoice in ecstatic celebration with me!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Yet I&apos;m trusting in our Lord Jesus that I may send Timothy to you soon, so I can be refreshed when I find out how you&apos;re doing.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Timothy is like no other. He carries the same passion for your welfare that I carry in my heart.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">For it seems as though everyone else is busy seeking what is best for themselves instead of the things that are most important to our Lord Jesus Christ.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">You already know about his excellent reputation, since he has served alongside me as a loyal son in the work of ministry.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">After I see what transpires with me he&apos;s the one I will send to you to bless you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">And I&apos;m trusting in my Lord to return to you in due time.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">But for now, I feel a stirring in my heart to send Epaphroditus</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">back to you immediately. He&apos;s a friend to me and a wonderful brother and fellow soldier who has worked with me</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">as we serve as ministers of the gospel</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">. And you sent him as your apostle to minister to me in my need.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">But now he is grieved to know that you found out he had been sick, so he longs to return and comfort you in this.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">It&apos;s true he almost died, but God showed him mercy and healed him. And I&apos;m so thankful to God for his healing, as I was spared from having the sorrow of losing him on top of all my other troubles!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">So you can see why I&apos;m delighted to send him to you now. I know that you&apos;re anxious to see him and rejoice in his healing, and it encourages me to know how happy you&apos;ll be to have him back.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">So warmly welcome him home in the Lord,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">with joyous love, and esteem him highly, for people like him deserve it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">Because of me, he put his life on the line, despising the danger, so that he could provide for me with what you couldn&apos;t, since you were so far away. And he did it all because of his ministry for Christ.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1">My beloved ones, don&apos;t ever limit your joy or fail to rejoice in the wonderful experience of knowing our Lord Jesus! I don&apos;t mind repeating what I&apos;ve already written you because it protects you&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">beware of those religious hypocrites</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">who teach that you should be circumcised to please God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">For we have already experienced &apos;heart-circumcision,&apos; and we worship God in the power and freedom of the Holy Spirit,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">not in laws and religious duties</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">. We are those who boast in what Jesus Christ has done, and not in what we can accomplish in our own strength.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">It&apos;s true that</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">I once relied on all that I had become</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">. I had a reason to boast and impress people with my accomplishments&apos;more than others&apos;for my pedigree was impeccable.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">I was born a true Hebrew of the heritage of Israel</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">as the son of a Jewish man from the tribe of Benjamin.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">I was circumcised eight days after my birth and</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">was raised in the strict tradition of Orthodox Judaism</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">, living a separated</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">and devout life as a Pharisee.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">And concerning the righteousness of the Torah,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">no one surpassed me; I was without a peer. Furthermore, as a fiery defender of the truth, I persecuted the messianic believers with religious zeal.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Yet all of the accomplishments that I once took credit for, I&apos;ve now forsaken them and I regard it all as nothing compared to the delight of experiencing Jesus Christ as my Lord!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">To truly know him meant letting go of everything from my past and throwing all my boasting on the garbage heap. It&apos;s all like a pile of manure to me now, so that I may be enriched in the reality of knowing Jesus Christ and embrace him as Lord in all of his greatness.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">My passion is to be consumed with him and not cling to my own &apos;righteousness&apos; based in keeping the written Law. My only &apos;righteousness&apos; will be his, based on the faithfulness of Jesus Christ&apos;the very righteousness that comes from God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">And I continually long to know the wonders of Jesus and to experience the overflowing power of his resurrection working in me. I will be one with him in his sufferings and become like him in his death.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Only then will I be able to experience complete oneness with him in his resurrection from the realm of death.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">I admit that I haven&apos;t yet acquired the absolute fullness that I&apos;m pursuing, but I run with passion</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">into his abundance</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">so that I may reach the purpose for which Christ Jesus laid hold of me to make me his own.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">I don&apos;t depend on my own strength to accomplish this;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">however I do have one compelling focus: I forget all of the past as I fasten my heart to the future instead.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">I run straight for the divine invitation of reaching the heavenly goal and gaining the victory-prize through the anointing of Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">So let all who are fully mature have this same passion, and if anyone is not yet gripped by these desires,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">God will reveal it to them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">And let us all advance together to reach this victory-prize, following one path with one passion.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">My beloved friends, imitate my walk with God and follow all those who walk according to the way of life we modeled before you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">For there are many who live by different standards. As I&apos;ve warned you many times (I weep as I write these words), they are enemies of the cross of the Anointed One and</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">doom awaits them. Their god has possessed them and made them mute.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Their boast is in their shameful lifestyles and their minds are in the dirt.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">But we are a colony</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">of heaven on earth as we cling tightly to our life-giver, the Lord Jesus Christ,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">who will transform our humble bodies</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">and transfigure us into the identical likeness of his glorified body.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="3">Every time we pray for you our hearts overflow with thanksgiving to Father God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">For we have heard of your devoted lives of faith in Christ Jesus and your tender love toward all his holy believers.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Your faith and love rise within you as you access all the treasures of your inheritance</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">stored up in the heavenly realm. For the revelation of the true gospel is as real today as the day you first heard of our glorious hope, now that you have believed in the truth of the gospel.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">This is the wonderful message that</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">is being spread everywhere, powerfully changing hearts throughout the earth, just like it has changed you! Every believer of this good news bears the fruit of eternal life as they experience the reality of God&apos;s grace.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Our beloved coworker, Epaphras,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">was there from the beginning to thoroughly teach you the astonishing revelation of the gospel, and he serves you faithfully as Christ&apos;s representative.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">He&apos;s informed us of the many wonderful ways love is being demonstrated through your lives by the empowerment of the Holy Spirit.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Since we first heard about you, we&apos;ve kept you always in our prayers that you would receive the perfect knowledge of God&apos;s pleasure</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">over your lives, making you reservoirs of every kind of wisdom and spiritual understanding.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">We pray that you would walk in the ways of true righteousness, pleasing God in every good thing you do. Then you&apos;ll become fruit-bearing branches, yielding to his life, and maturing in the rich experience of knowing God in his fullness!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">And we pray that you would be energized with all his explosive power from the realm of his magnificent glory, filling you with great hope.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Your hearts can soar with</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">joyful gratitude when you think of how God made you worthy to receive the glorious inheritance freely given to us by living in the light.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">He has rescued us completely from the tyrannical rule</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">of darkness and has translated us into the kingdom realm of his beloved Son.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">For in the Son all our sins are canceled and we have the release of redemption</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">through his very blood</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">He is the divine portrait, the true likeness of the invisible God, and the firstborn heir of all creation.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">For in him was created the universe of things, both in the heavenly realm and on the earth, all that is seen and all that is unseen. Every seat of power, realm of government, principality, and authority&apos;it all exists through him and for his purpose!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">He existed before anything was made, and now everything finds completion in him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">He is the Head of his body, which is the church. And since he is the beginning and the firstborn heir in resurrection,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">he is the most exalted One, holding first place</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">in everything.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">For God is satisfied to have all his fullness</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">dwelling in Christ.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">And by the blood of his cross, everything in heaven and earth is brought back to himself&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">back to its original intent, restored to innocence again</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">if indeed you continue to advance in faith, assured of a firm foundation to grow upon. Never be shaken from the hope of the gospel you have believed in. And this is the glorious news I preach all over the world.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">I can even celebrate the sorrows I have experienced on your behalf; for as I join with you in your difficulties, it helps you to discover what lacks</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">in your understanding</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">of the sufferings Jesus Christ experienced for his body, the church.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">This is the very reason I&apos;ve been made a minister by the authority of God and a servant to his body, so that in his detailed plan I would fully equip you with the Word of God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">There is a divine mystery&apos;a secret surprise that has been concealed from the world for generations, but now it&apos;s being revealed, unfolded and manifested for every holy believer to experience.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">Living within you is the Christ who floods you with the expectation of glory! This mystery of Christ, embedded within us, becomes a heavenly treasure chest of hope filled with the riches of glory for his people, and God wants everyone to know it!</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="2">
			<VERS vnumber="1">I wish you could know how much I have struggled</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">for you and for the church in Laodicea, and for the many other friends I&apos;ve yet to meet.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">I am contending for you that your hearts will be wrapped in the comfort of heaven and woven together into love&apos;s fabric. This will give you access</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">to all the riches of God as you experience the revelation of God&apos;s great mystery&apos;Christ.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">For our spiritual wealth is in him, like hidden treasure waiting to be discovered&apos;heaven&apos;s wisdom and endless riches of revelation knowledge.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">I want you to know this so that no one will come and lead you into error</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">through their persuasive arguments and clever words.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Even though I&apos;m separated from you geographically, my spirit is present there with you. And I&apos;m overjoyed to see how disciplined</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">and deeply committed you are because you have such a solid faith in Christ, the Anointed One.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">In the same way you received Jesus our Lord and Messiah by faith, continue your journey of faith, progressing further into your union with him!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Your spiritual roots go deeply into his life as you are continually infused with strength, encouraged in every way. For you are established in the faith you have absorbed and enriched by your devotion to him!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Beware that no one distracts you or intimidates you</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">in their attempt to lead you away from Christ&apos;s fullness</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">by pretending to be full of wisdom when they&apos;re filled with endless arguments of human logic. For they operate with humanistic and clouded judgments based on the mindset of this world system, and not the anointed truths of the Anointed One.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">For he is the complete fullness of deity living in human form.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">And our own completeness is now found in him. We are completely filled</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">with God</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">as Christ&apos;s fullness overflows within us. He is the Head</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">of every kingdom and authority in the universe!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Through our union with him we have experienced circumcision of heart. All of the guilt and power of sin</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">has been cut away and is now extinct because of what Christ, the Anointed One, has accomplished for us.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">For we&apos;ve been buried with him into his death. Our &apos;baptism into death&apos; also means we were raised with him when we believed in God&apos;s resurrection power, the power that raised him from death&apos;s realm.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">This &apos;realm of death&apos; describes our former state, for we were held in sin&apos;s grasp.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">But now, we&apos;ve been resurrected out of that &apos;realm of death&apos; never to return, for we are forever alive and forgiven of all our sins!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">He canceled out every legal violation we had on our record and the old arrest warrant that stood to indict us. He erased it all&apos;our sins, our stained</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">soul&apos;he deleted it all</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">and they cannot be retrieved</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">! Everything we once were in Adam</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">has been placed onto his cross and nailed permanently there as a public display of cancellation.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Then Jesus made a public spectacle of all the powers and principalities of darkness, stripping away from them every weapon and all their spiritual authority and power</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">to accuse us. And by the power of the cross, Jesus led them around as prisoners in a procession of triumph.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">He was not their prisoner; they were his!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">So why would you allow anyone</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">to judge you because of what you eat or drink, or insist that you keep the feasts, observe new moon celebrations, or the Sabbath?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">All of these were but a prophetic shadow and the evidence of what would be fulfilled,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">for the body</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">is now Christ!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Don&apos;t let anyone disqualify you from your prize! Don&apos;t let their pretended sincerity fool you as they deliberately lead you into their initiation of angel worship.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">For they take pleasure in pretending to be experts of something they know nothing about. Their reasoning is meaningless and comes only from their own opinions.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">They refuse to take hold of the true source. But we receive directly from him , and his life supplies vitality into every part of his body through the joining ligaments connecting us all as one. He is the divine Head who guides his body and causes it to grow by the supernatural power of God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">For you were included in the death of Christ and have died with him to the religious system and powers of this world. Don&apos;t retreat back to being bullied by the standards and opinions of religion&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">for example, their strict requirements</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">, &apos;You can&apos;t associate with that person!&apos; or, &apos;Don&apos;t eat that!&apos; or, &apos;You can&apos;t touch that!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">These are the doctrines of men and corrupt customs that are worthless to help you spiritually.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">For though they may appear to possess the promise of wisdom in their submission to God through the deprivation of their physical bodies, it is actually nothing more than empty rules rooted in religious rituals!</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="3">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Christ&apos;s resurrection is your resurrection too. This is why we are to yearn for all that is above, for that&apos;s where Christ sits enthroned at the place of all power, honor, and authority!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Yes,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">feast on all the treasures of the heavenly realm</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">and fill your thoughts with heavenly realities, and not with the distractions of the natural realm.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Your crucifixion</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">with Christ has severed the tie to this life, and now your true life is hidden away in God in Christ.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">And as Christ himself is seen for who he really is, who you really are will also be revealed, for you are now one with him in his glory!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Live as one who has died to every form of sexual sin and impurity. Live as one who has died to the desires for forbidden things,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">including the desire for wealth, which is the essence of idol worship.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">When you live in these vices you ignite the anger of God against these acts of disobedience.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">and lying.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Lay aside</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">your old Adam-self with its masquerade and disguise.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">For you have acquired new creation life which is continually being renewed into the likeness of the One who created you; giving you the full revelation of God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">In this new creation life, your nationality makes no difference, nor your ethnicity, education, nor economic status&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">they matter nothing</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">. For it is Christ that means everything as he lives in every one of us!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">You are always and dearly loved by God! So robe yourself</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">with virtues of God</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">, since you have been divinely chosen to be holy. Be merciful as you endeavor to understand others, and be compassionate, showing kindness toward all. Be gentle and humble, unoffendable in your patience with others.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Tolerate the weaknesses of those in the family of faith, forgiving one another in the same way you have been graciously forgiven by Jesus Christ. If you find fault with someone, release this same gift of forgiveness to them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">For love is supreme and must flow through each of these virtues. Love becomes the mark</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">of true maturity.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Let your heart be always guided</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="4">Dear brothers and sisters,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">you are dearly loved by God and we know that he has chosen you to be his very own.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="5">Surely you remember how we lived our lives transparently before you to encourage you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">And you became followers</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">of my example and the Lord&apos;s when you received the word with the joy of the Holy Spirit, even though it resulted in tremendous trials and persecution.</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="2">
			<VERS vnumber="1">My dear brothers and sisters, it&apos;s obvious that our ministry among you has proven to be fruitful.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">And though we had already suffered greatly in Philippi, where we were shamefully mistreated,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">we were emboldened</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">by faith</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">in our God to fearlessly preach his wonderful gospel to you in spite of incredible opposition.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Our coming alongside you to encourage you was not out of some delusion, or impure motive, or an intention to mislead you,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">but we have been approved by God to be those who preach the gospel. So our motivation to preach is not pleasing people but pleasing God, who thoroughly examines our hearts.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">God is our witness that when we came to encourage you, we never once used cunning compliments as a pretext for greed,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">nor did we crave the praises of men, whether you or others.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Even though we could have imposed upon you our demands as apostles of Christ,</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="7">We cared for you in the same way a nursing mother cares for her own children.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">With a mother&apos;s love and affectionate attachment to you, we were very happy to share with you not only the gospel of God but also our lives&apos;because you had become so dear to us.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Beloved brothers and sisters, surely you remember how hard we labored among you. We worked night and day so that we would not become a burden to you while we preached the wonderful gospel of God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">With God as our witness you saw how we lived among you&apos;in holiness, in godly relationships,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">and without fault.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">And you know how affectionately we treated each one of you, like a loving father cares for his own children.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">We comforted and encouraged you and challenged you to adopt a lifestyle worthy of God, who invites you into his kingdom and glory.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">This is why we continually thank God</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">for your lives</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">, because you received our message</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">wholeheartedly</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">. You embraced it not as the fabrication of men but as the word of God. And the word continues to be an energizing force in you who believe.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">My dear</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">brothers and sisters, the same thing happened to you as happened to God&apos;s churches in Christ Jesus that are in Judea. For you received the same kind of mistreatment from your fellow countrymen as they did from theirs, the Jews</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">who killed both the Lord Jesus and the prophets and ran us out of town. They are offending God and hostile to everyone else</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">by hindering us from speaking to the unbelievers</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">so that they might be saved. By so doing they are constantly filling up to the brim the measure of their guilt,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">and punishment</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">has come upon them at last!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Beloved friends, we may have been torn away</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">from you physically for a season, but never in our hearts. For we have had intense longings and have endeavored to come and see in your faces the reflection of this great love.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">We</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="18">, and I personally wanted to come to you, trying again and again, but our adversary,</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="5">For this reason, when I could endure it no longer, I sent</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1">And now,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">beloved</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">brothers and sisters, since you have been mentored by us with respect to living for God and pleasing him, I appeal to you in the name of the Lord Jesus with this request: keep faithfully growing through our teachings even more and more.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">For you already know the instructions we&apos;ve shared with you through the Lord Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">God&apos;s will is for you to be set apart for him in holiness and that you keep yourselves</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">unpolluted</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">from sexual defilement.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Yes, each of you must guard your sexual purity</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">with holiness and dignity,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">not yielding to lustful passions like those who don&apos;t know God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Never take selfish advantage</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">of a brother or sister in this matter, for we&apos;ve already told you and solemnly warned you that the Lord is the avenger in all these things.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">For God&apos;s call on our lives is not to a life of</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">compromise and</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">perversion but to a life surrounded in holiness.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Therefore, whoever rejects this instruction isn&apos;t rejecting human authority but God himself, who gives</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">us his precious gift</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">&apos;his Spirit of holiness.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">There&apos;s no need for anyone to say much to you about loving your fellow believers, for God is continually teaching you to unselfishly love one another.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Indeed, your love is what you&apos;re known for throughout Macedonia. We urge you, beloved ones, to let this unselfish love increase</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">and flow through you</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">more and more.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Aspire</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">to lead a calm and peaceful life as you mind your own business</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">and earn your living, just as we&apos;ve taught you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">By doing this you will live an honorable life, influencing others and commanding respect of even the unbelievers. Then you&apos;ll be in need of nothing and not dependent upon others.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Beloved brothers and sisters, we want you to be quite certain about the truth concerning those who have passed away,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">so that you won&apos;t be overwhelmed with grief like many others who have no hope.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, we also believe that God will bring with Jesus those who died while believing in him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">This is the word of the Lord:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">we who are alive</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">in him</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">and remain until the Lord appears will by no means have an advantage over those who have already died,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">for both will rise together</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">For the Lord himself will appear with the declaration of victory, the shout of an archangel, and the trumpet blast of God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">He will descend from the heavenly realm</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">and</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">command</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">those who are dead in Christ to rise first.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Then we who are alive will join them, transported together</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">in clouds</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">to have an encounter</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">with the Lord in the air,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">and we will be forever joined with the Lord.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">So encourage one another with these truths.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="5">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Now, beloved brothers and sisters, concerning the question of</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">God&apos;s</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">precise times and specific seasons,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">you don&apos;t need me to write anything to you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">For you already know quite well that the day of the Lord</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">will come unexpectedly and as a complete surprise.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">For while some are saying, &apos;Finally we have peace and security,&apos; sudden destruction will arrive at their doorstep, like labor pains seizing a pregnant woman&apos;and with no chance of escape!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">But you, beloved brothers and sisters, are not living in the dark, allowing that day to creep up on you like a thief</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">coming to steal</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">For you are all children of the light and children of the day. We don&apos;t belong to the night nor to darkness.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">This is why we must not fall asleep, as the rest do, but keep wide awake and clearheaded.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">For those who are asleep sleep the night away, and drunkards get drunk at night.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">But since we belong to the day, we must stay alert and clearheaded by placing the breastplate of faith and love</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">over our hearts</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">, and a helmet of the hope of salvation</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">over our thoughts</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">For God has not destined us for wrath but to possess salvation through our Lord Jesus, the Anointed One.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">He gave his life for us so that we may share in resurrection life</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">in union with him&apos;whether we&apos;re awake or asleep.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Because of this, encourage the hearts of your fellow believers and support one another, just as you have already been doing.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Dear brothers and sisters, make sure that you show your deep appreciation for those who cherish you and diligently work as ministers among you. For they are your leaders who care for you, teach you, and stand before the Lord on your behalf.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">They value you with great love. Because of their service to you, let peace reign among yourselves.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">We appeal to you, dear brothers and sisters, to instruct those who are not in their place of battle.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Be skilled at</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">gently encouraging those who feel themselves inadequate.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Be faithful</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">to stand your ground. Help the weak to stand again. Be</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">quick to</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">demonstrate patience with everyone.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Resist revenge, and make sure that no one pays back evil in place of evil but always pursue doing what is beautiful to one another and to all</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">the unbelievers</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Let joy be your continual feast.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Make your life a prayer.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">And in the midst of everything be always giving thanks, for this is God&apos;s perfect plan for you in Christ Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Never</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">restrain or</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">put out the fire of the Holy Spirit.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">And don&apos;t be one who scorns prophecies,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">but be faithful to examine them by putting them to the test, and afterward hold tightly to what has proven to be right.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Avoid every appearance of evil.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">Now, may the God of peace and harmony set you apart, making you completely holy. And may your entire being&apos;spirit, soul, and body&apos;be kept completely flawless in the appearing of our Lord Jesus, the Anointed One.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">The one who calls you by name is trustworthy and will thoroughly complete his work in you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">Now, beloved ones, pray for us.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">Greet every brother and sister with a sacred kiss.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">I solemnly</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">plead with you before the Lord to make sure that every holy believer among you has the opportunity to hear this letter read to them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">May grace from our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. Amen!</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="1">
			<VERS vnumber="1">From Paul, Silas,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">and Timothy.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">We send our greetings</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">to you, the Thessalonian congregation</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">of believers, which is in God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">May God&apos;s delightful grace</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">and peace rest upon you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">We feel a personal responsibility to continually be thanking God for you, our spiritual family,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">every time we pray. And we have every reason to do so because your faith is growing marvelously beyond measure. The unselfish love each of you share for one another is increasing and overflowing!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">We point to you as an example of</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">unwavering faith</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">for all the churches of God. We boast about how you continue to demonstrate unflinching endurance</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">through all the persecutions and painful trials you are experiencing.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">All of this proves that God&apos;s judgment is always perfect and is intended to make you worthy of</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">inheriting</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">the kingdom of God, which is why you are going through these troubles.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">It is right and just for God to trouble your troublers</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">and give rest to the troubled, both to you and to us, at the unveiling</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">of the Lord Jesus from heaven with his messengers of power</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">within a flame of fire. He will bring perfect and full justice to those who don&apos;t know God</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">and on those who refuse to embrace the gospel of our Lord Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">They will suffer the penalty of eternal destruction, banished from the Lord&apos;s presence</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">and from the manifestation of his glorious power.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">This will happen</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">on that day when he glorifies his holy ones,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">and they will be marveled at in all those who believed&apos;including you, since in fact, you believed our message.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">With this in mind, we constantly pray that our God will empower you to live worthy of all that he has invited you to experience.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">And we pray that by his power all the pleasures of goodness and all works inspired by faith would fill you completely.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">By doing this the name of our Lord Jesus will be glorified in you, and you will be glorified in him, by the</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">marvelous</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="2">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Now, regarding the coming</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">of our Lord Jesus Christ and our gathering together to him,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">we plead with you, beloved friends,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">not to be easily confused or disturbed in your minds by any kind of spirit, rumor, or letter allegedly from us, claiming that the day of the Lord</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">has already come.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Don&apos;t let anyone deceive you in any way. Before that day comes the rebellion</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">must occur and the &apos;outlaw&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">&apos;the destructive son&apos;will be revealed</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">in his true light</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">He is the opposing counterpart who exalts himself over everything that is called &apos;God&apos; or is worshiped</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">and who sits enthroned in God&apos;s temple</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">and makes himself out to be a god.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Don&apos;t you remember that when I was with you I went over all these things?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Now you are aware of the ruling power</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">so that he may be fully revealed when his time comes.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">For the mystery of lawlessness</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">is already active, but the one who prevails</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">will do so until he is separated from out of the midst.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Then the &apos;outlaw&apos; will be openly revealed, and the Lord will overthrow him by the breath of his mouth</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">and bring him to an end</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">by the dazzling manifestation of his presence.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">The presence</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">of the &apos;outlaw&apos; is apparent by the activity of Satan, who uses all kinds of</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">counterfeit</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">miracles, signs, spurious wonders,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">and every form of evil deception in order to deceive those who are perishing because they rejected the love of the truth</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">that would lead them to being saved.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Because of this, God sends them a powerful delusion</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">that leads them to believe what is false.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">So then all who found their pleasure in unrighteousness and did not believe the truth will be judged.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">We always have to thank God for you, brothers and sisters, for you are</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">dearly</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">loved by the Lord. He proved it by choosing you from the beginning for salvation</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">through the Spirit, who set you apart for holiness, and through your belief in the truth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">To this end he handpicked you for salvation through the gospel so that you would have</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">So then, dear family, stand firm with a masterful grip of the teachings</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">we gave you, either by word of mouth or by our letter.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Now may the Lord Jesus Christ and our Father God, who loved us and in his wonderful grace gave us eternal comfort and a beautiful hope that cannot fail,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">encourage your hearts and inspire you with strength to always do and speak what is good and beautiful</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">in his eyes</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="3">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Finally, dear brothers and sisters, pray for us that the Lord&apos;s message will continue to spread rapidly and its glory be recognized everywhere, just as it was with you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">And pray that God will rescue us from wicked</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">and evil people, for not everyone believes</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">the message</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">But the Lord Yahweh</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">is always faithful</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">to place you on a firm foundation and guard you from the Evil One.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">We have complete confidence in the Lord concerning you</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">and we are sure that you are doing and will continue to do what we have told you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Now may the Lord move your hearts into</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">a greater understanding of</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">God&apos;s pure love for you and into Christ&apos;s steadfast endurance.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Beloved brothers and sisters, we instruct you, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, to stay away from believers who are unruly</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">and who stray from all that we have taught you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">For you know very well that you should order your lives after our example, because we were not undisciplined when we were with you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">We didn&apos;t sponge off of you, but we worked hard night and day to provide our own food and lodging and not be a burden to any of you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">It wasn&apos;t because we don&apos;t have the right to be supported,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">but we wanted to provide you an example to follow.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">For when we were with you we instructed you with these words: &apos;Anyone who does not want to work for a living should go hungry.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Now, we hear rumors that some of you are being lazy</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">and neglecting to work&apos;that these people are not busy but busybodies!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">So with the authority of the Lord Jesus Christ, we order them to go back to work in an orderly fashion and exhort them to earn their own living.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Brothers and sisters, don&apos;t ever grow weary in doing what is right.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Take special note of anyone who won&apos;t obey what we have written and stay away from them, so that they would be ashamed and get turned around.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Yet don&apos;t regard them as enemies, but caution them as fellow believers.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Now, may the Lord himself, the Lord of peace, pour into you his peace in every circumstance and in every possible way. The Lord&apos;s</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">tangible</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">presence be with you all.</VERS>

	<BIBLEBOOK bnumber="54" bname="1  Timothy">
		<CHAPTER cnumber="1">
			<VERS vnumber="1">From Paul, an apostle in Christ Jesus, for it was Jesus himself, our living hope, who sent me as his servant by the command of God, our life-giver.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Timothy, you are my true spiritual son in the faith. May abundant grace, mercy, and total well-being</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">from God the Father and the Anointed One, our Lord Jesus, be yours!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">As I urged you when I left for Macedonia,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">I&apos;m asking that you remain in Ephesus to instruct them not to teach or follow the error of deceptive doctrines,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">nor pay any attention to cultural myths, traditions, or the endless study of genealogies.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Those digressions only breed controversies and debates. They are devoid of power that builds up and strengthens the church in the faith of God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">For we reach the goal of fulfilling all the commandments when we love others deeply with a pure heart, a clean conscience, and sincere faith.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Some believers have been led astray by teachings and speculations that emphasize nothing more than the empty words of men.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">They presume to be expert teachers of the law,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">but they don&apos;t have the slightest idea of what they&apos;re talking about and they simply love to argue!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">We know that the moral code of the law is beautiful when applied as God intended,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">but actually, the law was not established for righteous people, but to bring conviction of sin to the unrighteous. The law was established to bring the revelation of sin to the evildoers and rebellious, the sinners without God, those who are vicious and perverse, and to those who strike their father or their mother,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">sinners, murderers,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">rapists, those who are sexually impure, homosexuals,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">kidnappers, liars, those who break their oaths, and all those who oppose the teaching of godliness and purity in the church!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">They are the ones the law is for</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">I have been commissioned to preach the wonderful news of the glory of the exalted God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">My heart spills over with thanks to God for the way he continually empowers me, and to our Lord Jesus, the Anointed One, who found me trustworthy and who authorized me to be his partner in this ministry.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Mercy kissed me, even though I used to be a blasphemer, a persecutor of believers, and a scorner of what turned out to be true. I was ignorant and didn&apos;t know what I was doing.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">I was flooded with such incredible grace,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">like a river overflowing its banks</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">until I was full of faith and love for Jesus, the Anointed One!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">I can testify that the Word is true and deserves to be received by all, for Jesus Christ came into the world to bring sinners back to life&apos;even me, the worst sinner of all!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Yet I was captured by grace, so that Jesus Christ could display through me the outpouring of his Spirit</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">as a pattern to be seen for all those who would believe</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">in him for eternal life.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Because of this my praises rise to the King of all the universe</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">who is indestructible,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">invisible, and full of glory, the only God</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">who is worthy of the highest honors throughout all of time and throughout the eternity of eternities! Amen!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">such as Hymenaeus</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">and Alexander</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">who have fallen away. I have delivered them both over to Satan to be rid of them and to teach them to no longer blaspheme!</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1">Most of all, I&apos;m writing to encourage you to pray with gratitude to God. Pray for all men with all forms of prayers and requests as you intercede with intense passion.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">And pray for every political leader</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">and representative,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">so that we would be able to live tranquil, undisturbed lives, as we worship the awe-inspiring God with pure hearts.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">It is pleasing to our Savior-God</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">to pray for them</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">He longs for everyone to embrace his life and return to the full knowledge of the truth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">For God is one, and there is one Mediator between God and the sons of men&apos;the true man, Jesus, the Anointed One.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">He gave himself as ransom-payment for everyone. Now is the proper time for God to give the world this witness.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">I have been divinely called as an apostle to preach this revelation, which is the truth. God has called me to be a trustworthy teacher to the nations.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Therefore, I encourage the men to pray on every occasion</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">with hands lifted to God in worship with clean hearts, free from frustration or strife.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">And that the women</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">would also pray</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">with clean hearts, dressed appropriately and adorned modestly and sensibly, not flaunting their wealth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">But</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">they should be recognized</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">instead by their beautiful deeds of kindness, suitable as one who worships God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Let the women</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">who are new converts</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">be willing to learn with all submission to their leaders and not speak out of turn.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">I don&apos;t advocate that the</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">newly converted</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">women be the teachers in the church, assuming authority over the men, but to live in peace.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">For God formed Adam first,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">then Eve.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Adam did not mislead Eve, but Eve misled him and violated the command of God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Yet salvation will come through a child born by a woman, and women will be saved by that &apos;child&apos; if they continue in faith with love, holiness, and self-control.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1">If any of you</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">aspires to be an overseer</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">in the church; you have set your heart toward a noble ambition, for the word is true!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Yet an elder needs to be one who is without blame before others. He should be one whose heart is for his wife alone and not another woman . He should be recognized as one who is sensible, and well-behaved, and living a disciplined life. He should be a &apos;spiritual shepherd&apos; who has the gift of teaching, and is known for his hospitality.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">He cannot be a drunkard, or someone who lashes out at others,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">or argumentative, or someone who simply craves more money,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">but instead, recognized by his gentleness.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">His heart should be set on guiding his household with wisdom and dignity;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">bringing up his children to worship with devotion and purity.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">For if he&apos;s unable to properly lead his own household well, how could he properly lead God&apos;s household?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">He should not be a new disciple</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">who would be vulnerable to living in the clouds of conceit and fall into pride, making him easy prey for Satan.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">He should be respected by those who are unbelievers, having a beautiful testimony among them</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">so that he will not fall into the traps of Satan and be disgraced.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">And in the same way the deacons</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">must be those who are pure and true to their word, not addicted to wine, or with greedy eyes on the contributions.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Instead, they must faithfully embrace the mysteries of faith while keeping a clean conscience.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">And each of them must be found trustworthy according to these standards before they are given the responsibility to minister as servant-leaders without blame.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">And the women</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">also who serve the church should be dignified,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">faithful in all things,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">having their thoughts set on truth, and not known as those who gossip.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">A deacon&apos;s heart must be toward his wife alone, leading his children and household with excellence.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">For those who serve in this way will obtain an honorable reputation</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">for themselves and a greater right to speak boldly in the faith that comes from Jesus Christ!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">I&apos;m writing all this with the expectation of seeing you soon.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">But if I&apos;m delayed in coming, you&apos;ll already have these instructions on how to conduct the affairs of the church of the living God, his very household and the supporting pillar and firm foundation of the truth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">For the mystery of righteousness is beyond all question! He was revealed as a human being, and as our great High Priest in the Spirit! Angels gazed upon him as a man and the glorious message of his kingly rulership is being preached to the nations! Many have believed in him and he has been taken back to heaven, and has ascended into the place of exalted glory in the heavenly realm . Yes, great is this mystery of righteousness!</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1">The Holy Spirit has explicitly revealed:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">At the end of this age, many will depart from the true faith one after another, devoting themselves to spirits</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">of deception and following demon-inspired revelations and theories.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Hypocritical liars</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">will deceive many, and their consciences won&apos;t bother them at all!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">They will require celibacy and dietary restrictions that God doesn&apos;t expect, for he created all foods to be received with the celebration of faith by those who fully know the truth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">We know that all creation is beautiful to God and there is nothing to be refused if it is received with gratitude.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">All that we eat is made sacred by the Word of God and prayer.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">If you will teach the believers these things, you will be known as a faithful and good minister of Jesus, the Anointed One. Nurture others in the living words of faith and in the knowledge of grace which you were taught.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Be quick to abstain from senseless traditions</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">and legends,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">but instead be engaged in the training of truth that brings righteousness.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">For athletic training only benefits you for a short season, but righteousness brings lasting benefit in everything; for righteousness contains the promise of life, for time and eternity.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Faithful is the Word, and everyone should accept him!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">For the sake of this ministry, we toil tirelessly and are criticized continually,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">simply because our hope is in the living God. He is the wonderful life-giver</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">of all the children of men, and even more so to those who believe.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Instruct and teach the people all that I&apos;ve taught you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">And don&apos;t be intimidated by those who are older than you; simply be the example they need to see by being faithful and true in all that you do. Speak the truth</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">and live a life of purity and authentic love as you remain strong in your faith.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">So until I come, be diligent in devouring the Word of God, be faithful in prayer, and in teaching the believers.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Don&apos;t minimize the powerful gift that operates in your life, for it was imparted to you by the laying on of hands of the elders and was activated through the prophecy they spoke over you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Make all of this your constant meditation and make it real with your life so everyone can see that you are moving forward.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Give careful attention to your spiritual life and every cherished truth you teach, for living what you preach will release salvation inside you and to all those who listen to you.</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="5">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Don&apos;t be harsh or verbally abusive to an older man;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">it is better to appeal to him as a father. And as you minister to the younger men it is best to encourage them as your dear brothers.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Honor the older women</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">as mothers, and the younger women, treat as your dear sisters with utmost purity.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">The church needs to honor and support the widows, especially those who are in dire need.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">But if they have children or grandchildren at home, then it is only proper to let them provide for the ones who raised them when they were children, for kindness begins at home and it pleases God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">For the true widow</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">is all alone and has placed her complete hope in God. She is Messiah&apos;s missionary</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">and will need the support of the church</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">as one who remains in prayer day and night.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">But the widow who serves only herself lives a life of self-indulgence and is wasting her life away.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Be sure to give clear instruction concerning these matters so that none of them will live with shame.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">For if a believer fails to provide for their own relatives when they are in need, they have compromised</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">their convictions of faith</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">and need to be corrected</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">, for they are living worse than the unbelievers.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">The widows who are worthy to be supported by the church should be at least sixty years old and not remarried.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">They should have a beautiful testimony of raising their families, practicing hospitality, encouraging other believers, comforting troubled ones,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">and have a reputation for doing good works.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">But you need not concern yourself with the younger widows, for some will depart from the Messiah because of their desire to remarry.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">For they will face their own punishment</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">of living with a disturbed conscience for invalidating their former faith.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Those widows who go around from house to house as busybodies</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">are only learning to be lazy, making their situation even worse by talking too much, gossiping, and speaking things they shouldn&apos;t. They become far too obsessed with empty things that will not bear good fruit.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">For this reason, teach the younger women to remarry and bear children and care for their household. This will keep them from giving our adversary a reason to gloat.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">For there are already those who have begun to turn aside from their faith and are influenced by Satan.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">So if any believer has a widow in their family, instruct them to support her financially so that the church will not be burdened with her care. This will leave finances available for those widows who are truly in need.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">The pastors</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">who lead the church well should be paid well. They should receive double honor for faithfully preaching and teaching the revelation of the Word of God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">For the Scriptures have taught us: &apos;Do not muzzle an ox or forbid it to eat while it grinds the grain.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">And also, &apos;The one who labors deserves his wages.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Refuse to listen to suspicious accusations against the pastors who lead the flock unless you have two or three witnesses</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">to confirm the accusations</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">But if indeed you find that they have sinned, bring correction to them before the congregation so that the rest of the people will respect you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Timothy, in the presence of God and our Lord Jesus Christ, and before the chosen messengers,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">I solemnly charge you to put into practice all these matters without bias, prejudice, or favoritism.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Don&apos;t be hasty to ordain them with the laying on of hands, or you may end up sharing in their guilt should they fall. Keep yourself pure and holy with your standards high.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">(If drinking the water causes you to have stomach ailments,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">drink some wine instead.)</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">The sins of some people stand out and are well known. Yet there are others whose sins are not as obvious, but the truth of who they really are will eventually be seen and will bring them judgment.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">It is the same way with good works, even if they are not known at first, they will eventually be recognized and acknowledged.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="6">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Instruct every employee</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">to respect and honor their employers,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">for this attitude presents to them a clear testimony of God&apos;s truth and renown. Tell them to never provide them with a reason to discredit God&apos;s name because of their actions.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Especially honor and respect employers who are believers and don&apos;t despise them, but serve them even more, for they are fellow believers. They should be at peace with them as beloved members of God&apos;s family. Be faithful to teach them these things as their sacred obligation.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">But if anyone spreads false teaching that does not agree with the healthy instruction of our Lord Jesus, teaching others that holy awe of God</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">is not important, then they prove they know nothing at all! It&apos;s obvious they don&apos;t value or hold dear the healing words of our Lord Jesus Christ.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">They are covered with the clouds of conceit. They are loaded</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">with controversy, and they love to argue their opinions and split hairs. The fruit of their ministry is contention, competition, and evil suspicions.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">They add misery to many lives by corrupting their minds and cheating them of the truth. They equate the worship of God with making great sums of money.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">We have a &apos;profit&apos; that is greater than theirs&apos;our holy awe of God! To have merely our necessities is to have enough.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Isn&apos;t it true that our hands were empty when we came into the world, and when we leave this world our hands will be empty again?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Because of this, food and clothing is enough to make us content.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">But those who crave the wealth of this world slip into spiritual snares. They become trapped by the troubles that come through their foolish and harmful desires, driven by greed and drowning in their own sinful pleasures. And they take others down with them into their corruption and eventual destruction.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Loving money</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">is a root of all evils. Some people run after it so much that they have given up their faith. Craving more money pushes them away from the faith into error, compounding misery in their lives!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Timothy, you are God&apos;s man, so run from all these errors. Instead, chase after true holiness, justice, faithfulness, love, hope,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">and tender humility.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">So fight with faith for the winner&apos;s prize! Lay your hands upon eternal life, to which you were called and about which you made the good confession before the multitude of witnesses!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">So now, I instruct you before the God of resurrection life</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">and before Jesus, the Anointed One, who demonstrated a beautiful testimony even before Pontius Pilate,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">that you follow this commission faithfully with a clear conscience</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">and without blemish until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Yes, God will make his appearing in his own divine timing,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">for he is the exalted God, the only powerful One, the King over every king, and the Lord of power!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">He alone is the immortal God,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">living in the unapproachable light of divine glory! No one has ever seen his fullness, nor can they, for all the glory and endless authority of the universe belongs to him, forever and ever. Amen!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">To all the rich of this world, I command you not to be wrapped in thoughts of pride over your prosperity, or rely on your wealth, for your riches are unreliable and nothing compared to the living God. Trust instead in the one who lavishes upon us all good things, fulfilling our every need.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Remind the wealthy to be rich in remarkable works of extravagant generosity, willing to share with others.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">These spiritual investments will provide a beautiful foundation for their lives and secure for them a great future, as they lay their hands upon the meaning of true life.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">So, my son Timothy,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">don&apos;t forget all that has been deposited within you. Escape from the empty echoes of men</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">and the perversion of twisted reasoning.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">For those who claim to possess this so-called knowledge have already wandered from the true faith. May God&apos;s grace empower you always! Love in Christ , Paul</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="3">You know that I&apos;ve been called to serve the God of my fathers with a clean conscience. Night and day I pray constantly for you, building a memorial for you with my prayers.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">I know that you have wept for me, your spiritual father, and your tears are dear to me. I can&apos;t wait to see you again! I&apos;m filled with joy</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="6">I&apos;m writing to encourage you to fan into a flame and rekindle</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="9">He gave us resurrection life</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">and drew us to himself by his holy calling on our lives. And it wasn&apos;t because of any good we have done, but by his divine pleasure and marvelous grace that confirmed our union with the anointed Jesus, even before time began!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">This truth is now being unveiled by the revelation of the anointed Jesus, our life-giver, who has dismantled death,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">obliterating all its effects on our lives</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">, and has manifested his immortal life in us by the gospel.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">And he has anointed</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="12">The confidence of my calling enables me to overcome every difficulty without shame, for I have an intimate revelation of this God. And my faith in him convinces me that he is more than able to keep all that I&apos;ve placed in his hands</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="13">Allow the healing words you&apos;ve heard from me to live in you and make them a model for life as your faith and love for the Anointed One</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1">From Paul, God&apos;s willing slave</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1">to Titus</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">I&apos;m writing to you to further the faith</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">of God&apos;s chosen ones and lead them to the full knowledge of the truth that leads to godliness,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">which rests on the hope of eternal life. God, who never lies,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">has promised this before time began.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">In his own time he unveiled his word through the preaching</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">of the gospel</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">, which was entrusted to me by the command of God our Life Giver.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Titus, you are my true son in the faith we share. May grace and peace descend to you from God the Father and our Savior, the Anointed One, Jesus!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">The reason I stationed you in Crete</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">was so that you could set things in order and complete what was left unfinished,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">and</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">to raise up and</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="5">church</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">elders</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">in every city, just as I had instructed you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Each of them must be above reproach, devoted solely to his wife,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">whose children are believers and not rebellious or out of control.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">The overseer, since he serves God&apos;s household,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">must be someone of blameless character and not be opinionated or short-tempered. He must not be a drunkard or violent or greedy.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Instead he should be one who is known for his hospitality and a lover of goodness.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">He should be recognized as one who is fair-minded, pure-hearted, and self-controlled.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">He must have a firm grasp of the trustworthy message that he has been taught. This will enable him to both encourage others with healthy teachings and provide convincing answers to those who oppose his message.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">There are many wayward people, smooth talkers, and deceivers&apos;especially the converts from Judaism.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">They must be silenced</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">because they are disrupting entire families with their corrupt teachings, all for their dishonest greed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">A certain one of them, one of their own prophets,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">said, &apos;Those Cretans are nothing but liars, worthless beasts, and lazy gluttons.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">He certainly knew what he was talking about! For this reason, correct them thoroughly so that their lives will line up with the truths of our faith.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Instruct them not to pay any attention to Jewish myths or follow the teachings of those who reject the truth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">It&apos;s true that</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">all is pure to those who have pure hearts, but to the corrupt unbelievers nothing is pure. Their minds and consciences are defiled.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">They claim to know God, but by their actions they deny him. They are disgusting, disobedient, and disqualified from doing anything good.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="2">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Your duty is to teach them to embrace a lifestyle that is consistent with sound doctrine.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Lead the male elders</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">into disciplined lives full of dignity and self-control. Urge them to have a solid faith, generous love, and patient endurance.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Likewise with the female elders,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">lead them into lives free from gossip and drunkenness and to be teachers of beautiful things.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">This will enable them to teach the younger women</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">to love their husbands, to love their children,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">and to be self-controlled and pure, taking care of their household and being devoted to</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">their husbands. By doing these things the word of God will not be discredited.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Likewise, guide the younger men into living disciplined lives</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="6">.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Above all, set yourself apart as a model of a life nobly lived. With dignity, demonstrate integrity in all that you teach.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Bring a clear, wholesome message</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">that cannot be condemned, and then your critics will be embarrassed, with nothing bad to say about us.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Servants</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">are to be supportive of</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">their masters and do what is pleasing in every way. They are not to be argumentative</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">nor steal</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">but prove themselves to be completely loyal and trustworthy. By doing this they will advertise</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">through all that they do the beautiful teachings of God our Savior.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">God&apos;s marvelous grace</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">has manifested</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">in person</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">, bringing salvation for everyone.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">This same grace teaches us how to live each day as we turn our backs on ungodliness and indulgent lifestyles,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">and it equips us to live self-controlled, upright, godly lives in this present age.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">For we continue to wait for the fulfillment of our hope in the dawning splendor</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">of the glory of our great God and Savior, Jesus, the Anointed One.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">He sacrificed himself for us that he might purchase our freedom from every lawless deed and to purify for himself a people who are his very own,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">passionate to do what is beautiful in his eyes.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">So preach these truths and exhort others to follow them. Be willing to expose sin in order to bring correction with full authority,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">without being intimidated</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">by anyone.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="3">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Remind people to respect</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">their governmental leaders on every level as law-abiding citizens and to be ready to fulfill their civic duty.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">And remind them</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">to never tear down anyone with their words or quarrel,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">but instead be considerate, humble, and courteous to everyone.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">For it wasn&apos;t that long ago that we behaved foolishly in our stubborn disobedience. We were easily led astray as slaves to worldly passions and pleasures. We wasted our lives in doing evil, and with hateful jealousy we hated others.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">When the extraordinary compassion of God our Savior and his overpowering love suddenly appeared in person , as the brightness of a dawning day ,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">he came to save us. Not because of any virtuous deed that we have done but only because of his extravagant mercy.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">He saved us, resurrecting us through the washing of rebirth. We are made completely new by the Holy Spirit, whom he splashed over us richly by Jesus, the Messiah, our Life Giver.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">So as a gift of his love, and since we are faultless&apos; innocent before his face&apos; we can now become heirs of all things , all because of an overflowing hope of eternal life.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">How true and faithful is this message! I want you to especially emphasize these truths, so that those who believe in God will be careful to devote themselves to doing good works. It is always beautiful and profitable for believers to do good works.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">But avoid useless controversies,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">genealogies,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">pointless quarrels, and arguments over the law, which will get you nowhere.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">After a first and second warning, have nothing more to do with a divisive person</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">who refuses to be corrected</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">For you know that such a one is entwined with his sin and stands self-condemned.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">When I send Artemas</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">or Tychicus</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">to you, be sure to meet me at the City of Victory,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">for I&apos;ve decided to spend the winter there.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="7">Your love</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="13">I would have preferred to keep him at my side so that he could take your place as my helper during my imprisonment for the sake of the gospel.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">However, I did not want to make this decision without your consent, so that your act of kindness</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="15">Perhaps</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">you could think of it this way</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="16">So welcome him no longer as a slave, but more than that, as a dearly loved brother. He is that to me especially, and how much more so to you, both humanly speaking and in the Lord.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">So if you consider me your friend and partner, accept him the same way you would accept me.</VERS>

	<BIBLEBOOK bnumber="58" bname="Hebrews">
		<CHAPTER cnumber="1">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Throughout our history God has spoken to our ancestors by his prophets in many different ways. The revelation he gave them was only a fragment at a time,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">building one truth upon another</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">But to us living in these last days,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">God now speaks to us openly in the language of a Son,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">the appointed Heir of everything, for through him God created the panorama of all things and all time.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">The Son is the dazzling radiance of God&apos;s splendor,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">the exact expression of God&apos;s true nature&apos;his mirror image!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">He holds the universe</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">together and expands it</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">by the mighty power of his spoken word.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">He accomplished for us the complete cleansing of sins,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">and then took his seat on the highest throne at the right hand</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">of the majestic One.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">He is infinitely greater than angels, for he inherited a rank and a Name</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">far greater than theirs.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">For God has never said to any angel what he said to Jesus: &apos;You are my favored Son, today I have fathered you.&apos; And this: &apos;I will be the Father to him, and he will be the Son to me.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">And again, when he brought his firstborn Son into the world: &apos;Let all my angels bow down before him and kiss him in worship.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">And about his angels he says, &apos;I make my angels swift winds, and my ministers fiery flames.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">But about his Son, he called him &apos;God,&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">saying, &apos;Your throne, O God, endures forever and ever and you will rule your kingdom with justice and righteousness,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">For you have cherished righteousness and detested lawlessness. For this reason, God, your God, has anointed you and poured out the oil of bliss on you more than on any of your friends.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">And he called him Lord,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">saying, &apos;Lord, you formed the earth in the beginning and with your own hands you crafted the cosmos.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">They will both one day disappear, but you will remain forever! They will all fade like a worn-out garment,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">And they will be changed like clothes, and you will fold them up and put them away. But you are &apos;I AM.&apos; You never change, years without end!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">And God has never said this to any of his angels: &apos;Take your seat next to me at my right hand until I force your whispering enemies to be a rug under your feet.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">What role then, do the angels have? The angels are spirit-messengers sent by God to serve those who are going to be saved.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="2">
			<VERS vnumber="1">This is why it is so crucial that we be all the more engaged and attentive to the truths</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">that we have heard so that we do not drift off course.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">For if the message of the law spoken and confirmed by angels</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">brought a just penalty to every disobedient violation;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">then how would we expect to escape</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">punishment</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">if we despise the very truths that give us life?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">The Lord himself was the first to announce these things, and those who heard him firsthand confirmed their accuracy.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Then God added his witness to theirs. He validated their ministry with signs, astonishing wonders, all kinds of powerful miracles,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">and by</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">the gifts of</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">the Holy Spirit,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">which he distributed as he desired.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">For God will not place the coming world, of which we speak, under the government of angels.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">But the Scriptures affirm: What is man that you would even think about him, or care about Adam&apos;s race.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">You made him lower than the angels for a little while. You placed your glory and honor upon his head as a crown. And you have given him dominion over the works of your hands,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">For you have placed everything under his authority. This means that God has left nothing outside the control of his Son, even if presently we have yet to see this accomplished.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">But we see Jesus,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">who as a man</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">, lived for a short time lower than the angels and has now been crowned with glorious honor because of what he suffered in his death. For it was by God&apos;s grace</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">that he experienced death&apos;s bitterness on behalf of everyone!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">For now he towers above all creation, for all things exist through him and for him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">And that God made him, pioneer</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">of our salvation, perfect through his sufferings, for this is how he brings many sons and daughters to share in his glory.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Jesus, the Holy One, makes us holy. And as sons and daughters, we now belong to his same Father,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">so he is not ashamed or embarrassed to introduce us as his brothers and sisters!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">For he has said, &apos;I will reveal who you really are to my brothers and sisters, and I will glorify you with praises in the midst of the congregation.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">And, &apos;My confidence rests in God!&apos; And again he says, &apos;Here I am, one with the children Yahweh has given me.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Since all his &apos;children&apos; have flesh and blood, so Jesus became human to fully identify with us. He did this, so that he could experience death and annihilate the effects of the intimidating accuser who holds against us the power</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">of death.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">By embracing death Jesus sets free those who live their entire lives in bondage</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">to the tormenting dread of death.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">For it is clear that he didn&apos;t do this for the angels, but for all the sons and daughters of Abraham.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">This is why he had to be a man and take hold of our humanity in every way. He made us his brothers and sisters and became our merciful and faithful King-Priest</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">before God; as the One who removed our sins to make us one with him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">He suffered and endured every test and temptation, so that he can help us every time we pass through the ordeals of life.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="3">
			<VERS vnumber="1">And so, dear brothers and sisters, you are now made holy, and each of you is invited to the feast</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">of your heavenly calling.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">So fasten your thoughts fully onto Jesus,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">whom we embrace</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">as our Apostle and King-Priest.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">For he was faithful to the Father who appointed him, in the same way that Moses was a model of faithfulness in what was entrusted to him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">But Jesus is worthy to receive a much greater glory than Moses, for the one who builds a house deserves to be honored more than the house he builds.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Every house is built by someone, but God is the Designer and Builder of all things.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Indeed, Moses served God faithfully in all he gave him to do.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">His work prophetically illustrates</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">things that would later be spoken and fulfilled.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">But Christ is more than a Servant, he was faithful as the Son in charge of God&apos;s house. And now we are part of his house if we continue courageously to hold firmly to our bold confidence and our victorious hope.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">This is why the Holy Spirit says, &apos;If only you would listen to his voice this day!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Don&apos;t make him</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">angry by hardening your hearts, like your ancestors did during the days of their rebellion, when they were tested in the wilderness.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">There your fathers tested me and tried my patience even though they saw my miracles for forty years they still doubted me !</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">This ignited my anger with that generation and I said about them, &apos;They wander in their hearts just like they do with their feet, and they refuse to learn my ways.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">My heart grieved</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">over them so I decreed: &apos;They will not enter into my rest!&apos; &apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">So search your hearts every day,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">my brothers and sisters, and make sure that none of you has evil or unbelief hiding within you. For it will lead you astray,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">and make you unresponsive to the living God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">This is the time to encourage</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">each other to never be stubborn or hardened by sin&apos;s deceitfulness.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">For we are mingled with the Messiah,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">if we will continue unshaken in this confident assurance</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">from the beginning until the end.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">For again, the Scriptures say, If only today you would listen to his voice. Don&apos;t make him angry by hardening your hearts, as you did in the wilderness rebellion.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">The same people who were delivered from bondage and brought out of Egypt by Moses, were the ones who heard and still rebelled.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">They grieved God for forty years</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">by sinning in their unbelief, until they dropped dead in the desert.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">So God swore an oath that they would never enter into his calming place of rest all because they disobeyed him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">It is clear that they could not enter</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">into their inheritance</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">because they wrapped their hearts in unbelief.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="4">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Now the promise of entering into God&apos;s rest is still for us today. So we must be extremely careful to ensure that we all embrace the fullness of that promise and not fail to experience it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">For we have heard the good news of deliverance just as they did, yet they didn&apos;t join their faith with the Word.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Instead, what they heard didn&apos;t affect them deeply, for they doubted.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">For those of us who believe, faith activates the promise and we experience the realm of confident rest! For he has said, &apos;I was grieved with them and made a solemn oath, &apos;They will not enter into my rest.&apos; &apos; God&apos;s works have all been completed from the foundation of the world,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">for it says in the Scriptures, And on the seventh day God rested from all his works.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">And again, as stated before, They will not enter into my rest.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Those who first heard the good news of deliverance failed to enter into that realm of faith&apos;s rest because of their unbelieving hearts. Yet the fact remains that we still have the opportunity to enter into the faith-rest life and experience the fulfillment of the promise!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">For God still has ordained a day for us to enter into called &apos;Today.&apos; For it was long afterwards that God repeated it in David&apos;s words, &apos;If only today you would listen to his voice and do not harden your hearts!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Now if this promise of &apos;rest&apos; was fulfilled when Joshua brought the people into the land,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">God wouldn&apos;t have spoken later of another &apos;rest&apos; yet to come.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">So we conclude that there is still a full and complete Sabbath-rest</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">waiting for believers</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">to experience.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">As we enter into God&apos;s faith-rest life we cease from our own works, just as God</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">celebrates his finished works and</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">rests in them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">So then we must be eager to experience this faith-rest life, so that no one falls short by following the same pattern of doubt and unbelief.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">For we have the living Word of God, which is full of energy,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">like a two-mouthed sword.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">It will even penetrate to the very core of our being where soul and spirit, bone</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">and marrow meet!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">It interprets and reveals the true thoughts and secret motives of our hearts.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">There is not one person who can hide their thoughts from God, for nothing that we do remains a secret, and nothing created is concealed, but everything is exposed and defenseless before his eyes, to whom we must render an account.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">So then, we must cling in faith to all we know to be true. For we have a magnificent King-Priest,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Jesus Christ, the Son of God, who rose into the heavenly realm for us, and now sympathizes with us in our frailty.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">He understands humanity, for as a man, our magnificent King-Priest was tempted in every way just as we are, and conquered sin.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">So now we draw near freely and boldly to where grace is enthroned,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">to receive mercy&apos;s kiss and discover the grace we urgently need to strengthen</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">us in our time of weakness.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="5">
			<VERS vnumber="1">For every High Priest was chosen from among the people and appointed to represent them before God by presenting their gifts to God and offering sacrifices on their behalf.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Since the High Priest is also one who is clothed in weakness, he humbles himself</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">by showing compassion to those who are ignorant of God&apos;s ways and stray from them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">And for this reason, he has to not only present the sin offerings of others, but also to bring a sin offering for himself.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">And no one takes this honor upon himself by being self-appointed, but God is the one who calls each one, just as Aaron was called.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">So also, Christ was not self-appointed and did not glorify himself by becoming a high priest, but God called and glorified him!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">For the Father said to him, &apos;You are my favored Son. Today I have fathered you.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">And in another Scripture he says about this new priestly order, &apos;You are a Priest like Melchizedek, a King-Priest forever!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">During Christ&apos;s days on earth</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">he pleaded with God, praying with passion and with tearful agony that God would spare him from death.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">And because of his perfect devotion his prayer was answered and he was delivered.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">But even though he was a wonderful Son,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">he learned to listen</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">and obey through all his sufferings.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">And after being proven perfect in this way he has now become the source of eternal salvation to all those who listen to him and obey.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">For God has designated him as the King-Priest who is over the priestly order of Melchizedek.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">We have much to say about this topic although it is difficult to explain,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">because you have become too dull and sluggish to understand.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">For you should already be professors instructing others by now; but instead, you need to be taught from the beginning the basics of God&apos;s prophetic oracles!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">You&apos;re like children</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">still needing milk and not yet ready to digest solid food.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">For every spiritual infant who lives on milk is not yet pierced</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">by the revelation of righteousness.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">But solid food is for the mature, whose spiritual senses perceive</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">heavenly matters</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">. And they have been adequately trained by what they&apos;ve experienced to emerge</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">with understanding of the difference between what is truly excellent and what is evil and harmful.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="6">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Now is the time for us to progress beyond the basic message of Christ</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">and advance into perfection. The foundation has already been laid for us to build upon: turning away from our dead works</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">to embrace faith in God,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">teaching about different baptisms,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">impartation by the laying on of hands,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">resurrection of the dead, and eternal judgment.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">So with God&apos;s enablement</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">we will move on to deeper truths.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">It is impossible to restore an apostate.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">For once a person has come into God&apos;s light, and tasted the gifts of the heavenly realm, and has received the Holy Spirit,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">and feasted on the good Word of God, and has entered into the power of the age that is breaking in,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">if he abandons his faith, there is no use even trying to lead him to repentance. By their sin of apostasy</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">they re-crucify the Son of God,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">and have publicly repudiated him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">For men&apos;s hearts</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">are just like the soil that drinks up the showers which often fall upon it. Some soil will yield crops as God&apos;s blessing upon the field.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">But if the field continues to produce only thorns and thistles</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">a curse hangs over it and it will be burned.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Even though we speak like this, beloved, we are fully convinced that there are more beautiful and excellent things, which flow from your salvation.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">For God, the Faithful One, is not unfair.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">How can he forget</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">the</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">beautiful</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">work you have done for him? He remembers the love you demonstrate as you continually serve</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">his beloved ones</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">for the glory of his name.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">But we long to see you passionately advance until the end and you find your hope fulfilled.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">So don&apos;t allow your hearts to grow dull</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">or lose your enthusiasm, but follow the example of those who fully received what God has promised</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">because of their strong faith and patient endurance.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Now when God made a promise to Abraham, since there was no one greater than himself, he swore an oath on his own integrity</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">to keep the promise as sure as God exists!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">So he said, &apos;Have no doubt, I promise to bless you over and over, and give you a son and multiply you without measure!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">So Abraham waited patiently in faith and succeeded in seeing the promise fulfilled.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">It is very common for people to swear an oath by something greater than themselves, for the oath will confirm their statements and end all dispute.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">So in the same way, God wanted to end all doubt and confirm it even more forcefully to those who would inherit his promises. His purpose was unchangeable, so God added his vow to the promise.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">So it is impossible for God to lie for we know that his promise and his vow will never change! And now we have run into his heart to hide ourselves in his faithfulness. This is where we find his strength and comfort, for he empowers us to seize what has already been established ahead of time&apos;an unshakable hope!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">We have this certain hope like a strong, unbreakable anchor holding our souls to God himself. Our anchor of hope is fastened</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">to the mercy seat</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">in the heavenly realm beyond the sacred threshold,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">and where Jesus, our forerunner,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">has gone in before us. He is now and forever our royal Priest like Melchizedek.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="7">
			<VERS vnumber="3">This Melchizedek has no father or mother, and no record of any of his ancestors. He was never born and he never died, but his life is like a picture</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">of the Son of God, a King-Priest forever!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Now let me show you proof of how great this Melchizedek is: &apos; Even though Abraham was the most honored and favored patriarch of all God&apos;s chosen ones, he gave a tithe of the spoils of battle to Melchizedek.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">It would be understandable if Melchizedek had been a Jewish priest, for later on God&apos;s people were required by law to support their priests financially, because the priests were their relatives and Abraham&apos;s descendants.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">But Melchizedek was not Abraham&apos;s Jewish relative,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">and yet Abraham still paid him a tithe. &apos; Melchizedek imparted a blessing on mighty Abraham, who had received the promises of God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">And no one could deny the fact that the one who has the power to impart a blessing is superior to the one who receives it. &apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Although the Jewish priests received tithes, they all died&apos;they were mortal. But Melchizedek lives on! &apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">It could even be said that Levi, the ancestor of every Jewish priest who received tithes, actually paid tithes to Melchizedek through Abraham.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">For although Levi was yet unborn, the seed from which Levi came was present in Abraham</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">when he paid his tithe to Melchizedek. &apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">If any of the Levitical priests who served under the law had the power to bring us into perfection, then why did God send Christ as Priest after the likeness of Melchizedek? He should have said, &apos;After the likeness of Aaron.&apos; &apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">And furthermore, for God to send a new and different rank of priest, meant a new law would have had to be instituted even to allow it!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Yet the One these things all point to, was from a different tribe and no one from that tribe ever officiated at God&apos;s altar,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">for we all know that our Lord didn&apos;t descend from the tribe of Levi, but shined from the tribe of Judah.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">And Moses himself never said anything of a priest in connection with Judah&apos;s tribe.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">And all this is made even clearer if there was another King-Priest raised up with the rank of Melchizedek.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">This King-Priest did not arise because of a genealogical right under the law to be a priest, but by the power of an indestructible,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">resurrection</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">life!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">For it says in the Psalms, You are like Melchizedek, a King-Priest forever!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">The old</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">order of priesthood</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">has been set aside as weak and powerless.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">For the law</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">has never made anyone perfect, but in its place is a far better hope which gives us confidence to experience intimacy with God!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">And he confirmed it to us with his solemn vow.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">For the former priests took their office without an oath,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">but with Jesus, God affirmed his royal-priesthood with his promise, saying, The Lord has made a solemn oath and will never change his mind, &apos;You are a King-Priest forever!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">So all of this magnifies the truth that we have a superior covenant with God than what they experienced, for Jesus himself is its guarantor!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">As additional proof, we know there were many priests under the old system, for they eventually died and their office had to be filled by another.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">But Jesus permanently holds his priestly office, since he lives forever and will never have a successor!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">So he is able to save fully from now throughout eternity,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">everyone who comes to God through him, because he lives to pray continually for them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">He is the High Priest who perfectly fits our need&apos;holy, without a trace of evil, without the ability to deceive, incapable of sin,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">and exalted beyond the heavens!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">Unlike the former high priests, he is not compelled to offer daily sacrifices. They had to bring a sacrifice first for their own sins,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">then for the sins of the people, but he finished the sacrificial system, once and for all, when he offered himself.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">The law appointed flawed men as high priests, but God&apos;s promise, sealed with his oath, which succeeded the law, appoints a perfect Son who is complete forever!</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="8">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Now this is the crowning point of what we are saying: We have a magnificent King-Priest who ministers for us at the right hand of God. He is enthroned with honor next to the throne of the Majesty on high.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">He serves in the holy sanctuary in the true heavenly tabernacle</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">set up by God, and not by men.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Since every high priest is appointed to offer both gifts and sacrifices, so the Messiah also had to bring some sacrifice.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">But since he didn&apos;t qualify to be an earthly priest, and there are already priests who offer sacrifices</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">prescribed by the law,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">he offered in heaven a perfect sacrifice</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">The priests on earth serve in a temple that is but a copy modeled after the heavenly sanctuary; a shadow of the reality. For when Moses began to construct the tabernacle God warned him and said, &apos;You must precisely follow the pattern I revealed to you on Mount Sinai.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">But now Jesus the Messiah</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">has accepted a priestly ministry which far surpasses theirs, since he is the catalyst</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">of a better covenant which contains far more wonderful promises!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">For if that first covenant had been faultless no one would have needed a second one to replace it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">But God revealed the defect and limitation of the first when he said to his people, &apos;Look! The day will come, declares the Lord, when I will satisfy the people of Israel and Judah by giving them a new covenant.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">It will be an entirely different covenant than the one I made with their fathers when I led them by my hand out of Egypt. For they did not remain faithful to my covenant, so I rejected them, says the Lord God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">For here is the covenant I will one day establish with the people of Israel: I will embed my laws within their thoughts and fasten them onto their hearts. I will be their loyal God and they will be my loyal people.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">And the result of this will be that everyone will know me as Lord! There will be no need at all to teach their fellow-citizens or brothers by saying, &apos;You should know Yahweh,&apos; since everyone will know me inwardly , from the most unlikely to the most distinguished.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">For I will demonstrate my mercy to them and will forgive their evil deeds, and never remember again their sins.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">This proves that by establishing this new covenant the first is now obsolete, ready to expire, and about to disappear.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="9">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Now in the first covenant there were specific rules for worship including a sanctuary on earth to worship in.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">When you entered the tabernacle you would first come into the holy chamber where you would find the lampstand</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">and the bread of his presence on the fellowship table.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Then as you pass through the next curtain</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">you would enter the innermost chamber called, the holiest sanctuary of all.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">It contained the golden altar of incense and the ark of covenant mercy, which was a wooden box covered entirely with gold. And placed inside the ark of covenant mercy was the golden jar with mystery-manna inside,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Aaron&apos;s resurrection rod, which had sprouted, and the stone tablets engraved with the covenant laws.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">On top of the lid of the ark were two cherubim, angels of splendor, with outstretched wings overshadowing the throne of mercy.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">But now is not the time to discuss further the significant details of these things.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">So with this prescribed pattern of worship the priests would routinely go in and out of the first chamber to perform their religious duties.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">And the high priest was permitted to enter into the Holiest Sanctuary of All only once a year and he could never enter without first offering sacrificial blood for both his own sins and for the sins of the people.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Now the Holy Spirit uses the symbols of this pattern of worship to reveal that the perfect way of holiness</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">had not yet been unveiled. For as long as the tabernacle stood</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">it was an illustration</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">that pointed to our present time of fulfillment</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">, demonstrating that offerings and animal sacrifices had failed to perfectly cleanse the conscience of the worshiper.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">For this old pattern of worship was a matter of external rules and rituals concerning food and drink and ceremonial washings which was imposed upon us until the appointed time of heart-restoration had arrived.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">But now the Anointed One has become the King-Priest of every wonderful thing that has come.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">For he serves in a greater, more perfect heavenly tabernacle not made by men, that is to say, not a part of this creation.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">And he has entered once and forever into the Holiest Sanctuary of All, not with the blood of animal sacrifices, but the sacred blood of his own sacrifice. And he alone has made our salvation</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">secure forever!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Under the old covenant the blood of bulls, goats, and the ashes of a heifer were sprinkled on those who were defiled and effectively cleansed them outwardly from their ceremonial impurities.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Yet how much more will the sacred blood of the Messiah thoroughly cleanse our consciences! For by the power of the eternal Spirit he has offered himself to God as the perfect</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Sacrifice that now frees</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">us from our dead works</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">to worship and serve the living God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">So Jesus is the One who has enacted a new covenant with a new relationship with God so that those who accept the invitation</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">will receive the eternal inheritance he has promised to his heirs. For he died to release us from the guilt of the violations committed under the first covenant.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">So this is why not even the first covenant was inaugurated without the blood of animals.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">For Moses ratified the covenant after he gave the people all the commandments of the law. He took the blood of calves and goats, with water, scarlet wool, and a hyssop branch, and sprinkled both the people and the book of the covenant,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">saying, &apos;This is the blood of the covenant that God commands you to keep.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">And later Moses also sprinkled the tabernacle with blood and every utensil and item used in their service of worship.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Actually, nearly everything under the law was purified with blood, since forgiveness only comes through an outpouring of blood.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">And so it was necessary for all the earthly symbols</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">of the heavenly realities to be purified with these animal sacrifices, but the heavenly things themselves required a superior sacrifice than these.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">For the Messiah did not enter into the earthly tabernacle made by men, which was but an echo of the true sanctuary, but he entered into heaven itself to appear before the face</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">of God in our place.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">Under the old system year after year the high priest entered the most holy sanctuary with blood that was not his own. But the Messiah did not need to repeatedly offer himself year after year,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">for that would mean he must suffer repeatedly ever since the fall of the world.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">But now he has appeared at the fulfillment of the ages to abolish</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">sin once and for all by the sacrifice of himself!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">Every human being is appointed to die once, and then to face God&apos;s judgment.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">But when we die we will be face-to-face with Christ</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">, the One who experienced death once for all to bear the sins of many!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">And now to those who eagerly await him, he will appear a second time; not to deal with sin, but to bring us the fullness of salvation.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="10">
			<VERS vnumber="1">The old system of living under the law presented us with only a faint shadow, a crude outline of the reality of the wonderful blessings to come. Even with its steady stream of sacrifices offered year after year, there still was nothing that could make our hearts perfect before God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">For what power does the blood of bulls and goats</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">have to remove sin&apos;s guilt?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">So when Jesus the Messiah came into the world he said, &apos;Since your ultimate desire was not another animal sacrifice, you have clothed me with a body that I might offer myself instead!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Multiple burnt offerings and sin-offerings cannot satisfy your justice.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">So I said to you, &apos;God&apos; I will be the One to go and do your will, to fulfill all that is written of me in your Word!&apos; &apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">First he said,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">&apos;Multiple burnt-offerings and sin-offerings cannot satisfy your justice&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">(even though the law required them to be offered).</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">And then he said,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">&apos;God, I will be the One to go and do your will.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">So by being the sacrifice that removes sin</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">, he abolishes animal sacrifices</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">and replaces that entire system with the new covenant.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">By God&apos;s will we have been purified and made holy once and for all</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">through the sacrifice of the body of Jesus, the Messiah!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Yet every day priests still serve, ritually offering the same sacrifices again and again&apos;sacrifices that can never take away sin&apos;s guilt.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">But when this Priest had offered the one supreme sacrifice for sin for all time he sat down on a throne at the right hand of God,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">waiting until all his whispering enemies are subdued and turn into his footstool.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">And by his one perfect sacrifice he made us perfectly holy</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">and complete for all time!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">The Holy Spirit confirms this to us by this Scripture, for the Lord says,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">&apos;Afterwards, I will give them this covenant: I will embed my laws into their hearts and fasten my Word to their thoughts.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">And then he says, &apos;I will not ever again remember their sins and lawless deeds!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">So if our sins have been forgiven and forgotten, why would we ever need to offer another sacrifice for sin?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">And now we are brothers and sisters in God&apos;s family because of the blood of Jesus, and he welcomes us to come into the most holy sanctuary in the heavenly realm&apos;boldly and without hesitation.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">For he has dedicated a new,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">life-giving way for us to approach God. For just as the veil was torn in two, Jesus&apos; body was torn open to give us free and fresh access to him!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">And since we now have a magnificent High Priest to welcome us into God&apos;s house,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">we come closer to God and approach him</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">with an open heart, fully convinced that nothing will keep us at a distance from him. For our hearts have been sprinkled with blood to remove impurity, and we have been freed from an accusing conscience. Now we are clean, unstained, and presentable to God inside and out!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">So now wrap your heart tightly around the hope that lives within us, knowing that God always keeps his promises!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">Discover creative ways to encourage others</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">and to motivate them toward acts of compassion, doing beautiful works as expressions of love.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">This is not the time to pull away and neglect</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">meeting together, as some have formed the habit of doing. In fact, we should come together even more frequently, eager to encourage and urge each other onward as we anticipate that day dawning.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">For if we continue to persist in deliberate sin after we have known and received the truth, there is not another sacrifice for sin to be made for us.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">But this would qualify one for the certain, terrifying expectation of judgment and the raging fire ready to burn up his enemies!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">Anyone who disobeyed Moses&apos; law died without mercy on the simple evidence of two or three witnesses.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">How much more severely do you suppose a person deserves to be judged who has contempt for God&apos;s Son,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">and who scorns the blood of the new covenant that made him holy, and has outraged the Spirit of grace?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">For we know him who said, &apos;I have the right to take revenge and pay them back for their evil!&apos; And also, &apos;The Lord God will judge his own people!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">It is the most terrifying thing of all to come under the judgment</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">of the Living God!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">Don&apos;t you remember those days right after the Light shined in your hearts?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">You endured a great marathon season of suffering hardships, yet you stood your ground.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">And at times you were publicly and shamefully mistreated, being persecuted for your faith;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">then at other times you stood side by side with those who preach the message of hope.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">You sympathized with those in prison</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">and when all your belongings were confiscated you accepted that violation with joy; convinced that you possess a treasure growing in heaven</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">that could never be taken from you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">So don&apos;t lose your bold, courageous faith, for you are destined for a great reward!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">You need the strength of endurance to reveal the poetry</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">of God&apos;s will and then you receive the promise in full.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">For soon and very soon, &apos;The One who is appearing will come without delay!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">And he also says, &apos;My righteous ones will live from my faith. But if fear holds them back, my soul is not content with them!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">But we are certainly not those who are held back by fear and perish; we are among those who have faith and experience true life!</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="11">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Now faith brings our hopes into reality and becomes the foundation needed to acquire the things we long for. It is all the evidence required to prove what is still unseen.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">This testimony of faith is what previous generations</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">were commended for.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Faith empowers us to see that the universe was created and beautifully coordinated</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">by the power of God&apos;s words! He spoke and the invisible realm gave birth to all that is seen.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Faith moved Abel</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">to choose a more acceptable sacrifice to offer God than his brother Cain, and God declared him righteous because of his offering of faith. By his faith, Abel still speaks instruction to us today, even though he is long dead.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Faith translated Enoch from this life and he was taken up into heaven! He never had to experience death; he just disappeared from this world because God promoted him. For before he was translated to the heavenly realm his life had become a pleasure to God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">And without faith living within us it would be impossible to please God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">For we come to God in faith</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">knowing that he is real and that he rewards the faith of those who passionately seek him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Faith opened Noah&apos;s heart to receive revelation and warnings from God about what was coming, even things that had never been seen. But he stepped out in reverent obedience to God and built an ark that would save him and his family. By his faith the world was condemned, but Noah received God&apos;s gift of righteousness that comes by believing.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Faith motivated Abraham to obey God&apos;s call and leave the familiar to discover the territory he was destined to inherit from God. So he left with only a promise and without even knowing ahead of time where he was going, Abraham stepped out in faith.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">He lived by faith as an immigrant in his promised land as though it belonged to someone else.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">He journeyed through the land living in tents with Isaac and Jacob who were persuaded that they were also co-heirs of the same promise.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">His eyes of faith were set on the city</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">with unshakable foundations, whose architect and builder is God himself.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Sarah&apos;s faith embraced</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">God&apos;s</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">miracle power to conceive even though she was barren and was past the age of childbearing, for the authority of her faith</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">rested in the One who made the promise, and she tapped into his faithfulness.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">In fact, so many children were subsequently fathered by this aged man of faith&apos;one who was as good as dead, that he now has offspring as innumerable as the sand on the seashore and as the stars in the sky!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">These heroes all died still clinging to their faith, not even receiving all that had been promised them. But they saw beyond the horizon the fulfillment of their promises and gladly embraced it from afar. They all lived their lives on earth as those who belonged to another realm.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">For clearly, those who live this way</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">are longing for the appearing of a heavenly city.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">And if their hearts were still remembering what they left behind, they would have found an opportunity to go back.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">But they couldn&apos;t turn back for their hearts were fixed on what was far greater, that is, the heavenly realm! So because of this God is not ashamed in any way to be called their God, for he has prepared a heavenly city for them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Faith operated powerfully in Abraham for when he was put to the test he offered up Isaac. Even though he received God&apos;s promises</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">of descendants, he was willing</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">to offer up his only son!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">For God had promised, &apos;Through your son Isaac your lineage will carry on your name.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Abraham&apos;s faith made it logical to him that God could raise Isaac from the dead, and symbolically,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">that&apos;s exactly what happened.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">The power of faith prompted Isaac to impart a blessing to his sons, Jacob and Esau, concerning their prophetic destinies.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Jacob worshiped in faith&apos;s reality at the end of his life, and leaning upon his staff he imparted a prophetic blessing upon each of Joseph&apos;s sons.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Faith inspired Joseph and opened his eyes to see into the future, for as he was dying he prophesied about the exodus</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">of Israel out of Egypt,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">and gave instructions that his bones were to be taken from Egypt with them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">Faith prompted the parents of Moses at his birth to hide him for three months,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">because they realized their child was exceptional</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">and</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">they</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">refused to be afraid of the king&apos;s edict.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">Faith enabled Moses to choose God&apos;s will, for although he was raised as the son of Pharaoh&apos;s daughter, he refused to make that his identity,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">choosing instead to suffer mistreatment with the people of God. Moses preferred faith&apos;s certainty above the momentary enjoyment of sin&apos;s pleasures.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">He found his true wealth in suffering abuse for being anointed,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">more than in anything the world could offer him,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">for his eyes looked with wonder not on the immediate, but on the ultimate&apos;faith&apos;s great reward!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">Holding faith&apos;s promise Moses abandoned Egypt and had no fear of Pharaoh&apos;s rage because he persisted in faith as if he had seen God who is unseen.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">Faith stirred Moses to perform the rite of Passover and sprinkle lamb&apos;s blood,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">to prevent the destroyer from harming their firstborn.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">Faith opened the way for the Hebrews to cross the Red Sea as if on dry land, but when the Egyptians tried to cross they were swallowed up and drowned!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30">Faith pulled down Jericho&apos;s walls after the people marched around them for seven days!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31">Faith provided a way of escape for Rahab the prostitute, avoiding the destruction of the unbelievers, because she received the Hebrew spies in peace.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32">And what more could I say to convince you? For there is not enough time to tell you of the faith of Gideon, Barak, Samson, Jephthah, David, Samuel, and the prophets.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33">Through faith&apos;s power they conquered kingdoms and established true justice. Their faith fastened onto their promises and pulled them into reality! It was faith that shut the mouth of lions,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">put out the power of raging fire, and caused many to escape certain death by the sword. Although weak, their faith imparted power to make them strong!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34">Faith sparked courage within them and they became mighty warriors in battle, pulling armies from another realm into battle array.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35">Faith-filled women saw their dead children raised in resurrection power. Yet it was faith that enabled others to endure great atrocities. They were stretched out on the wheel and tortured, and didn&apos;t deny their faith in order to be freed, because they longed for a more honorable and glorious resurrection!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36">Others were mocked and experienced the most severe beating with whips; they were in chains and imprisoned.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37">Some of these faith champions were brutally killed by stoning, being sawn in two or slaughtered by the sword. These lived in faith as they went about wearing goatskins and sheepskins for clothing. They lost everything they possessed, they endured great afflictions, and they were cruelly mistreated.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38">They wandered the earth living in the desert wilderness, in caves, on barren mountains and in holes in the earth. Truly, the world was not even worthy of them, not realizing who they were.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39">These were the true heroes, commended for their faith, yet they lived in hope without receiving the fullness of what was promised them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40">But now God has invited us to live in something better than what they had&apos;faith&apos;s fullness! This is so that they could be brought to finished perfection alongside of us.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="12">
			<VERS vnumber="1">As for us, we have all of these great witnesses</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">who encircle</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">us like clouds. So we must let go of every wound that has pierced us</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">and the sin we so easily fall into.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">Then we will be able to run life&apos;s marathon race</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">with passion and determination, for the path has been already marked out before us.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">We look away from the natural realm and we focus our attention</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">and expectation</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">onto Jesus who birthed faith within us and who leads us forward into faith&apos;s perfection.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">His example is this: Because his heart was focused on the joy of knowing that you would be his,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">he endured the agony of the cross and conquered its humiliation,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">and now sits exalted at the right hand of the throne of God!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">So consider carefully how Jesus faced such intense opposition from sinners who opposed their own souls,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">so that you won&apos;t become worn down and cave in under life&apos;s pressures.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">After all, you have not yet reached the point of sweating blood</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">in your opposition to sin.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">And have you forgotten his encouraging words spoken to you as his children? He said, &apos;My child, don&apos;t underestimate the value of the discipline and training of the Lord God, or get depressed when he has to correct you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">For the Lord&apos;s training of your life is the evidence of his faithful love. And when he draws you to himself, it proves you are his delightful child.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Fully embrace God&apos;s correction as part of your training,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">for he is doing what any loving father does for his children. For who has ever heard of a child who never had to be corrected?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">We all should welcome God&apos;s discipline as the validation of authentic sonship. For if we have never once endured his correction it only proves we are strangers</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">and not sons.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">And isn&apos;t it true that we respect our earthly fathers even though they corrected and disciplined us? Then we should demonstrate an even greater respect for God, our spiritual Father, as we submit to his life-giving discipline.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Our parents corrected us for the short time of our childhood as it seemed good to them. But God corrects us throughout our lives for our own good, giving us an invitation to share his holiness.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Now all discipline</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">seems to be painful at the time, yet later it will produce a transformation of character, bringing a harvest of righteousness and peace</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">to those who yield to it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">So be made strong even in your weakness by lifting up your tired hands</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">in prayer and worship</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">. And strengthen your weak knees,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">for as you keep walking forward on God&apos;s paths</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">all your stumbling ways will be divinely healed!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">In every relationship be swift to choose peace over competition,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">and run swiftly toward holiness, for those who are not holy will not see the Lord.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Watch over each other to make sure that no one misses the revelation of God&apos;s grace. And make sure no one lives with a root of bitterness</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">sprouting within them which will only cause trouble and poison the hearts of many.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Be careful that no one among you lives in immorality, becoming careless about God&apos;s blessings, like Esau who traded away his rights as the firstborn for a simple meal.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">And we know that later on when he wanted to inherit his father&apos;s blessing, he was turned away, even though he begged for it with bitter tears, for it was too late then to repent.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">For we are not coming,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">as Moses did</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">, to a physical mountain with its burning fire, thick clouds of darkness and gloom, and with a raging whirlwind.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">We are not those who are being warned by the jarring blast of a trumpet and the thundering voice;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">the fearful voice that they begged to be silenced.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">They couldn&apos;t handle God&apos;s command that said, &apos;If so much as an animal approaches the mountain it is to be stoned to death!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">The astounding phenomena Moses witnessed caused him to shudder with fear and he could only say, &apos;I am trembling in terror!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">By contrast, we have already come</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">near to God in a totally different realm, the Zion-realm,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">for we have entered the city of the Living God, which is the New Jerusalem in heaven!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">We have joined the festal gathering of myriads of angels</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">in their joyous celebration!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">And as members of the church</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">of the Firstborn</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">all our names have been legally registered</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">as citizens of heaven! And we have come before God who judges all, and who lives among the spirits of the righteous who have been made perfect in his eyes!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">And we have come to Jesus who established a new covenant with his blood sprinkled upon the mercy seat; blood that continues to speak from heaven, &apos;forgiveness,&apos; a better message than Abel&apos;s blood that cries from the earth, &apos;justice.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">Make very sure that you never refuse to listen to God when he speaks!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">For the God who spoke on earth from Sinai is the same God who now speaks from heaven. Those who heard him</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">speak his living Word on earth found nowhere to hide, so what chance is there for us to escape if we turn our backs on God and refuse to hear his warnings as he speaks from heaven?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">The earth was rocked at the sound of his voice from the mountain, but now he has promised, &apos;Once and for all I will not only shake the systems of the world, but also the unseen powers in the heavenly realm!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">Now this phrase &apos;once and for all&apos; clearly indicates the final removal of things that are shaking, that is, the old order,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">so only what is unshakable will remain.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">Since we are receiving</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">our rights</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">to</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">an unshakable kingdom</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">we should be extremely thankful and offer God the purest worship that delights his heart</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">as we lay down our lives in absolute surrender, filled with awe.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">For our God is a holy, devouring fire!</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="13">
			<VERS vnumber="1">No matter what, make room in your heart to love every believer.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">And show hospitality to strangers, for they may be angels from God showing up as your guests.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Identify with those who are in prison as though you were there suffering with them, and those who are mistreated as if you could feel their pain.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Honor the sanctity of marriage and keep your vows of purity to one another, for God will judge sexual immorality in any form, whether single or married.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Don&apos;t be obsessed with money but live content with what you have, for you always have God&apos;s presence. For hasn&apos;t he promised you, &apos;I will never leave you, never! And I will not loosen my grip on your life!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">So we can say with great confidence: &apos;I know the Lord is for me and I will never be afraid of what people may do to me!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Don&apos;t forget the example of your spiritual leaders who have spoken God&apos;s messages to you, take a close look at how their lives ended,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">and then follow their walk of faith.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Jesus, the Anointed One, is always the same&apos;yesterday, today, and forever.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">So don&apos;t let anyone lead you astray with all sorts of novel and exotic teachings. It is more beautiful to feast on grace and be inwardly strengthened than to be obsessed with dietary rules</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">which in themselves have no lasting benefit.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">We feast on a sacrifice at our spiritual altar, but those who serve as priests in the old system of worship have no right to eat of it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">For the high priest carries the blood of animals into the holiest chamber as a sacrifice for sin, and then burns the bodies of the animals outside the city.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">And Jesus, our sin-sacrifice, also suffered death outside the city walls to make us holy by his own blood.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">So we must arise and join him outside the religious &apos;walls&apos; and bear his disgrace.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">For we have no city here on earth to be our permanent home, but we seek the city that is destined to come.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">So we no longer offer up a steady stream of blood sacrifices, but through Jesus, we will offer up to God a steady stream of praise sacrifices&apos;these are &apos;the lambs&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">we offer from our lips that celebrate his name!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">We will show mercy to the poor</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">and not miss an opportunity to do acts of kindness for others, for these are the true sacrifices that delight God&apos;s heart.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Obey your spiritual leaders and recognize their authority, for they keep watch over your soul without resting</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">since they will have to give an account to God for their work. So it will benefit you when you make their work a pleasure and not a heavy burden.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">And keep praying for us that we continue to live with a clear conscience, for we desire to live honorably in all that we do.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">And I especially ask you to pray that God would send me back to you very soon.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Now may the God who brought us peace by raising from the dead our Lord Jesus Christ so that he would be the Great Shepherd of his flock; and by the power of the blood of the eternal covenant</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">may he work perfection into every part of you giving you all that you need to fulfill your destiny. And may he express through you all that is excellent and pleasing</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">to him through your life-union with Jesus the Anointed One who is to receive all glory forever! Amen!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">My dear brothers and sisters, I urge you to let your spirits flow through this message of love</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">that I&apos;ve written to you in these few words.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">I want you to know that our brother Timothy is free again and as soon as he arrives here we&apos;ll come together to see you. We extend our greetings to all your leaders and all the holy believers.</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="1">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Greetings!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">My name is Jacob,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">and I&apos;m a love-slave of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ. I&apos;m writing to all the twelve tribes of Israel who have been sown as seeds</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">among the nations.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">My fellow believers, when it seems as though you are facing nothing but difficulties, see it as an invaluable opportunity to experience the greatest joy that you can!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">For you know that when your faith is tested</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">it stirs up in you the power of endurance.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">And then as your endurance grows even stronger, it will release perfection into every part of your being until there is nothing missing and nothing lacking.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">And if anyone longs to be wise, ask God for wisdom and he will give it! He won&apos;t see your lack of wisdom as an opportunity to scold you over your failures but he will overwhelm your failures with his generous grace.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Just make sure you ask empowered by confident faith without doubting that you will receive. For the ambivalent person believes one minute and doubts the next. Being undecided makes you become like the rough seas driven and tossed by the wind. You&apos;re up one minute and tossed down the next.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">The believer who is poor still has reasons to boast, for he has been placed on high.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">But those who are rich should boast in how God has brought them low and humbled them, for all their earthly glory will one day fade away like a wildflower in the meadow.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">For as the scorching heat of the sun causes the petals of the wildflower to fall off and lose its appearance of beauty,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">so the rich in the midst of their pursuit of wealth will wither away.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">If your faith remains strong, even while surrounded by life&apos;s difficulties, you will continue to experience the untold blessings of God! True happiness comes as you pass the test with faith, and receive the victorious crown of life promised to every lover of God!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">When you are tempted don&apos;t ever say, &apos;God is tempting me,&apos; for God is incapable of being tempted by evil and he is never the source of temptation.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Instead it is each person&apos;s own desires and thoughts that drag them into evil and lure</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">them away into darkness.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Evil desires give birth to evil actions. And when sin is fully mature it can murder you!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">So my friends, don&apos;t be fooled by your own desires!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Every gift</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">God freely gives us is good and perfect,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">streaming down from the Father of lights,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">who shines from the heavens with no hidden shadow or darkness</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">and is never subject to change.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">God was delighted</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">to give us birth by the truth of his infallible Word</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">so that we would fulfill his chosen destiny for us and become the favorite ones out of all his creation!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">My dearest brothers and sisters, take this to heart: Be quick to listen,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">but slow to speak. And be slow to become angry,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">for human anger is never a legitimate tool to promote God&apos;s righteous purpose.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">So this is why we abandon everything morally impure</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">and all forms of wicked conduct.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Instead, with a sensitive spirit</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">we absorb God&apos;s Word, which has been implanted within our nature, for the Word of Life has power to continually deliver us.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Don&apos;t just listen to the Word of Truth and not respond to it, for that is the essence of self-deception. So always let his Word become like poetry written and fulfilled by your life!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">If you listen to the Word and don&apos;t live out the message you hear, you become like the person who looks in the mirror of the Word to discover the reflection of his face in the beginning.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">You perceive how God sees you in the mirror of the Word</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">but then you go out and forget</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">your divine origin.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">But those who set their gaze deeply into the perfecting law of liberty</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">are fascinated by and respond to the truth they hear and are strengthened by it&apos;they experience God&apos;s blessing in all that they do!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">If someone believes they have a relationship with God but fails to guard his words then his heart is drifting away and his religion is shallow and empty.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">True spirituality</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">that is pure in the eyes of our Father God is to make a difference in the lives of the orphans,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">and widows in their troubles, and to refuse to be corrupted by the world&apos;s values.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="2">
			<VERS vnumber="1">My dear brothers and sisters, fellow believers in our glorious Lord Jesus Christ&apos;how could we say that we have faith in him and yet we favor one group of people above another?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Suppose an influential man comes into your worship meeting wearing gold rings and expensive clothing, and also a homeless man in shabby clothes comes in.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">If you show special attention to the rich man in expensive clothes and say, &apos;Here&apos;s a seat of honor for you right up front!&apos; but you turn and say to the poor beggar dressed in rags, &apos;You can stand over here,&apos; or &apos;Sit over there on the floor in the back,&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">then you&apos;ve demonstrated gross prejudice among yourselves and used evil standards of judgment!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">So listen carefully, my dear brothers and sisters, hasn&apos;t God chosen</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">the poor in the world&apos;s eyes to be those who are rich in faith?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">And won&apos;t they be the heirs of the kingdom-realm he promised to those who love him?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">But yet you insult and shun the poor</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">in your efforts to impress the rich</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Isn&apos;t it the wealthy who exploit you and drag you into court?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Aren&apos;t they the very ones who blaspheme the beautiful name of the One you now belong to?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Your calling is to fulfill the royal law of love</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">as given to us in this Scripture: &apos;You must love and value your neighbor as you love and value yourself!&apos; For keeping this law is the noble way to live.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">But when you show prejudice you commit sin and you violate this royal law of love!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">For the one who attempts to keep all of the law of Moses but fails in just one point has become guilty of breaking the law in every respect!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">For the same One who tells us, &apos;Do not commit adultery,&apos; also said, &apos;Do not murder.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Now if you don&apos;t commit adultery but do commit murder, you are still guilty as a law-breaker.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">So we must both speak and act in every respect like those who are destined to be tried by the perfect law of liberty,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">and remember that judgment is merciless for the one who judges others without mercy. So by showing mercy, you take dominion over judgment!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">My dear brothers and sisters, what good is it if someone claims to have faith but demonstrates no good works to prove it? How could this kind of faith save anyone?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">For example, if a brother or sister in the faith is poorly clothed and hungry</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">and you leave them saying, &apos;Good-bye. I hope you stay warm and have plenty to eat,&apos; but you don&apos;t provide them with a coat or even a cup of soup, what good is your faith?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">So then faith that doesn&apos;t involve action is phony.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">But someone might object and say, &apos;One person has faith and another person has works.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Go ahead then and prove to me that you have faith without works and I will show you faith by my works as proof that I believe.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">You can believe all you want that there is one true God,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">that&apos;s wonderful! But even the demons know this and tremble with fear before him,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">yet they&apos;re unchanged&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">they remain demons</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">O feeble sons of Adam,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">do you need further evidence that faith divorced from good works is phony?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Wasn&apos;t our ancestor Abraham found righteous before God because of his works when he offered his son Isaac on the altar?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Can&apos;t you see how his action cooperated with his faith and by his action faith found its full expression?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">So in this way the Scripture was fulfilled: Because Abraham believed God, his faith was exchanged for God&apos;s righteousness. So he became known as the lover of God!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">So now it&apos;s clear that a person is seen as righteous in God&apos;s eyes not merely by faith alone, but by his works.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">And the same is true of the prostitute named Rahab who was found righteous in God&apos;s eyes by her works, for she received the spies into her home and helped them escape from the city by another route.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">For just as a human body without the spirit is a dead corpse, so faith without the expression of good works is dead!</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1">My dear brothers and sisters, don&apos;t be so eager to become a teacher in the church since you know that we who teach are held to a higher standard of judgment.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">We all fail in many areas, but especially with our words. Yet if we&apos;re able to bridle the words we say we are powerful enough to control ourselves in every way, and that means our character is mature and fully developed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Horses have bits and bridles in their mouths so that we can control and guide their large body.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">And the same with mighty ships, though they are massive and driven by fierce winds, yet they are steered by a tiny rudder at the direction of the person at the helm.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">And so the tongue is a small part of the body yet it carries great power!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Just think of how a small flame can set a huge forest ablaze.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">And the tongue is a fire! It can be compared to the sum total of wickedness</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">and is the most dangerous part of our human body. It corrupts the entire body</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">and is a hellish flame!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">It releases a fire that can burn throughout the course of human existence.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">For every wild animal on earth including birds, creeping reptiles, and creatures of the sea and land</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">have all been overpowered and tamed by humans,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">but the tongue is not able to be tamed. It&apos;s a fickle, unrestrained evil that spews out words full of toxic poison!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">We use our tongue to praise God our Father</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">and then turn around and curse a person who was made in his very image!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Out of the same mouth we pour out words of praise one minute and curses the next. My brothers and sisters, this should never be!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">If you consider yourself to be wise and one who understands the ways of God, advertise it with a beautiful, fruitful</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">life guided by wisdom&apos;s gentleness. Never brag or boast about what you&apos;ve done and you&apos;ll prove that you&apos;re truly wise.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">But if there is bitter jealousy or competition hiding in your heart, then don&apos;t deny it and try to compensate for it by boasting and being phony.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">For that has nothing to do with God&apos;s heavenly wisdom but can best be described as the wisdom of this world, both selfish</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">and devilish.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">So wherever jealousy</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">and selfishness are uncovered, you will also find many troubles</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">and every kind of meanness.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">But the wisdom from above is always pure,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">filled with peace, considerate and teachable.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">It is filled with love</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">and never displays prejudice or hypocrisy</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">in any form</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">and it always bears the beautiful harvest of righteousness! Good seeds of wisdom&apos;s fruit will be planted with peaceful acts by those who cherish making peace.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="4">You have become spiritual adulterers who are having an affair, an unholy relationship with the world. Don&apos;t you know that flirting with the world&apos;s values places you at odds with God? Whoever chooses to be the world&apos;s friend makes himself God&apos;s enemy!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Does the Scripture mean nothing to you that says, &apos;The Spirit that God breathed into our hearts is a jealous Lover who intensely desires to have more and more of us&apos;?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">But he continues to pour out more and more grace</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">upon us. For it says, &apos;God resists you when you are proud but continually pours out grace when you are humble.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">So then, surrender to God. Stand up to the devil and resist him and he will flee in agony.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Move your heart closer and closer to God, and he will come even closer to you.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="10">Be willing to be made low before the Lord and he will exalt you!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Dear friends, as part of God&apos;s family, never speak against another family member, for when you slander a brother or sister you violate</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="12">There is only one true Lawgiver and Judge, the One who has the power to save and destroy&apos;so who do you think you are to judge your neighbor?</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="14">But you don&apos;t have a clue what tomorrow may bring. For your fleeting life is but a warm breath of air that is visible in the cold only for a moment and then vanishes!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Instead you should say, &apos;Our tomorrows are in the Lord&apos;s hands and if he is willing we will live life to its fullest and do this or that.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">But here you are, boasting in your ignorance, for to be presumptuous about what you&apos;ll do tomorrow is evil!</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="4">Listen! Can&apos;t you hear the cries of the laborers</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">over the wages you fraudulently held back from those who worked for you?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">The cries for justice of those you&apos;ve cheated have reached the ears of the Lord of armies!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">You have indulged yourselves with every luxury and pleasure this world offers, but you&apos;re only stuffing your heart full for a day of slaughter.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">You have condemned and murdered good and innocent people</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">who had no power to defend themselves.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Meanwhile, brothers and sisters, we must be patient and filled with expectation as we wait for the appearing</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="8">So you also, keep your hopes high and be patient, for the presence of the Lord is drawing closer.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="12">Above all we must be those who never need to verify our speech as truthful by swearing by the heavens or the earth or any other oath.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">But instead we must be so full of integrity that our &apos;Yes&apos; or &apos;No&apos; is convincing enough and we do not stumble into hypocrisy.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Are there any believers in your fellowship suffering great hardship and distress? Encourage them to pray!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Are there happy, cheerful ones among you? Encourage them to sing out their praises!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Are there any sick among you? Then ask the elders of the church to come and pray over the sick and anoint them with oil in the name of our Lord.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">And the prayer of faith</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="16">Confess and acknowledge how you have offended one another</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">and then pray for one another to be instantly healed,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">for tremendous power is released through the passionate, heartfelt prayer</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">of a godly believer!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Elijah was a man with human frailties, just like all of us, but he prayed and received supernatural answers.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">He actually shut the heavens over the land so there would be no rain for three and a half years!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Then he prayed again and the skies opened up over the land so that the rain came again and produced the harvest.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Finally, as members of God&apos;s beloved family, we must go after the one who wanders from the truth and bring him back.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">For the one who restores the sinning believer back to God from the error of his way, gives back to his soul</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="6">to her husband, Abraham, and even called him &apos;master.&apos; And you have become her daughters when you do what is right without fear and intimidation.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Husbands, you in turn must treat your wives with tenderness,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">viewing them</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">as feminine</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">partners who deserve to be honored, for they are co-heirs with you of the &apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">divine</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">grace of life,&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">so that nothing will hinder your prayers.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Now, this is the goal: to live in harmony with one another and demonstrate affectionate love,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">sympathy,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">and kindness toward other believers. Let humility describe who you are as you dearly love one another.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Never retaliate when someone treats you wrongly, nor insult those who insult you, but instead, respond by speaking a blessing over them&apos;because a blessing is what God promised to give you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">For the Scriptures tell us: Whoever wants to embrace true life and find beauty in each day</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">must stop speaking evil, hurtful words and never deceive in what they say. Always turn from what is wrong and cultivate what is good; eagerly pursue peace in every relationship, making it your prize.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">For the eyes of the Lord Yahweh</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">rest upon the godly, and his heart responds to their prayers. But he turns his back on those who practice evil.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Why would anyone harm</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">you if you&apos;re passionate and devoted</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">to pleasing God?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">But even if you happen to suffer for doing what is right, you will have the</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">joyful</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">experience of the blessing of God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">And Don&apos;t be intimidated or terrified by those who would terrify you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">But give reverent honor in your hearts to the Anointed One and treat him as the holy Master</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">of your lives</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">. And if anyone asks</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">about the hope living within you, always be ready to explain your faith</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">with gentleness and respect. Maintain a clean conscience, so that those who slander you for living a pure life in Christ will have to lie about you and will be ashamed because of their slander.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">For it is better to suffer for doing good, if it is in God&apos;s plan, than for doing evil.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Christ suffered and died</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">for sins once and for all&apos;the innocent for the guilty</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">&apos;to bring you near to God by his body</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">being put to death and by being raised to life by the Spirit.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">He went in the spiritual realm</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">and made a proclamation to the spirits in prison</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">because of their disobedience of long ago.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">For during the time of Noah God patiently waited while the ark was being prepared, but only a few were brought safely through the floodwaters: a total of eight souls.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">This was a prophetic picture</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">of the immersion that now saves you&apos;not a bathing of the physical body but rather the response of a good conscience before God</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">through the resurrection of Jesus Christ,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">who is now in heaven at the place of supreme authority next to God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">The very powers of heaven, including every angel and authority, now yield in submission to him.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="4">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Since Christ,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">though innocent</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">, suffered in his flesh for you,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">now you also must be a prepared soldier,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">having the same mind-set,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">for whoever has died in his body is done with sin.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">So live the rest of your earthly life no longer concerned with human desires but</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">consumed</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">with what brings pleasure to God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">For you have already spent enough time doing what unbelievers</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">love to do&apos;living in debauchery, sensuality, partying, drunkenness, wild drinking parties,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">and the worship of demons.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">They marvel that you no longer rush to join them in the excesses of their corrupt lifestyles, and so they vilify you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">But one day they will have to give an account to the one who is destined to judge the living and the dead.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">This is the reason the gospel was preached to the</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">martyrs before they gave their lives</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Even though they were judged by human standards, now they live in spirit by God&apos;s standards.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Since we are approaching the end of all things, be intentional, purposeful,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">and self-controlled so that you can be given to prayer.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Above all, constantly echo</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">God&apos;s</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">intense love for one another, for love will be a canopy over a multitude of sins.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Be compassionate to foreigners</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">without complaining.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Every believer has received grace gifts, so use them to serve one another as faithful stewards of the many-colored tapestry of God&apos;s grace.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">For example</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">, if you have a speaking</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">gift</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">, speak as though God were speaking his words through you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">If you have</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">the gift of</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">serving, do it</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">passionately</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">with the strength God gives you,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">so that in everything God</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">alone</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">will be glorified through Jesus Christ. For to him belong the power and the glory forever throughout all ages! Amen.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Beloved friends, if life gets extremely difficult, with many tests,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">don&apos;t be bewildered as though something strange were overwhelming you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Instead, continue to rejoice, for you, in a measure, have shared in the sufferings of the Anointed One so that</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">you can share in</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">the revelation of his glory and celebrate with</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">even greater</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">gladness!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">If you are insulted because of the name of Christ, you are greatly blessed,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">because the Spirit of glory and power,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">who is the Spirit of God, rests upon you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Let none of you merit suffering as a murderer, or thief, or criminal, or as one who meddles in the affairs of others.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">If you suffer for being a Christian, don&apos;t consider it a disgrace but</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">a privilege</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">. Glorify God because you carry the Anointed One&apos;s name.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">For the time is ripe for judgment to begin in God&apos;s own household. And if it starts with us, what will be the fate of those who refuse to obey the gospel of God?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">And: If the righteous are barely saved, what will become of the wicked and godless?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">So then, those who suffer for following God&apos;s will should enfold their lives into the Creator, who will never fail them, and continue to always do what is right.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="5">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Now, I encourage you as an elder,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">an eyewitness of the sufferings of Christ, and one who shares in the glory that is about to be unveiled. I urge my fellow elders among you</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">to be</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">compassionate</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">shepherds who</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">tenderly</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">care for God&apos;s flock and who feed them well, for you have the responsibility to guide, protect, and oversee. Consider it a joyous pleasure</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">and not merely a religious duty. Lead from the heart under God&apos;s leadership&apos;not as a way to gain finances dishonestly but as a way</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">to</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">eagerly and cheerfully</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">serve</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Don&apos;t be controlling tyrants</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">but lead others by your beautiful examples to the flock.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">And when the Shepherd-King</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">appears, you will win the victor&apos;s crown of glory that never fades away.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">In the same way, the younger ones should willingly support</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">the leadership of the elders. In every relationship, each of you must wrap around yourself the apron of a humble servant. Because: God resists you when you are proud but multiplies grace and favor when you are humble.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">If you bow low in God&apos;s awesome presence,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">he will eventually exalt you as you leave the timing in his hands.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Pour out all your worries and stress upon him</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">and leave them there</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">, for he always tenderly cares for you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Be well balanced and always alert, because your enemy,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">the devil, roams around incessantly, like a roaring lion looking for its prey to devour.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Take a decisive stand against him and resist his every attack with strong, vigorous faith. For you know that your believing brothers and sisters around the world are experiencing the same kinds of troubles you endure.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">And then, after your brief suffering,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">the God of all loving grace, who has called you to share in his eternal glory in Christ,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">will personally and powerfully restore you and make you stronger than ever. Yes, he will set you firmly in place and build you up.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">And he has all the power needed to do this</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">&apos;forever!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Amen.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">I, Peter, with the help of Silas,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">whom I consider a trustworthy, faith-filled brother, have written you this short letter so that I might encourage you and personally testify that this is the true, dependable grace of God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Stand fast in this grace.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">She who is in Babylon,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">who is co-elect with you, sends her greetings, along with Mark, my son.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Greet one another with a kiss of peace. Peace to all who are in life union with Christ. Amen.</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="1">
			<VERS vnumber="1">This letter is from</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">Simeon</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">Peter, a</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">loving</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">servant</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">and an apostle of Jesus Christ. I am writing to those who have been given a faith</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">as equally precious as ours through the righteousness of our God and Savior, Jesus Christ.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">May grace and perfect peace cascade over you</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">as you</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">live</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">in the rich knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Everything we could ever need for life and godliness</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">has already been deposited in us by his divine power.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">For all this was lavished upon us</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">through the rich experience of knowing him who has called us by name and invited us to come to him through a glorious manifestation of his goodness.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">As a result of this, he has given you</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">magnificent promises</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">that are beyond all price, so that through</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">the power of</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">these tremendous promises</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">we can experience partnership</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">with the divine nature, by which you have escaped</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">the corrupt desires that are of the world.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">So devote yourselves</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">to lavishly supplementing</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">your faith with goodness, and to goodness add understanding,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">and to understanding add the strength of self-control, and to self-control add patient endurance, and to patient endurance add godliness,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">and to godliness add mercy toward your brothers and sisters, and to mercy toward others add unending love.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Since these virtues are already</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">planted</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">deep within,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">and you possess them in abundant supply,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">they will keep you from being inactive or fruitless in your pursuit of knowing Jesus Christ more intimately.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">But if anyone lacks these things, he is blind, constantly closing his eyes to the mysteries of our faith,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">and forgetting</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">his innocence</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">&apos;for his past sins have been washed away.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">For this reason, beloved ones,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">be eager to confirm and validate</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">that God has invited you</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">to salvation</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">and claimed you</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">as his own. If you do these things, you will never stumble.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">As a result, the kingdom&apos;s gates will open wide to you as God choreographs</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">your triumphant entrance into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior, Jesus the Messiah.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">I won&apos;t hesitate to continually remind you of these truths, even though you are aware of them and are well established in the present measure of truth you have already embraced.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">And as long as I live</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">I will continue to awaken you with this reminder,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">since our Lord Jesus, the Anointed One, has clearly revealed that my departure is near.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Indeed, I&apos;m passionate</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">to share these things with you so that you will always remember them after my exodus from this life.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">We were not retelling some masterfully crafted legend when we informed you of the power and appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">for we saw his magnificence and splendor</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">unveiled</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">before our very eyes.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Yes, Father God lavished upon him radiant glory and honor when his distinct voice spoke out of the realm of majestic glory,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">endorsing him with these words: This is my cherished Son, marked by my love. All my delight is found in him!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">And we ourselves heard that voice resound from the heavens while we were with him on the holy mountain.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">And so we have been given the prophetic word&apos;the</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">written</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">message of the prophets, made more reliable and fully validated</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">by the confirming voice of God on the Mount of Transfiguration</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">And you will continue to do well if you stay focused on it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">For this prophetic message</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">is like a piercing light</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">shining in a gloomy place</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">until the dawning of a new day,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">when the Morning Star</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">rises in your hearts.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">You must understand this at the outset: Interpretation of scriptural prophecy</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">requires the Holy Spirit</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">, for it does not originate from someone&apos;s own imagination.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">No true prophecy comes from human initiative but is inspired by the moving of the Holy Spirit upon those</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">who spoke the message that came from God.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="2">
			<VERS vnumber="1">In the past there arose false prophets</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">among</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">God&apos;s</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">people, just as there will continue to be false teachers who will secretly infiltrate in your midst</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">to divide you</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">, bringing with them their destructive heresies.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">They will even deny the Master, who paid the price for them, bringing swift destruction on themselves.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Many will follow immoral lifestyles.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Because of these</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">corrupt false teachers</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">, the way of truth</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">will be slandered.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">They are only out for themselves,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">ready to exploit you for their own gain through their cunning arguments. Their condemnation has been a long time coming. But their destruction does not slumber</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">or sit idly by,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">for it is sure to come</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Now,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">don&apos;t forget</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">, God had no pity for the angels when they sinned</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">but threw them into the lowest, darkest dungeon of gloom</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">and locked them in chains, where they are firmly held until the judgment of torment.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">And he did not spare the former world</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">in the days of Noah</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">when he sent a flood to destroy a depraved world</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">(although he protected Noah, the preacher of righteousness, along with seven members of his family).</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">And</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">don&apos;t forget that</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">he reduced to ashes the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah, condemning them to ruin and destruction.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">God appointed them to be examples as to what is coming to the ungodly.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Yet he rescued a righteous man, Lot, suffering the indignity of the unbridled lusts of the lawless.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">For righteous Lot lived among them day after day, distressed in his righteous soul by the rebellious deeds he saw and heard.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">If the Lord Yahweh</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">rescued Lot</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">, he knows how to continually rescue the godly from their trials and to reserve the ungodly for punishment on the day of judgment.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">And this especially applies to those who live their lives despising authorities</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">and who abandon themselves to chasing the depraved lusts of their flesh. They are willfully arrogant and insolent, unafraid to insult the glorious ones.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Yet even angels, who are greater than they in power and strength, do not dare slander them before the Lord.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">These individuals are nothing but brute beasts&apos;irrational creatures, born in the wild to be caught and destroyed&apos;and they will perish like beasts. They are professional insulters, who slander whatever they don&apos;t understand, and in their destruction they will be destroyed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">For all the evil they have done will come crashing down on them. They consider it their great pleasure to carouse in broad daylight. When they come to your love feasts</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">they are but stains and blemishes, reveling in their deceptions as they feast with you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">They are addicted to adultery, with eyes that are insatiable,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">with sins that never end. They seduce the vulnerable and are experts in their greed&apos;they are but children of a curse!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">They have wandered off the main road and have gone astray, because they are prophets who love profit&apos;the wages they earn by wrongdoing. They are following the example of Balaam, son of Beor,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">who was rebuked for evil by a donkey incapable of speech yet that spoke with a human voice and restrained the prophet&apos;s madness.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">These people are dried-up riverbeds, waterless clouds pushed along by stormy winds&apos;the deepest darkness of gloom has been prepared for them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">They spout off with their grandiose, impressive nonsense. Consumed with the lusts of the flesh, they lure</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">back into sin</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">those who recently escaped from their error.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">They promise others freedom, yet they themselves are slaves to corruption, for people are slaves to whatever overcomes them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Those who escape the corrupting forces of this world system through the experience of knowing about our Lord and Savior, Jesus the Messiah, then go back into entanglement with them and are defeated by them, becoming worse off than they were to start with.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">It would have been much better for them never to have experienced the way of righteousness than to know it and then turn away from the sacred obligation</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">that was given to them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">They become illustrations of the true proverb: A dog will return to his own vomit and a washed pig to its rolling in the mud.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="3">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Beloved friends, this is now the second letter I have written to you</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">in which I&apos;ve attempted to stir you up and awaken you to a proper mind-set.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">So never forget both the prophecies spoken by the holy prophets of old and the teaching</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">of our Lord and Savior spoken by your apostles.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Above all, you must understand that in the last days mockers</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">will multiply, chasing after their evil desires.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">They will say, &apos;So what about this promise of his coming?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Our ancestors are dead and buried, yet everything is still the same as it was since from the beginning of time until now.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">But they conveniently overlook that from the beginning, the heavens and earth were created by God&apos;s word.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">He spoke</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">and the dry ground separated from the waters.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Then long afterward he destroyed the world with a tremendous flood by those very waters.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">And now, by the same</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">powerful</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">word, the heavens and the earth are reserved for fire,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">being kept for judgment day, when all the ungodly will perish.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">So, dear friends, don&apos;t let this one thing escape your notice: a single day counts like a thousand years to the Lord Yahweh,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">and a thousand years counts as one day.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">This means that,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">contrary to man&apos;s perspective</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">, the Lord is not late with his promise</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">to return</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">, as some measure lateness. But rather, his &apos;delay&apos; simply reveals his loving patience toward you, because he does not want any to perish but all to come to repentance.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">The day of the Lord will come and take everyone by surprise&apos;as unexpected as a home invasion. The atmosphere will be set on fire and vanish with a horrific roar, and the heavenly bodies</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">will melt away as in a tremendous blaze. The earth and every activity of man will be laid bare.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Since all these things are on the verge of being dismantled, don&apos;t you see how vital it is to live a holy life? We must be consumed with godliness</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">while we anticipate and help to speed up the coming of the day of God,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">when the atmosphere will be set on fire and the heavenly bodies consumed in a blaze.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">But as we wait, we trust in God&apos;s royal proclamation to be fulfilled. There are coming</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">heavens new in quality, and an earth new in quality, where righteousness will be fully at home.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">So, my beloved friends, with all that you have to look forward to, may you be eager to be found living pure lives</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">when you come into his presence</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">without blemish and filled with peace.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">And keep in mind that our Lord&apos;s extraordinary patience simply means</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">more opportunity for</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">salvation,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">just as our dear brother Paul wrote to you with the wisdom that God gave him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">He consistently speaks of these things in all of his letters, even though he writes some concepts that are overwhelming to our understanding, which the unlearned and unstable love to twist to their</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">spiritual</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">ruin, as they do to other Scriptures.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">As for you, divinely loved ones, since you are forewarned of these things, be careful that you are not led astray by the error of the lawless and lose your firm grip</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">on the truth</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">But continue to grow and increase in God&apos;s grace and intimacy with our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1">We saw him with our very own eyes. We gazed upon him and heard him speak. Our hands actually touched him, the one who was from the beginning, the Living Expression of God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">This Life-Giver was made visible and we have seen him. We testify to this truth: the eternal Life-Giver lived face-to-face with the Father and has now dawned upon us.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">So we proclaim to you what we have seen and heard about this Life-Giver so that we may share and enjoy this life together. For truly our fellowship is with the Father and with his Son, Jesus, the Anointed One.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">We are writing these things to you because we want to release to you our fullness of joy.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">This is the life-giving message</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">we heard him share</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">and it&apos;s still ringing in our ears</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">. We now repeat his words to you: God is pure light. You will never find even a trace of darkness in him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">If we claim that we share life with him,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">but keep walking in the realm of darkness, we&apos;re fooling ourselves and not living the truth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">But if we keep living in the pure light that surrounds him,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">we share</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">unbroken</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">fellowship with one another,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">and the blood of Jesus, his Son, continually cleanses us from all sin.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">If we boast that we have no sin, we&apos;re only fooling ourselves and are strangers to the truth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">But if we freely admit our sins</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">when his light uncovers them</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">he will be faithful to forgive us every time. God is just to forgive us our sins</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">because of Christ</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">, and he will continue to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">If we claim that we&apos;re not guilty of sin</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">when God uncovers it with his light</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">we make him a liar and his word is not in us.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="2">
			<VERS vnumber="1">You are my dear children, and I write these things to you so that you won&apos;t sin. But if anyone does sin, we continually have a forgiving Redeemer</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">who is face-to-face with the Father:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">Jesus Christ, the Righteous One.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">He is the atoning sacrifice</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">for our sins, and not only for ours but also for the sins of the whole world.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Here&apos;s how we can be sure that we&apos;ve truly come to know God: if we keep his commands.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">If someone claims, &apos;I have come to know God</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">by experience</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">,&apos; yet doesn&apos;t keep God&apos;s commands, he is a phony and the truth finds no place in him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">But the love of God will be perfected within the one who obeys God&apos;s Word. We can be sure that we&apos;ve truly come to live in intimacy with God,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">not just by saying, &apos;I am intimate with God,&apos; but by walking in the footsteps of Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Beloved, I&apos;m not writing a new commandment to you, but an old one that you had from the beginning, and you&apos;ve already heard it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Yet, in a sense, it is a new commandment,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">as its truth is made manifest both in Christ and in you, because the darkness is disappearing and the true light is already blazing.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Anyone who says, &apos;I am in the light,&apos; while holding hatred in his heart toward a fellow believer is still in the darkness.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">But the one who truly loves a fellow believer lives in the light, and there is nothing in him that will cause someone else to stumble.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">But whoever hates a fellow believer lives in the darkness&apos;stumbling around in the dark with no clue where he is going, for he is blinded by the darkness.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">I remind you, dear children:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">your sins have been permanently removed because of the power of his name.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">I remind you, fathers</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">and mothers</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">you have a relationship with the One who has existed from the beginning. And I remind you, young people: you have defeated the Evil One.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">I write these things to you, dear children, because you truly have a relationship with the Father. I write these things, fathers</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">and mothers</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">, because you have had a true relationship with him who is from the beginning. And I write these things, young people, because you are strong, the Word of God is treasured in your hearts, and you have defeated the Evil One.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Don&apos;t set the affections of your heart on this world</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">or in loving the things of the world. The love of the Father and the love of the world are incompatible.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">For all that the world can offer us&apos;the gratification of our flesh, the allurement of the things of the world, and the obsession with status and importance</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">&apos;none of these things come from the Father but from the world.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">This world</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">and its desires are in the process of passing away, but those who</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">love to</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">do the will of God live forever.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Dear children, the end</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">of this age</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">is near! You have heard that Antichrist is arising,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">and in fact, many enemies of Christ have already appeared, and this is how we know that we are living in the closing hour</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">of this age</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">For even though they were once a part of us</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">, they withdrew from us because they were never really of our number. For if they had truly belonged to us they would have continued with us.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">By leaving our community of believers they made it obvious that they never really belonged to us.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">But the Holy One has anointed you and you all know</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">the truth</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">So I&apos;m writing to you not because you don&apos;t know the truth, but because you do know it, and no lie belongs to the truth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Who is the real liar but the one who denies that Jesus is the Christ. He is the real antichrist, the one who denies the Father and the Son.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">Whoever rejects the Son rejects the Father. Whoever embraces</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">the Son embraces the Father also.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">So you must be sure to keep the message burning</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">in your hearts; that is, the message</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">of life</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">you heard from the beginning. If you do, you will always be living in close fellowship with the Son and with the Father.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">And he himself has promised us the never-ending life of the ages to come!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">I&apos;ve written these things about those who are attempting to lead you astray.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">But the wonderful anointing you have received from God</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">is so much greater than their deception and</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">now lives in you. There&apos;s no need for anyone to keep teaching you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">His anointing teaches you all that you need to know, for it will lead you into truth, not a counterfeit. So just as the anointing has taught you, remain in him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">And now, dear children, remain in him, so that when he is revealed we may have joyful confidence and not be ashamed when we stand before him at his appearing.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">If you know that he is righteous, you may be sure that everyone who lives in righteousness has been divinely fathered by him.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="3">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Look with wonder at the depth of the Father&apos;s marvelous love that he has lavished on us! He has called us and made us his very own</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">beloved</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">children.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">The reason the world doesn&apos;t recognize who we are is that they didn&apos;t recognize him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Beloved, we are God&apos;s children right now; however, it is not yet apparent what we will become. But we do know that when it</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">is finally made visible,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">we will be just like him, for we will see him as he truly is.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">And all who focus their hope on him will always be purifying</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">themselves,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">just as Jesus is pure.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Anyone who indulges in sin</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">lives in moral anarchy, for</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">the definition of</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">sin is breaking God&apos;s law.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">And you know without a doubt that Jesus was revealed to eradicate sins, and there is no sin in him. Anyone who continues to live in union with him will not sin.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">But the one who continues sinning</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">hasn&apos;t seen him</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">with discernment</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">or known him</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">by intimate experience</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Delightfully loved children, don&apos;t let anyone divert you from this truth. The person who keeps doing what is right</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">proves that he</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">is righteous before God, even as the Messiah</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">is righteous.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">But the one who indulges in a sinful life is of the devil,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">because the devil has been sinning from the beginning. The reason the Son of God was revealed was to undo and destroy the works of the devil.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Everyone who is truly God&apos;s child will refuse to keep sinning</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">because God&apos;s seed</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">remains within him, and he is unable to continue sinning because he has been fathered by God himself.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Here is how God&apos;s children can be clearly distinguished from the children of the Evil One.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Anyone who does not demonstrate righteousness</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">and show love to fellow believers is not living with God as his source.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">The beautiful message you&apos;ve heard right from the start is that we should walk in self-sacrificing love toward one another.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">We should not be like Cain, who yielded to the Evil One and brutally murdered his own brother,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Abel</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">And why did he murder him? Because his own actions were evil and his brother&apos;s righteous.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">So don&apos;t be shocked, beloved brothers and sisters, if you experience the world&apos;s hatred.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Yet we can be assured that we have been translated from</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">spiritual</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">death into</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">spiritual</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">life because we love the family of believers. A loveless life remains spiritually dead.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Everyone who keeps hating a fellow believer is a murderer,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">and you know that no murderer has eternal life residing in him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">This is how we have discovered love&apos;s reality: Jesus sacrificed his life for us.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Because of this great love, we should be willing to lay down our lives for one another.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">If anyone sees a fellow believer in need and has the means to help him, yet shows no pity and closes his heart against him, how is it even possible that God&apos;s love lives in him?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Beloved children, our love can&apos;t be an abstract theory we only talk about, but a way of life demonstrated through our loving deeds.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">We know that the truth lives within us</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">because we demonstrate love in action, which will reassure</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">our hearts in his presence.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Whenever our hearts make us feel guilty</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">and remind us of our failures</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">, we know that God is much greater</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">and more merciful</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">than our conscience, and he knows everything there is to know</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">about us</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">My delightfully loved friends, when our hearts don&apos;t condemn us, we have a bold freedom to speak face-to-face with God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">And whatever we ask of him we receive,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">because we keep his commands. And by our beautiful intentions</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">we continue to do what brings pleasure to him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">So these are his commands: that we continually place our trust in the name of his Son, Jesus Christ, and that we keep loving one another, just as he has commanded us.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">For all who obey his commands find their lives joined in union with him, and he lives and flourishes in them. We know and have proof that he constantly lives and flourishes in us, by the Spirit that he has given us.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="4">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Delightfully loved friends, don&apos;t trust every spirit, but carefully examine</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">what they say</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">to determine if they are of God, because many false prophets have mingled into the world.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Here&apos;s the test for those with the genuine Spirit of God: they will confess Jesus as the Christ who has come in the flesh.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Everyone who does not acknowledge that Jesus is from God has the spirit of antichrist, which you heard was coming and is already active in the world.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Little children,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">you can be certain that</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">you belong to God and have conquered them,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">for the One who is living in you is far greater than the one who is in the world.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">They belong to this world and they articulate the spirit of this world, and the world listens to them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">But we belong to God, and whoever truly knows God listens to us. Those who refuse to listen to us do not belong to God. That is how we can know the difference between the spirit of truth and the spirit of deceit.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Those who are loved by God, let his love continually pour from you to one another, because God is love. Everyone who loves is fathered by God and experiences an intimate knowledge of him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">The one who doesn&apos;t love has yet to know God, for God is love.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">The light of God&apos;s love shined within us</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">when he sent his matchless</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Son into the world so that we might live through him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">This is love:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">He loved us</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">long before we loved him</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">. It was his love, not ours. He proved it by sending his Son to be the pleasing sacrificial offering to take away our sins.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Delightfully loved ones, if he loved us with such tremendous love, then &apos;loving one another&apos; should be our way of life!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">No one has ever gazed</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">upon the fullness of God&apos;s splendor.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">But if we love one another, God makes his permanent home in us, and we make our permanent home in him, and his love is brought to its full expression in us.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">And he has given us his Spirit within us so that we can have the assurance that he lives in us and that we live in him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Moreover, we have seen with our own eyes and can testify to the truth that Father God has sent his Son to be the Savior of the world.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Those who give thanks</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">that Jesus is the Son of God live in God, and God lives in them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">We have come into an intimate experience with God&apos;s love, and we trust in the love he has for us. God is love! Those who are living in love are living in God, and God lives through them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">By</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">living in God</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">love has been brought to its full expression in us</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">so that we may fearlessly face the day of judgment,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">because all that Jesus now is,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">so are we in this world.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Love never brings fear, for fear is always related to punishment. But love&apos;s perfection drives the fear</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">of punishment far</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">from our hearts. Whoever walks constantly afraid of</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">punishment</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">has not reached love&apos;s perfection.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Our love for others is</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">our grateful response</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">to the love God first demonstrated to us.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Anyone can say, &apos;I love God,&apos; yet have hatred toward another believer. This makes him a phony, because if you don&apos;t love a brother or sister, whom you can see, how can you truly love God, whom you can&apos;t see?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">For he has given us this command: whoever loves God must also demonstrate love to others.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="5">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Everyone who believes that Jesus is the Messiah is God&apos;s spiritual child and has been fathered by God himself. And everyone who loves Father God loves his children as well.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">This is how we can be sure that we love the children of God: by having a passionate love for God and by obedience to his commands.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">True love for God means obeying his commands, and his commands don&apos;t weigh us down as heavy burdens.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">You see</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">, every child of God overcomes</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">the world, for our faith is the victorious power that triumphs over the world.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">So who are the world conquerors,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">defeating its power</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">? Those who believe that Jesus is the Son of God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Jesus Christ is the One who was revealed</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">as God&apos;s Son</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">by his water</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">baptism</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">and by the blood</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">of his cross</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">&apos;not by water only, but by water and blood.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">And the Spirit, who is truth, confirms this with his testimony.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">So we have these three constant witnesses giving their evidence:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">the Spirit, the water, and the blood. And these three are in agreement.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">If we accept the testimony of men,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">how much more should we accept</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">the more authoritative testimony of God that he has testified concerning his Son?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Those who believe in the Son of God have the</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">living</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">testimony in their hearts. Those who don&apos;t believe have made God out to be a liar by not believing the testimony God has confirmed about his Son.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">This is the true testimony: that God has given us eternal life, and this life has its source in his Son.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Whoever has the Son has</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">eternal</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">life; whoever does not have the Son does not possess</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">eternal</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">life.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">I&apos;ve written this letter to you who believe in the name of the Son of God so that you will</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">be assured and</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">know without a doubt that you have eternal life.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Since we have this confidence, we can also have great boldness before him, for if we ask anything agreeable to his will, he will hear us.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">And if we know that he hears us in whatever we ask, we also know that we have obtained the requests we ask of him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">If anyone observes a fellow believer habitually sinning in a way that doesn&apos;t lead to death,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">you should keep interceding in prayer that God will give that person life. Now, there is a sin that leads to death, and I&apos;m not encouraging you to pray for those who commit it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">All unrighteousness is sin, but there is sin that does not result in death.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">We are convinced that everyone fathered by God does not make sinning a way of life, because the Son of God protects the child of God, and the Evil One cannot touch him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">We know that we are God&apos;s children and that the whole world lies under the misery and influence of the Evil One.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">And we know that the Son of God has made our understanding come alive so that we can know by experience the One who is true. And we are in him who is true, God&apos;s Son, Jesus Christ&apos;the true God and eternal life!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">So, little children, guard yourselves from worshiping anything but him.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="5">Dearest woman, I have a request to make of you. It is not a new commandment but a repetition of the one we have had from the beginning: that we constantly love one another.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">This love means living in obedience to whatever God commands us. For to walk in love toward one another is the unifying commandment we&apos;ve heard from the beginning.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Numerous deceivers have surfaced</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">from among us</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="9">Anyone who wanders away</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="9">relationship with both the Father and the Son.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">So if anyone comes</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="5">I commend you for your demonstration</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">of faithful love by all that you have done for the brothers</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">on their journey</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">, even though they were strangers at the time.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">They have shared publicly with the congregation</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">about the beautiful acts of love you have shown them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Now, if you would be so kind, send them on their way</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">with a generous gift</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">, in a manner that would honor God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">You see, it was their passion for</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">the glory of</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">the name</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">of Christ</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">that launched them out, and they&apos;ve not accepted financial support from unbelievers.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">They are deserving of all the support we can give them,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">because through our giving</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">we can partner with them for the truth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">I have already written you once about this,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">but Diotrephes,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">who loves to be in charge and recognized as first among you, does not acknowledge our authority.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">So if I come, I will address what he&apos;s doing&apos;spreading his malicious slander against us.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">And not content with that, he refuses to welcome our brothers,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">and he stands in the way of those who want to receive them and show them hospitality by throwing them out of the church!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Delightfully loved ones, don&apos;t imitate what is evil, but imitate that which is good.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Whoever does good is of God; whoever does evil has not seen God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">As for Demetrius, everyone speaks very highly of him,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">and even the truth itself stands by his side. We too wholeheartedly endorse him, and you know that our recommendation is reliable.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Although I have many more subjects I&apos;d like to discuss with you, I&apos;d rather not include them in this letter.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Instead, I hope to visit you and speak with you face-to-face.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Peace to you,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">my friend</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1">From Judah,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">a loving servant</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">of Jesus, the Anointed One, and brother of Jacob.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">I&apos;m writing</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">to the chosen ones who are wrapped in the love of Father God&apos;kept and guarded for</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">Jesus, the Messiah.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">May God&apos;s mercy, peace, and love</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">cascade over you!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Dearly loved friend, I was fully intending to write to you about our</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">amazing</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">salvation we all participate in, but felt the need instead to challenge you to vigorously defend and contend for</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">the beliefs that we cherish.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">For God,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">through the apostles</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">, has once for all entrusted these truths to his holy believers.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">There have been some who have sneaked in among you unnoticed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">They are depraved people whose judgment was prophesied in Scripture</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">a long time ago. They have perverted</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">the message of</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">God&apos;s grace into a license to commit immorality</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">and turn against</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">our only absolute Master,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">our Lord Jesus Christ.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">I need to remind you, even though you are familiar with it all, that</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">the Lord</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Jesus</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">saved his people out of Egypt but subsequently destroyed those who were guilty of unbelief.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">In the same way, there were heavenly messengers</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">in rebellion</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">who went outside their rightful domain of authority</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">and abandoned their appointed realms.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">God bound them in everlasting chains and is keeping them in the dark abyss of the</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">netherworld</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">until the judgment of the great day.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">In a similar way, the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah and nearby towns</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">gave themselves to sexual immorality and the unnatural desire of different flesh.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Now they all serve as examples of those who experience the punishment of eternal fire.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">In the same way, these sensual &apos;dreamers&apos; corrupt and pollute the natural realm, while on the other hand they reject the</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">spiritual</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">realms of governmental power and repeatedly scoff at heavenly glories.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Even the archangel Michael,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">when he was disputing with the devil over the body of Moses,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">dared not insult or slander him, but simply said, &apos;The Lord Yahweh</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">rebuke you!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">These people insult anything they don&apos;t understand. They behave like irrational beasts by doing whatever they feel like doing.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Because they live by their animal instincts, they corrupt themselves and bring about their own destruction.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">How terrible it is for them!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">For they have followed in the steps of Cain.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">They have abandoned</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">themselves to Balaam&apos;s error because of their greedy pursuit of financial gain.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">And since they have rebelled like Korah rebelled</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">, they will experience the same fate of Korah and likewise perish.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">These false teachers are like dangerous hidden reefs at your love feasts,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">lying in wait to shipwreck the immature</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">. They feast among you without reverence,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">having no shepherd but themselves.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">They are clouds with no rain,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">swept along by the winds.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Like fruitless late-autumn trees</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">&apos;twice dead,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">barren, and plucked up by the roots!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">They are wild waves of the sea, flinging out the foam of their shame and disgrace.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">They are</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">misleading</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">like wandering stars,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">for whom the complete darkness of eternal gloom has been reserved.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Enoch, the seventh direct descendant from Adam,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">prophesied of their doom</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">when he said, &apos;Look! Here comes the Lord Yahweh</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">in his myriads of holy ones.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">He comes</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">to execute judgment against them all and to convict each one of them for their ungodly deeds and for all the terrible words that ungodly sinners have spoken against him.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">These people are always complaining and never satisfied&apos;finding fault with everyone. They follow their own evil desires and their mouths speak scandalous things. They</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">enjoy</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">using seductive flattery to manipulate others.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">But you,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">my</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">delightfully loved friends, remember the prophecies of the apostles of our Lord Jesus, the Anointed One.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">They taught you, &apos;In the last days</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">there will always be mockers, motivated by their own ungodly desires.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">These people cause divisions and are followers of their own natural instincts, devoid of</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">the life of</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">the Spirit.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">But you,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">my</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">delightfully loved friends, constantly and progressively build yourselves up on the foundation of your most holy faith</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">by praying every moment in the Spirit.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Fasten your hearts to the love of God and receive the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ, who gives us eternal life.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Keep being compassionate to those who still have doubts,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">and snatch others out of the fire to save them. Be merciful over and over to them, but always couple your mercy with the fear of God. Be extremely careful to keep yourselves free from the pollutions of the flesh.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">Now, to the one with enough power to prevent you from stumbling</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">into sin</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">and bring you faultless before his glorious presence to stand before him with ecstatic delight,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">to the only God our Savior, through our Lord Jesus Christ, be</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">endless</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">glory and majesty, great power and authority&apos;from before he created time, now, and throughout all the ages of eternity. Amen!</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="10">I was in the spirit realm</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">on the Lord&apos;s day,</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="10">me a loud voice sounding like a trumpet,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">saying to me: Write in a book what you see and send it to the seven churches: to Ephesus, to Smyrna, to Pergamum, to Thyatira, to Sardis, to Philadelphia, and to Laodicea.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">When I turned</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">to see the voice that was speaking to me, I saw seven golden lampstands.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">And walking among the lampstands, I saw someone like a son of man,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">wearing a full-length robe</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">with a golden sash over his chest.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">His head and his hair were white like wool&apos;white as glistening snow.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">And his eyes were like flames of fire!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">His feet were gleaming like bright metal,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">as though they were glowing in a fire,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">and his voice was like the roar of many rushing waters.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">In his right hand he held seven stars, and out of his mouth was a sharp, double-edged sword.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">And his face was shining like the brightness of the blinding sun!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">When I saw him, I fell down at his feet as good as dead,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">but he laid his right hand on me</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">and</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">I heard his reassuring voice</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="18">the Living One! I was dead, but now look&apos;I am alive forever and ever. And I hold the keys</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">that unlock death and the unseen world.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Now I want you to write what you have seen,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">what is, and what comes after the things</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">that I reveal to you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">The mystery of the lampstands</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">and the seven stars is this: the seven lampstands are the seven churches, and the seven stars in my right hand are the seven messengers</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">of the seven churches.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="2">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Write the following to</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">the messenger of the congregation in Ephesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">For these are the words of the one who holds the seven stars firmly in his right hand,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">who walks among the seven golden lampstands:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">I know all that you&apos;ve done for me&apos;you have worked hard and persevered. I know that you don&apos;t tolerate evil. You have tested those who claimed to be apostles and</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">proved</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">they are not,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">for they were imposters.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">I also know how you have bravely endured</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">trials and persecutions</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">because of my name, yet you have not become discouraged.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">But I have this against you: you have abandoned the passionate love you had for me at the beginning.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Think about how far you have fallen! Repent</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">and do the works</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">of love</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">you did at first.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">I will come to you and remove your lampstand from its place</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">of influence</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">if you do not repent.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Although, to your credit, you despise the practices of the Nicolaitans, which I also despise.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">The one whose heart is open let him listen carefully to what the Spirit is saying now to all the churches.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">To the one who overcomes</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">I will give access to feast on the fruit of the Tree of Life that is found in the paradise of God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Write the following to the messenger of the congregation in Smyrna.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">For these are the words of the one who is the Beginning and the End, the one who became a corpse, but came back to life:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">I am aware of all the painful difficulties you have passed through and your financial hardships, even though, in fact, you possess rich treasure.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">And I am fully aware of the slander</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">that has come against you from those who claim to be Jews but are not, for they are a satanic congregation.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Do not yield to fear in the face of the suffering to come but be aware of this: the devil</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">is about to have some of you thrown into prison</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">to test your faith. For ten days</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">you will have distress but remain faithful to the day you die, and I will give you the victor&apos;s crown of life.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">The one whose heart is open let him listen carefully to what the Spirit is presently saying to all the churches. The one who conquers will not be harmed by the second death.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Write the following to the messenger of the congregation in Pergamum.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">For these are the words of the one whose words pierce the hearts of men:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">I know where you live&apos;where Satan sits enthroned, yet you still cling faithfully to the power of my name. You did not deny your faith in me even in the days of my faithful martyr Antipas,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">who was executed in your city, where Satan lives.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Nevertheless, I have a few things against you. There are some among you who hold to the teachings of Balaam, who taught Balak to entice the Israelites to eat things that were sacrificed to idols</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">and to commit sexual immorality.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Furthermore, you have some who hold to the doctrines of the Nicolaitans.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">So repent, then, or I will come quickly to war against them with the sword of my mouth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">But the one whose heart is open, let him listen carefully to what the Spirit is presently saying to all the churches. To everyone who is victorious I will let him feast on the hidden manna</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">and give him a shining white stone.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">And written upon the white stone is inscribed his new name, known only to the one who receives it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Write the following to the messenger of the congregation in Thyatira.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">For these are the words of the Son of God, whose eyes are blazing fire and whose feet are like burnished brass:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">I know all that you&apos;ve done for me&apos;your love and faith, your ministry and steadfast perseverance. In fact, you now excel in these virtues even more than at the first.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">But I have this against you: you are forgiving that woman Jezebel,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">who calls herself a prophetess and is seducing my loving servants. She is teaching that it is permissible to indulge in sexual immorality and to eat food sacrificed to idols.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">I have waited for her to repent from her vile immorality, but she willingly refuses to do so.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">Now I will lay her low</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">with terrible distress</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">along with all her adulterous partners if they do not repent.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">And I will strike down her followers with a deadly plague.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">Then all the congregations will realize that I am the one who thoroughly searches the most secret thought</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">and the innermost being.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">I will give to each one what their works deserve.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">But to the rest of you in Thyatira who don&apos;t adhere to the teachings of Jezebel and have not been initiated into deep satanic secrets,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">I say to you (without laying upon you any other burden):</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">Cling tightly</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">to all that you have until I appear.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">To everyone who is victorious and continues to do my works to the very end I will give you authority over the nations</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">to shepherd them with a royal scepter.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">And</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">the rebellious will be</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">shattered as clay pots&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">even as I also received authority from the presence of my Father.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">I will give the morning star</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28">to the one who experiences victory.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29">So the one whose heart is open let him listen carefully to what the Spirit is presently saying to all the churches.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="3">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Write the following to the messenger of the congregation in Sardis,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">for these are the words of the one who holds the seven Spirits of God</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">and the seven stars: I know all that you do and I know that you have a reputation for being really &apos;alive,&apos; but you&apos;re actually dead!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Wake up and strengthen all that remains before it dies, for I haven&apos;t found your works to be perfect in the sight of my God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">So remember all the things you&apos;ve received and heard, then turn back to God and obey them. For if you continue to slumber, I will come to you like a thief, and you&apos;ll have no idea at what hour I will come.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Yet there are still a few in Sardis who have remained pure,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">and they will walk</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">in fellowship</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">with me in brilliant light,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">for they are worthy.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">And the one who experiences victory will be dressed in white robes and I will never, no never erase your name from the Book of Life. I will acknowledge your name before my Father and his angels.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">So the one whose heart is open let him listen carefully to what the Spirit is now saying to all the churches.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Write the following to the messenger of the congregation in Philadelphia,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">for these are the solemn words of the Holy One, the true one, who has David&apos;s key,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">who opens doors that none can shut and who closes doors that none can open:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">I know all that you&apos;ve done. Now I have set before you a wide-open door</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">that none can shut.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">For I know that you possess only a little power, yet you&apos;ve kept my word and haven&apos;t denied my name.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Watch how I deal with those of the synagogue of Satan who say that they are Jews but are not, for they&apos;re lying. I will make them come and bow down</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">at your feet and acknowledge how much I&apos;ve loved you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Because you&apos;ve passionately kept my message of perseverance, I will also keep you from the hour of proving that is coming to test every person on earth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">But I come swiftly, so cling tightly to what you have, so that no one may seize your crown of victory.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">For the one who is victorious, I will make you to be a pillar in the sanctuary of my God,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">permanently secure.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">I will write on you the name of my God and the name of the city of my God&apos;the New Jerusalem, descending from my God out of heaven.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">And I&apos;ll write my own name on you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">So the one whose heart is open let him listen carefully to what the Spirit is now saying to all the churches.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Write the following to the messenger of the congregation in Laodicea,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">for these are the words of the Amen,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">the faithful and true witness, the ruler</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">of God&apos;s creation:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">I know all that you do, and I know that you are neither frozen in apathy nor fervent with passion.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">How I wish you were either one or the other!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">But because you are neither cold nor hot, but lukewarm, I am about to spit you from my mouth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">For you claim, &apos;I&apos;m rich and getting richer&apos;I don&apos;t need a thing.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Yet you are clueless that you&apos;re miserable, poor, blind, barren, and naked!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">So I counsel you to purchase gold</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">perfected by fire, so that you can be truly rich. Purchase a white garment to cover and clothe your shameful Adam-nakedness.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Purchase eye salve to be placed over your eyes so that you can truly see.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">All those I dearly love I unmask and train.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">So repent and be eager</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1">Then suddenly, after I wrote down these messages, I saw a portal open into the heavenly realm, and the same trumpet-voice I heard speaking with me at the beginning</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">said,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">&apos;Ascend into this realm!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">I want to reveal to you what must happen</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">after this.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Instantly I was taken into the spirit realm,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">and behold&apos;I saw a heavenly throne</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">being set in place and someone seated upon it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">His appearance was</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">sparkling</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">like crystal</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">and</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">glowing</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">like a carnelian gemstone.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Surrounding the throne was a</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">circle of green light</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">like an emerald rainbow.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Encircling the great throne were twenty-four thrones with elders</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">in</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">glistening</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">white garments seated upon them, each wearing a golden crown of victory.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">And</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">pulsing</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">from the throne were</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">blinding</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">flashes of lightning,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">crashes of thunder, and voices.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">And burning before the throne were seven blazing torches, which represent the seven Spirits of God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">And in front of the throne there was</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">pavement</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">like a crystal sea of glass. Around the throne and on each side stood four living creatures, full of eyes in front and behind.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">The first living creature resembled a lion, the second an ox,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">the third had a human face, and the fourth was like an eagle in flight.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Each of the four living creatures had six wings, full of eyes all around and under their wings. They worshiped without ceasing, day and night, singing, &apos;Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God, the Almighty! The Was, the Is, and the Coming!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">And whenever the living creatures gave glory, honor, and thanks to the One who is enthroned and who lives forever and ever,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">the twenty-four elders fell facedown before the one seated on the throne and they worshiped the one who lives forever and ever. And they surrendered their crowns before the throne, singing:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">&apos;You are worthy, our Lord and God, to receive glory, honor, and power, for you created all things, and for your pleasure they were created and exist.&apos;</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="5">
			<VERS vnumber="1">And I saw that the one seated on the throne was holding in</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">his right hand an unopened scroll with writing on the inside and on the outside,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">and it was sealed with seven seals.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Then I saw an incredibly powerful angel</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">proclaiming</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">with a great, loud voice, &apos;Who is worthy to open the scroll and able to break</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">its</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">seven</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">seals?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">But no person could be found, living or dead, in all of creation</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">&apos;no one was worthy to open the scroll and read its contents.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">So I broke down weeping with intense sorrow, because there was found no one worthy to break open the scroll and read its contents.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Then one of the elders said to me, &apos;Stop weeping. Look! The mighty Lion of Judah&apos;s tribe,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">the root of David&apos;he has conquered! He is the worthy one who can open the scroll and its seven seals.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Then I saw a young Lamb</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">standing before</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">the throne, encircled by the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders. He appeared to have been slaughtered</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">but was now alive</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">He had seven horns</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God sent out to the ends of the earth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">I saw the young Lamb approach the throne and take the scroll from the right hand of the one who sat there.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">And when the twenty-four elders and the four living creatures saw the Lamb had taken the scroll, they fell facedown at the feet of the Lamb and worshiped him. Each of them had a harp and golden bowls brimming full of sweet fragrant incense&apos;which are the prayers of God&apos;s holy lovers.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">And they were all singing this new song</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">of praise to the Lamb</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">: &apos;Because you were slaughtered for us, you are worthy to take the scroll and open its seals. Your blood was the price paid to redeem us. You purchased us to bring us to God out of every tribe, language, people group, and nation.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">You have chosen us to serve our God and formed us into a kingdom of priests who reign on the earth.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Then I looked, and I heard the voices of myriads of angels in circles around the throne, as well as the voices of the living creatures and the elders&apos;myriads and myriads!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">And as I watched, all of them were singing with thunderous voices: &apos;Worthy is Christ the Lamb who was slaughtered to receive great power and might, wealth and wisdom, and honor, glory, and praise!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Then every living being joined the angelic choir. Every creature in heaven and on earth, under the earth, in the sea, and everything in them, were</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">worshiping</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">with one voice, saying: &apos;Praise, honor, glory, and dominion be to God-Enthroned and to Christ the Lamb forever and ever!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Then the four living creatures responded: &apos;Amen!&apos; And the twenty-four elders threw themselves facedown to the ground and worshiped.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="6">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Then I watched as the Lamb broke open the first of the seven seals.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">Immediately I heard one of the four living creatures call out with a powerful voice of revelation sounding like thunder, saying, &apos;Come forth!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">So I looked, and behold, there was a bright white horse.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Its rider had a bow</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">and was given a crown of victory. He rode out as a conqueror ready to conquer.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">When he broke open the second seal, I heard the second living creature call out: &apos;Come forth!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">And there appeared another horse, red</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">like fiery flames</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">and its rider was given a great sword and the power to take peace from the earth,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">causing one to put to death another.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Then he broke open the third seal, and I heard the third living creature call out, &apos;Come forth!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">And behold, I saw a black horse right in front of me, and its rider was holding measuring scales.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">And I heard what seemed to be a voice from among the living creatures</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">saying, &apos;A small measure</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">of wheat for a day&apos;s pay, and three measures of barley for a day&apos;s pay,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">but don&apos;t harm</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">the olive trees producing oil and the vines producing wine.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">When he broke open the fourth seal, I heard the fourth living creature call out, &apos;Come forth!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">And behold, I saw a green</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">horse, and its rider&apos;s name was Death, and Death&apos;s Domain</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">followed him. They were given authority over a fourth of the earth, to kill with sword,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">famine,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">death,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">and by the wild beasts.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">When the Lamb broke open the fifth seal, I saw gathered under the altar the souls of those who had been slain because of the Word of God and because they had the testimony of the Lamb.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">They cried out with a loud voice, saying, &apos;Sovereign Lord, holy and dependable, how long before you judge those who live on the earth and vindicate</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">our blood on them?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Each one was given a glistening white robe.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">And they were told to rest a little longer, until the full number was fulfilled of both their fellow servants and brothers and sisters who were going to be killed just as they had been.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">And behold! I saw the Lamb break open the sixth seal, which released a powerful earthquake. I saw the sun become pitch black</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">and the full moon become bloodred.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">The stars fell from heaven to the earth, as a fig tree shaken by a stormy wind sheds its unripe figs.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">The sky receded with a snap&apos;as a scroll rolls itself up.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">And every mountain and island was moved from its place.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Then the kings of the earth and its great princes</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">and generals, the rich and powerful, and everyone, whether they were slave or free, ran for cover and hid in the caves and among the mountain boulders.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">They called out to the mountains and the boulders, saying, &apos;Fall on us at once!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Hide us quickly from the glorious face of the one seated on the throne and from the wrath of the Lamb,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">for the great day of their wrath has come, and who is able to stand?&apos;</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="7">
			<VERS vnumber="1">After this</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">I saw four angels standing at the four corners of the earth, and they were restraining the four winds so that no wind would blow on the land, on the sea, or on any tree.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Then I saw another angel ascending from the east,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">who had the seal of the living God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">He shouted out with a loud voice to the four angels who had been given power to damage earth and sea,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">saying, &apos;Do not damage the earth, the sea, or the trees until we</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">have marked the loving servants of our God with a seal on their foreheads.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">And I discovered the number of those who were sealed. It was one hundred and forty-four thousand,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">sealed out of every tribe of Israel&apos;s people.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Twelve thousand were sealed from the tribe of Judah. Twelve thousand were sealed from the tribe of Reuben. Twelve thousand were sealed from the tribe of Gad.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Twelve thousand were sealed from the tribe of Asher. Twelve thousand were sealed from the tribe of Naphtali. Twelve thousand were sealed from the tribe of Manasseh.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Twelve thousand were sealed from the tribe of Simeon. Twelve thousand were sealed from the tribe of Levi. Twelve thousand were sealed from the tribe of Issachar.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Twelve thousand were sealed from the tribe of Zebulun. Twelve thousand were sealed from the tribe of Joseph. Twelve thousand were sealed from the tribe of Benjamin.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">After this I looked, and behold, right in front of me I saw a vast multitude of people&apos;an enormous multitude so huge that no one could count&apos;made up of</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">victorious</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">ones from every nation, tribe, people group, and language. They were all in</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">glistening</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">white robes, standing before the throne and before the Lamb with palm branches</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">in their hands.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">And they shouted out with a passionate voice: &apos;Salvation belongs to our God seated on the throne and to the Lamb!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">All the angels were standing in a circle around the throne with the elders and the four living creatures, and they all fell on their faces before the throne and worshiped God,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">singing: &apos;Amen! Praise and glory, wisdom and thanksgiving, honor, power, and might belong to our God forever and ever! Amen!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Then one of the elders asked me, &apos;Who are these in glistening white robes, and where have they come from?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">I answered, &apos;My lord&apos;you must know.&apos; Then he said to me, &apos;They are ones who have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb and have emerged from the midst of great pressure and ordeal.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">For this reason they are before the throne of God, ministering to him as priests</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">day and night, within his cloud-filled sanctuary. And the enthroned One spreads over them his tabernacle-shelter.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Their souls will be completely satisfied.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">And neither the sun nor any scorching heat will affect them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">For the Lamb at the center of the throne continuously shepherds them unto life</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">&apos;guiding them to the everlasting fountains of the water of life.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">And God will wipe from their eyes every last tear!&apos;</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="8">
			<VERS vnumber="1">When the Lamb broke open the seventh seal, heaven fell silent for about half an hour.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">And then I saw the seven angels who stand before God, and each was given a trumpet.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Then the eighth angel with a golden incense burner came and took his place at the incense altar.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">He was given a great quantity of incense to offer up, consisting of the prayers of God&apos;s holy people,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">upon the golden altar that is before the throne.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">And the smoke of the incense with the prayers of the holy ones billowed up before God from the hand of the angel.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Then the angel filled the golden incense burner with</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">coals of</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">fire from the altar and hurled it onto the earth, releasing great peals of thunder, voices,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">lightning flashes, and an earthquake.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Then the seven angels prepared to sound their trumpets.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">When the first angel sounded his trumpet, there came forth hail and fire mixed with blood,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">and it was hurled to the earth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">A third of the earth was burned up, destroying a third of the trees</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">and all green grass.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">When the second angel sounded his trumpet, something like a huge mountain burning with</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">flames of</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">fire was thrown into the sea,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">destroying a third of the ships.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">A third of the sea turned into blood, destroying a third of all sea creatures.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">The third angel sounded his trumpet, and a megastar,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">blazing like a torch,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">descended from heaven upon a third of the rivers and fountains.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">The name of the star is Bitterness.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">A third of the waters became so bitter that many people died.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">The fourth</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">angel sounded his trumpet and a third of the sun was struck, and a third of the moon, and a third of the stars, so that a third of their light was darkened, and there was no light for a third of the day and likewise the night.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Then I saw and heard an eagle flying overhead, crying out with a loud voice, &apos;Woe, woe, woe, to the people of the earth, because of the next three trumpets about to be sounded by the other three angels!&apos;</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="9">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Then the fifth angel sounded his trumpet, and I saw a star that fell from heaven to earth, and he was handed the key to the shaft leading down to the pit of the deep.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">He opened the shaft of the bottomless pit and a</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">blanket of</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">smoke began to rise out of it, like the smoke of a giant furnace. The sun and the atmosphere were darkened with the smoke rising from the shaft.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">And out of the smoke appeared locusts</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">swarming</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">onto the earth, and they were given authority like that of scorpions</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">to inflict pain</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">They were told not to harm the grass, or any green growth or any tree, but only to afflict those who did not have the seal of God on their foreheads.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">The locusts were given authority to torment them for five months, but not to kill them. Their painful torment</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">is like the scorpion&apos;s sting,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">and during that time people will seek death but will not find it; they will long to die but death will elude them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">The locusts had the appearance of horses equipped for battle. On their heads were what seemed like golden crowns. And their faces were like human faces.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Their hair</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">was long</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">, like women&apos;s hair, and their teeth like lion&apos;s teeth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">They wore breastplates that seemed like iron, and their wings made a sound like the noise of horses and chariots rushing into battle.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">They had tails</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">and stingers like scorpions, with power to injure people for five months.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">The angel of the bottomless pit was king over them, and his name in Hebrew is Destruction</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">and in Greek Destroyer.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">This is but the first woe; there are still two more to come.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Then the sixth angel sounded his trumpet, and I heard a voice from the four horns of the golden altar before God,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">responding to the sixth angel, who blew his trumpet, &apos;Set free the four angels who are confined at the great river Euphrates.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">So the four angels were released, who had been prepared for the right hour, day, month, and year, to kill a third of humanity.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">I heard the number of soldiers on horseback&apos;it was twice ten thousand times ten thousand.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">And in my vision I saw the horses with riders wearing breastplates of fire and of sapphire</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">and of sulfur.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">The horses had lions&apos; heads breathing out fire and smoke and sulfur.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">They killed a third of humanity by these three plagues&apos;the fire, the smoke, and the sulfur that came from their mouths.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">For the lethal power of the horses was in their mouths and their tails, and their tails had snakes&apos; heads that inflict injuries.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Those not killed by these plagues did not repent of their deeds so that they would stop worshiping demons and idols of gold, silver, bronze, stone, and wood&apos;blind and mute idols that have to be carried around.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">And they did not repent of their murders or their sorceries</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">or their thefts or their immorality.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="10">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Then I saw another extremely powerful messenger</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">coming out of heaven, robed in a cloud. There was</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">a halo</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">over his head like a rainbow;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">his face</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">shined bright</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">like the sun, and his legs like pillars of fire.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">He held an opened scroll</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">in his hand. He set his right foot on the sea and his left foot on the land</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">and gave a tremendous shout, like a lion&apos;s roar. When he shouted, the seven thunders responded, rumbling out</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">their messages</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">I was about to write the messages of the seven thunders, but I heard a heavenly voice</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">say to me: Don&apos;t write a word, but place a seal on what the seven thunders have spoken.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Then the mighty angel whom I saw astride the sea and the land raised his right hand to heaven</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">and swore an oath by him who lives for an eternity of eternities, the Creator of heaven and earth and sea and all that is in them: No more delay!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">For in the day when the seventh angel is to sound his trumpet, the mystery of God will be fulfilled,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">just as he announced to his servants the prophets.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Then the heavenly voice spoke to me again: Go, take the open scroll from the hand of the angel who is standing on the sea and on the land.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">I went up to the angel who stood on the sea and the land and told him to give me the little scroll. Then he said to me, &apos;Take it, and eat it. It will be sour in your stomach</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">but sweet as honey in your mouth.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">I took the little scroll from the hand of the mighty angel and ate it. Indeed, it was sweet as honey to taste,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">but after I had eaten it, my stomach turned bitter.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Then they</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">said to me, &apos;You must</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">go back and</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">prophesy again to many peoples, and nations, and languages, and kings!&apos;</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="11">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Then a measuring rod, like a staff, was given to me and I was told: Rise and measure God&apos;s temple and the altar and count those who worship in it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">But exclude the courtyard outside the temple, for it has been given over to the nations, and for forty-two months</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">they will trample on the holy city.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">And I will authorize my two witnesses to prophesy, wearing sackcloth for one thousand two hundred and sixty days.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">These</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">two witnesses</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">are the two olive trees and the two lampstands that stand before the Lord God of the whole earth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">If anyone attempts to harm them, fire will flow out of their mouths and consume their foes. All who seek to harm them will die in this way.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">They have authority to shut the heavens so that no rain will fall during the days of their prophesying. They have authority over the waters to turn them into blood and to strike the earth with every plague imaginable, as often as they desire.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">When their testimony is completed, the beast that comes up from the bottomless pit will wage war against them and conquer them and kill them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Their dead bodies will lie on the street</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">of the great city that is symbolically</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">called Sodom and Egypt,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">where their Lord was also crucified.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">For three and a half days people from every ethnicity, tribe, nation, and language will see their corpses, because no one is permitted to bury them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">The entire world will gloat over them and celebrate and exchange gifts, because these two prophets had condemned</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">those who dwell on the earth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">After three and a half days God&apos;s breath of life</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">entered them and they stood to their feet, terrifying all who saw them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Then they heard a loud shout from heaven saying to them: Come up here! The two prophets climbed up into heaven in a cloud while their enemies watched.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">At that very moment there was a powerful earthquake and a tenth of the city collapsed, killing seven thousand people. The rest were terrified and gave glory to the God of heaven.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Now the second woe has passed and the third is coming swiftly.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Then the seventh angel sounded his trumpet, and a loud voice broke forth in heaven, saying: &apos;The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our God and of his Anointed One! He will reign supreme for an eternity of eternities!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">Then the twenty-four elders who sit on their thrones before God fell facedown before him and worshiped him,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">saying: &apos;We give thanks to you, Lord God Almighty, who is, and who was, because you have established your great and limitless power and begun to reign!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">The nations were furious, and you became furious, and the time for judging the dead has come. The time has come to reward your servants, the prophets and the holy ones and all who reverence your name, both small and great. And the time has come to destroy those who corrupt the earth!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Then God&apos;s temple was opened in heaven and the ark of his covenant was</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">clearly</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">visible inside his temple. And there were blinding flashes of lightning, voices roaring, startling thunderclaps, a massive earthquake, and a great hailstorm!</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="12">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Then an astonishing miracle-sign appeared in heaven.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1">the sun, and the moon was under her feet. She was wearing on her head a victor&apos;s crown of twelve stars.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">She was pregnant and was crying out in labor pains, in the agony of giving birth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Consider this</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">: another astonishing miracle-sign appeared in heaven! I saw a huge, fiery-red dragon with ten horns and seven heads,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">each wearing a royal crown. He was wearing seven royal crowns.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">The dragon&apos;s</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">massive</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">tail</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">swept across the sky and dragged away a third of the stars of heaven and cast them to the earth. And the dragon crouched before the woman who was about to give birth&apos;poised to devour the baby the moment it was born.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">She gave birth to a man-child who is about to rule and shepherd every nation with an iron scepter,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">and her son was caught up to God and to his throne.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">The woman fled into the wilderness, where God had already prepared a</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">safe</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">place for her, and there they nourished her for one thousand two hundred and sixty days.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Then a terrible war broke out in heaven. Michael</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">and his angels fought against the great dragon. The dragon and his angels fought back.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">But the dragon did not have the power to win and they could not regain their place in heaven.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">So the great dragon was thrown down once and for all. He was the serpent, the ancient snake called the devil,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">and Satan,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">who deceives the whole earth. He was cast down into the earth and his angels along with him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Then I heard a triumphant voice in heaven proclaiming: &apos;Now salvation and power are set in place, and the kingdom reign of our God and the ruling authority of his Anointed One are established. For the accuser of our brothers and sisters, who relentlessly accused them day and night before our God, has now been defeated &apos;cast out once and for all!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">They conquered him completely through the blood of the Lamb and the powerful word of his testimony. They triumphed because they did not love and cling to their own lives, even when faced with death.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">So rejoice, you heavens, and every heavenly being! But woe to the earth and the sea, for the devil has come down to you with great fury, because he knows his time is short.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Now, when the dragon realized that he had been cast down to the earth, he set off in pursuit of the woman who had given birth to the man-child.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">But the two wings of the great eagle were given to the woman so that she could fly and escape into the wilderness to her own special place, where she was nourished for a time, and times, and half a time, away from the face of the dragon.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Then the dragon spewed from his mouth a</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">raging</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">river of water to sweep her away with the flood.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">But the earth came to the rescue of the woman and at once opened its mouth and swallowed the river that the dragon had poured from his mouth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Then the dragon became enraged at the woman and went off to make war</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">against the remnant of her offspring who follow the commands of God and have the testimony of Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">And the dragon took his stand</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">on the sand of the seashore.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="13">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Then I saw a wild beast</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">rising from the sea with ten horns and seven heads. On its horns were ten royal crowns, and on its heads were blasphemous names.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">It was like a leopard with feet like a bear&apos;s,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">and its mouth like the mouth of a lion. The dragon shared his power, throne, and great authority with the wild beast.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">One of the heads of the wild beast seemed to have received a deathly wound, but the wound had been healed. After this, the whole world was filled with fascination and followed the wild beast.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">They worshiped the dragon because he had given the beast its ruling authority. They also worshiped the wild beast, saying, &apos;Who is like the wild beast? And who is able to make war against him?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">The wild beast was given a mouth to speak boastful and blasphemous words, and he was permitted to exercise authority for forty-two months.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">So the wild beast began to blaspheme against God, blaspheming his</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">holy</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">name and his dwelling place;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">that is, those who dwell in heaven.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">The beast was given the authority to wage war against the holy believers.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">And he was given authority over every tribe, people, language, and nation.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Everyone on earth will worship the wild beast&apos;those whose names have not been written from the foundation</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">of the world in the Book of the Life of the Lamb who was slain.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">If anyone has been given ears to hear, he&apos;d better listen!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">For the one who leads</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">others</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">into captivity, into captivity he goes. The one who kills</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">others</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">by the sword, by the sword he will be put to death.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">This is a call for the endurance and faithfulness of the holy believers.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Then I saw another wild beast coming up from the ground. It had two horns like a ram,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">but it spoke like the dragon.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">It operated in all the authority of the first beast on its behalf, causing the earth and its inhabitants to worship the first beast, whose mortal wound had been healed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">It performed great miracle-signs, even publicly causing fire to fall out of heaven to the earth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">And through these startling miracles that he performed on behalf of the first beast, he deceived the world, telling the people to erect a statue in the image of the beast that had been wounded by the sword and yet lived.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">The beast from the earth was empowered to breathe life</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">into the image of the first beast so that it could speak and kill those who refused to worship its image.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">It also caused everyone, small and great, rich and poor, free and bound, to be marked</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">on the right hand or on the forehead.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">This meant no one could buy or sell unless they had the mark; that is, the name of the beast or its number.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">This will require wisdom to understand: Let the one with insight interpret the number of the wild beast, for it is humanity&apos;s number</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="14">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Then I looked, and behold&apos;there was the young Lamb</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">standing on Mount Zion</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">and with him 144,000</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">who had his name and his Father&apos;s name written on their foreheads.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">And I heard a tremendous sound coming out of heaven, like the roar of a waterfall and like the earsplitting sound of a thunderclap. The sound</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">of music</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">that I heard was like the sound of many harpists playing their harps.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">And they were singing a</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">wonderful</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">new song before the throne, in front of the four living creatures, and in front of the</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">twenty-four</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">elders.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">No one could learn that song except the 144,000 who had been redeemed and who have not defiled themselves with women,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">for they are virgins,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">and they join themselves to the Lamb wherever he goes. They have been purchased from humanity and brought forth as the firstfruits</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">for God and the Lamb.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Their words are always true;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">they are without flaw.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Then I witnessed another angel flying in the sky, carrying a message of eternal good news</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">to announce to the earth&apos;to every tribe, language, people, and nation.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">With a loud voice he shouted, &apos;You must reverence God and glorify him, for the time has come for him to judge.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Worship at the feet of the Creator of heaven, earth, sea, and springs of water.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Then a second angel followed, declaring, &apos;She fell! She fell! Babylon the great is fallen! She once seduced the nations and made them all drink the wine of the passion of her harlotry!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Then a third angel followed them, shouting with a mighty voice, &apos;Whoever worships the wild beast and its image, and receives a mark on his forehead or on his hand,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">will also drink the wine of God&apos;s wrath. This wine has been poured out</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">and mixed in the cup of his indignation. They will be tormented</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">with sulfur</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">and fire in the presence of holy angels and of the Lamb.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">And the smoke of their severe suffering ascends into ages upon ages. Those who worship the wild beast and its image and receive the mark of its name will have no rest day or night.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">This is a call for the endurance and faithfulness of the holy believers&apos;those who follow God&apos;s commands and cling to the faith of Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Then I heard a voice from the heavenly realm, saying, &apos;Write this: Blessed are the dead&apos;the ones dying in the Lord</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">from now on.&apos; &apos;Yes,&apos; says the Holy Spirit, &apos;they will rest from their trouble, for their deeds will live on!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">I looked and behold&apos;I saw a white cloud, and sitting upon it was one like the Son of Man, wearing a golden crown and holding a sharp sickle.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Another angel came out of the temple, shouting out to the one sitting upon the cloud, &apos;Take your sickle and reap, for the time of reaping the harvest has come and the harvest of the earth is ripe!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">So the one sitting upon the white cloud gave his sickle a mighty swing over the earth and reaped its harvest.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Then another angel came out of the heavenly temple, and he too had a sharp sickle.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">And another angel came out from the altar</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">of incense</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">&apos;the angel with authority over fire. He shouted out with a loud voice to the one who had the sharp sickle, saying, &apos;Take now your sharp sickle and harvest the clusters of the vine of the earth, for its grapes are ripe.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">So the angel gave his sickle a mighty swing over the earth and gathered the grapes from the vine of the earth and threw them into the great winepress of the wrath</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">of God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">And the winepress was trodden outside the city</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">until blood poured out of the winepress as high as the horse&apos;s bridle</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">for a distance of one thousand six hundred stadia.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="15">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Then I witnessed another great and astonishing sign in heaven: seven angels bringing the last seven plagues, for with them the wrath</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">of God is finished.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">Then I saw what looked like a vast sea of glass blended with fiery flames. Standing beside the sea were those who continually conquer the wild beast, his image and the number of his name.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">They each held the harps of God and they were singing the song of Moses, God&apos;s servant, and the song of the Lamb: &apos;Mighty and marvelous are your miracles, Lord Yahweh, God Almighty! Righteous and true are your ways, O Sovereign King of the ages!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Who will not reverence you with awe, O Lord, and bring glory to your name? For you alone are holy, and all nations will come and bow in worship before you, as your blessings have revealed.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">After these things I looked, and behold, the inner sanctuary of the heavenly &apos;tabernacle of testimony&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">was opened before my eyes.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">The seven angels with the seven last plagues came out of the sanctuary in glistening robes of bright linen and golden sashes around their chests.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Then one of the four living creatures gave each of the seven angels a golden bowl full of the wrath</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">of God, who lives forever and ever.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">The sanctuary was filled with the thick cloud of smoke</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">billowing out from the glory and power of God&apos;and no one could even enter the sanctuary</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">until the seven plagues of the seven angels were completed.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="16">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Then I heard a loud voice from within the sanctuary telling the seven angels, &apos;Go and pour out on the earth the seven bowls of the wrath</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">of God.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">So the first angel poured his bowl upon the earth, causing ugly and painful sores to break out on the people who had the mark of the wild beast and worshiped his image.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Then the second angel poured his bowl into the sea, and it became like the blood of the dead&apos;every living thing in the sea died.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">The third angel poured his bowl into the rivers and springs of water, and they became blood. And I heard the angel of the waters say:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">&apos;O holy One, who are and were, you are righteous, for you have judged these things,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">because they shed the blood of your saints and prophets. They got what they deserved, for you gave them blood to drink!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Then I heard</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">a voice from before</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">the altar reply: &apos;Yes, O Lord God, the Almighty! Every judicial verdict you make is just and right.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Then the fourth angel poured out his bowl on the sun, and it began to burn the people with a scorching heat.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Though they endured the fierce heat, yet the people continued to blaspheme God. They cursed the name of God, who had authority over these plagues, and refused to repent and give him glory.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">The fifth angel poured his bowl on the throne of the wild beast, and its kingdom was plunged into darkness. People were in agony and gnawed their tongues</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">and cursed the God of heaven because of their painful sores,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">refusing to repent of their deeds.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">The sixth angel poured his bowl on &apos;the good and abounding river,&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">and it completely dried up in order to prepare the way for the kings of the east.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">Then I saw three unclean spirits like frogs belched from the mouths of the dragon, the wild beast, and the false prophet.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">They were demonic spirits</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">performing signs, and they entered into the kings of the world to draw them into battle on the great day of God, the Almighty.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">&apos;Behold, I come</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">like a thief! God&apos;s blessing is with the one who remains awake and fully clothed</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">in me</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">and will not walk about naked, exposed to disgrace.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">The demonic spirits assembled the kings together at the place called in Hebrew the &apos;Mount of the Governor.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">The seventh angel poured out his bowl into the air, and a loud voice came out from the temple and from the throne, saying: &apos;Here it comes!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Then there were flashes of lightning, voices, crashes of thunder, and a massive earthquake&apos;the most severe to shake the earth since the creation of man, so tremendous was that earthquake!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">It split the great city</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Babylon</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">into three parts, and other cities of the nations collapsed. For God remembered great Babylon and her winecup filled with his fiery wrath.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Every island fled away and the mountains were no more.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Enormous hailstones, each weighing nearly one hundred pounds,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">fell from the sky and struck the people, yet they continued to curse God because of the horrendous plague of hail.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="17">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Then one of the seven angels with the seven bowls approached me and said, &apos;Come, and I will show you the judgment of the great prostitute who sits</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">enthroned</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">on many waters.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">The kings of the earth have fornicated with her, and the people of earth are drunk on the wine of her prostitution.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Then the angel carried me away in the Spirit into a wilderness, and I saw a woman sitting on a wild, bloodred beast with seven heads and ten horns, and it was covered with blasphemous names.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">The woman was robed in purple and scarlet and was glittering with gold, precious stones, and pearls. She was holding in her hand a golden chalice brimming full with defiling obscenities and the filth of her lewdness.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">On her forehead was written these mysterious titles: &apos;The great Babylon, mother of prostitutes and of the abominations of the earth.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">I saw the woman was drunk with the blood of God&apos;s holy believers&apos;drunk on the blood of the loyal martyrs of Jesus. And when I saw her, I was utterly astonished!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">But the angel said to me, &apos;Why are you so astonished? I will reveal to you the mystery of the woman, and of the wild beast with seven heads and ten horns that carries her.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">The wild beast you saw once was, now is not, and is destined to ascend out of the deep and go to destruction. All those whose names have not been written in the Book of Life from the foundation of the world will be utterly astonished when they see the wild beast because he once was, now is not, and is about to rise.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">&apos;This requires a mind that has wisdom to interpret: The seven heads of the beast are seven mountains the woman sits upon; they are also seven kings.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Five kings have fallen, one is,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">and the other has not yet come&apos;and when he comes he must remain only a little while.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">The wild beast</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">that was but now is not represents an eighth king who is from one of the seven, and he is going to destruction.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">&apos;The ten horns that you saw represent ten kings who have not yet received a kingdom,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">but they and the wild beast are destined to receive authority as kings for</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">a short reign of</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">one hour.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">They are united in yielding their power and authority to the wild beast.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">They will wage war against the Lamb, but the Lamb will conquer them, for he is Lord of lords and King of kings! Those who are with him</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">will also conquer them</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">, and they are called &apos;chosen ones&apos; and &apos;faithful ones.&apos; &apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">And he said to me, &apos;The waters that you saw, upon which the great prostitute is seated, represent peoples, multitudes, nations, and languages.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">The ten horns and the wild beast will hate the great prostitute and will make her a ruin. They will reduce her to nakedness, and they will devour her flesh and burn her up with fire.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">For God has put it in their hearts to carry out his purpose for her by agreeing to give their kingdom</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">to the wild beast until the words of God are fulfilled.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">As for the woman you saw, she is the great city</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="18">
			<VERS vnumber="1">After these things, I saw another angel coming from the heavenly realm with great authority, and the earth was flooded with the brilliance of his splendor.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">He shouted out with a thunderous voice: &apos;Fallen, fallen is Babylon the great! She has become a demonic dwelling place, a prison for every unclean spirit, unclean bird, and every unclean, detestable beast.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">All the nations have drunk of the wine of her immoral passion, and the kings of the earth have committed fornication with her, and merchants of the earth have grown wealthy because of her power and luxury.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Then I heard another voice from heaven saying: &apos;My people, come out from her so that you don&apos;t participate in her sins and have no share with her in her plagues,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">because her sins are heaped as high as heaven and God has remembered her vileness.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">So repay to her double the same treatment that she has treated others with&apos; pay her back double for all her deeds and make her drink twice the brew she gave to others!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">With the same measure she exalted herself and lived luxuriously, give her that measure of torment and grief, because she said in her heart, &apos;I am no widow; I rule as a queen! I will never experience grief.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Therefore, her plagues will fall on her in one day&apos; disease, famine and mourning. She will be burned with fire. For mighty is the Lord God who judges her!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">The kings of the earth who fornicated with her and lived in luxury with her will weep and wail over her when they see the smoke of the fire that burns her up.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">And they will stand far off, in fear of her torment, saying: &apos;Oh no! You who were once the great and powerful city Babylon, now in one hour your complete devastation has come!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">The earth&apos;s merchants weep and mourn for her because no one buys their merchandise</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">anymore:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">their gold, silver, jewels, and pearls, their fine linen, purple cloth, silk, and scarlet cloth, all kinds of things made from expensive wood,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">ivory, bronze, iron, and marble,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">quantities of the finest cinnamon, spice, incense, frankincense, and myrrh, wine, olive oil, wheat, and the finest flour, sheep, cattle, horses, and their four-wheeled carriages, and the trafficking of the bodies and souls of people.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">And they will say: The splendid delicacies for which your soul craved have departed from you. All your elegance and splendor have disappeared, never to be seen again.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Those who sold these things and grew wealthy through their business with her will stand far off, terrified over her torment. They will weep and mourn, saying:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">&apos;How horrible! The great city that once clothed herself with fine linen and purple and scarlet cloth glittering with gold, with jewels and with pearls&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">in one brief moment such vast wealth is now laid waste!&apos; Every ship&apos;s captain and his crew, every seafarer and mariner, watched from far away</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">and cried out as they saw her go up in flames: &apos;What city was ever like the great city Babylon ?&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">As a sign of their dismay</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">, they threw dust on their heads and shouted with sobs and grief: &apos;How horrible, so horrible, O great city Babylon! For in one moment you suffered such destruction&apos; you who once made the merchants on the sea so very wealthy.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Rejoice over her, O heaven You apostles and prophets and holy believers, rejoice! For on your behalf God pronounced the judgment against her that she wanted to bring upon you!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Then a mighty angel took up a stone, like a huge millstone, and threw it into the sea, saying: &apos;With this kind of sudden violence, the great city Babylon will be thrown down and exist no more.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">The music of harps, minstrels, flutes, and trumpets will never grace your city again. No artisan of any trade will ever be found in you again, and the noise of factories falls silent.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">The light of a lamp will never shine in you again, Nor will the joyous laughter of a wedding be heard in you. Your merchants were once the tycoons of the world, But you deceived all the nations by your sorcery.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">For the bloodstains of the holy believers and the prophets and all who were slaughtered were all over you!&apos;</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="19">
			<VERS vnumber="1">After this I heard what seemed to be the roar of a great multitude of voices, saying: &apos;Hallelujah! Salvation and glory and power to our God!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">All his judgments are right and true, For he has judged the great prostitute who corrupted the earth with her sexual immorality. He has avenged on her the blood of his loving servants.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">And again they shouted: &apos;Hallelujah! The smoke from her destruction goes up forever and ever!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">The twenty-four elders and the four living creatures fell facedown and worshiped God, who sits on the throne, saying in</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="6">Then I heard what seemed to be the thunderous voice of a great multitude, like the sound of a massive waterfall and mighty peals of thunder, crying out: &apos;Hallelujah! For the Lord our God, the Almighty, reigns!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Let us rejoice and exalt him and give him glory, because the wedding celebration of the Lamb has come. And his bride has made herself ready.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Fine linen, shining bright and clear, has been given to her to wear, and the fine linen represents the righteous deeds of his holy believers.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Then the angel said to me, &apos;Write these words: Wonderfully blessed are those who are invited to feast at the wedding celebration of the Lamb!&apos; And then he said to me, &apos;These are the true words of God.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">At this I fell facedown at the angel&apos;s feet to worship him, but he stopped me and said, &apos;Don&apos;t do this! For I am only a fellow servant with you and one of your brothers who clings to what Jesus testifies. Worship God. The testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Then I saw heaven opened, and suddenly a white horse appeared. The name of the one riding it was Faithful and True,</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="12">secret</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">name inscribed on him that&apos;s known only to himself.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">He wore a robe dipped in blood, and his title is called the Word of God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Following him on white horses were the armies of heaven, wearing white fine linen, pure and bright.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">A sharp sword came from his mouth with which to conquer</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">the nations, and he will shepherd them with an iron scepter.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">He will trample out the wine in the winepress of the wrath</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">of God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">On his robe and on his thigh he had inscribed a name: King of kings and Lord of lords.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Then I saw an angel standing in the sun, shouting to all the flying birds of the sky, &apos;Come and gather for God&apos;s great supper!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Come and devour the flesh of the kings, generals, and soldiers, the flesh of horses and their riders, the flesh of all people, slave or free, lowly or famous.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">Then I saw the wild beast and the kings of the earth with their armies gathered to wage war against the rider on the</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">white</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">horse and against his armies.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">The wild beast was captured, as was the false prophet who had performed miracle-signs in his presence. (It was by these miracle-signs that he had deceived those with the mark of the wild beast and those who worshiped its image.) The wild beast and the false prophet were both thrown alive into the lake of fire burning with sulfur,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">and their armies were killed by the sharp sword that came from the mouth of the rider on the</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">white</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">horse. And all the birds gorged themselves with their flesh.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="20">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Then I saw a</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">mighty</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">angel descending from the heavenly realm, holding a heavy chain and a key&apos;the key of the deep.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">He seized the dragon, that ancient serpent known as the devil and Satan, and bound him for a thousand years.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">The mighty angel threw him into the pit, locked it, and sealed it so that he could no longer deceive the nations until the thousand years were over. (After that he must be loosed for a brief time.)</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">Then I saw thrones, and those who sat on them were given the authority to judge. I also saw the souls of those who had been beheaded because of the testimony of Jesus and for the Word of God. They had refused to worship the wild beast or its image and did not have their foreheads or hands marked by the wild beast. They lived and reigned with the Christ for one thousand years.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">This is the first resurrection.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">(The rest of the dead did not come to life until the thousand years were ended.)</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Wonderfully blessed and holy are those who share in the first resurrection! The second death holds no power over them, but they will be priests of God and of the Christ. And they will reign as kings with him a thousand years!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">After the thousand years are over, Satan will be let loose from his prison</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">and will go out and deceive the nations of the four corners of the earth, Gog and Magog.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">He will bring them together for battle, and they will be as numerous as grains of sand on the seashore.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">They spread out over the earth and surrounded the camp of God&apos;s holy believers and the beloved city. But fire came down from heaven and completely destroyed them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">Then the devil who had deceived them was thrown into the same place with the wild beast and the false prophet&apos;the lake of fire and sulfur&apos;where they will be tormented day and night forever and ever.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Then I saw a great, dazzling-white throne and the One who sits on it. Heaven and earth fled from his presence and they were no more.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">I saw the dead, the lowly and the famous alike, standing before the throne. Books were opened, and then another book was opened: the Book of Life. The dead were judged by what they had done as recorded in the books.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">And the sea gave up the dead</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">souls</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">that were in it. Then death and the underworld gave up their dead, and all were judged according to what they had done.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Then death and the realm of the dead were cast into the lake of fire, for the lake of fire is the second death.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">And anyone whose name was not recorded in the Book of Life was cast into the lake of fire.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="21">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Then</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">in a vision</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">I saw a new heaven and a new earth. The first heaven and earth had passed away, and the sea no longer existed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">I saw the Holy City, the New Jerusalem, descending out of the heavenly realm from the presence of God, like a pleasing</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">bride that had been prepared for her husband,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">adorned for her wedding</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">And I heard a thunderous voice from the throne, saying: &apos;Look! God&apos;s tabernacle is with human beings. And from now on he will tabernacle with them as their God. Now God himself will have his home with them&apos; &apos;God-with-them&apos; will be their God!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">He will wipe away</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">every tear from their eyes and eliminate death entirely. No one will mourn or weep any longer. The pain of wounds will no longer exist, for the old order has ceased.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">And God-Enthroned spoke to me and said, &apos;Consider this! I am making everything to be new and fresh. Write down at once all that I have told you, because each word is trustworthy and dependable.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Then he said to me, &apos;It has been accomplished! For I am the Aleph and the Tav,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">the beginning and the end. I will give water to all who are thirsty. As my gracious gift, they will continuously drink from the fountain of living water.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">The conquering ones will inherit these gifts from me. I will continue to be their God and they will continue being children for me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">But as for the cowardly,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">the faithless, the despicable, the murderers, the perverts,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">the sorcerers, the idolaters, and all deceivers,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">they will find their place in the lake of fire and sulfur, which is the second death.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Then one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls full of the last seven plagues came to me and said, &apos;Come. I will show you the beautiful bride, the wife of the Lamb.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">He carried me away in</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">the realm of</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">the Spirit to the top of a great, high mountain. There he showed me the holy city, Jerusalem, descending out of heaven from God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">It was infused with the glory of God, and its radiance was like that of a very rare jewel, like a jasper,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">clear as crystal.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">It had a massive, high wall with twelve gates, and each gate had an angel. Each gate had written upon it a name of one of the twelve tribes of Israel&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">three gates on the east, three gates on the north, three gates on the south, and three gates on the west.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">The city wall had twelve foundations, and on them were the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">The angel who spoke with me had a gold measuring rod to measure the city, its gates and walls.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">The city was laid out in a perfect square;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">its length, width,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">and height</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">were equal. So he measured the city with his rod, and it was 12,000</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">stadia,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">with equal dimensions for its width, length, and height.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">He also measured the wall at 144 cubits, according to the measure of a man, which is angelic.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">The city was pure gold, clear as crystal,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">and its wall was made of jasper.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">The twelve foundations of the wall</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">were adorned with every kind of precious stone&apos;the first was jasper,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">the second sapphire,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">the third agate,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">the fourth emerald,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">the fifth onyx,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">the sixth carnelian,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">the seventh chrysolite,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">the eighth beryl,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">the ninth topaz,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">the tenth chrysoprase,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">the eleventh turquoise,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">and the twelfth amethyst.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">The twelve gates are twelve pearls&apos;each gate made of one pearl. And the street of the city was pure gold, clear as crystal.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">I saw no temple in the city, for its temple is the Lord God, the Almighty, and the Lamb.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">The city has no need for the sun or moon to shine, for the glory of God is its light, and its lamp is the Lamb.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">The people</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">will walk by its light and the kings of the earth will bring their wealth</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">into it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">Its gates will never be shut by day&apos;standing always open&apos;because there is no night there.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26">People will bring the glory and wealth of the nations into it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">Evil</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27">will not enter, nor anyone who does what is abhorrent or deceitful, but only those whose names are written in the Book of the Life of the Lamb.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="22">
			<VERS vnumber="1">Then the angel showed me the river of the water of life,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="1">flowing with water clear as crystal, continuously pouring out from the throne of God and of the Lamb.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">The river was flowing in the middle of the street of the city, and on either side of the river was the Tree of Life,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">with its twelve kinds of</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">ripe</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">fruit according to each month</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">of the year</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">. The leaves of the Tree of Life are for the healing</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">of the nations.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">And every curse will</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">be broken and</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">no longer exist, for the throne of God and of the Lamb will be there</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">in the city</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">. His loving servants will serve him;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">they will always see his face, and his name will be on their foreheads.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">Night will be no more. They will never need the light of the sun or a lamp, because the Lord God will shine on them. And they will reign as kings forever and ever!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">Then the angel said to me, &apos;These words are entirely trustworthy and true, for the Lord, the God of the spirits of the prophets, has sent his angel to show his loving servants what must occur swiftly.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">&apos;Behold, I come quickly!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">Wonderfully blessed is the one who carefully guards the words of the prophecy of this book!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">I, John, am the one who heard and saw these things, and when I heard and saw it all, I fell facedown to worship the messenger who showed me these things.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">But he said to me, &apos;Don&apos;t do it! I am but a fellow servant with you and your brothers, the prophets, and with those who cling to the words of this book. Worship God!&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">And he said to me, &apos;Don&apos;t keep secret the prophetic words of this book, for the time is near.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">Let the evildoers be at their worst and the morally filthy continue in their depravity&apos;yet the righteous will still do what is right, and the holy will still be holy.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">&apos;Behold, I am coming quickly!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">I bring my reward with me to repay everyone according to their works.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">I am the Aleph and the Tav,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">the First and the Last, the Beginning and the Completion.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">Wonderfully blessed are those who wash their robes</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">white</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">so they can access the Tree of Life and enter the city</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">of bliss</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">by its</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">open</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">gates.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">Those</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">not permitted to enter</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">are outside: the malicious hypocrites,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">the sexually immoral, sorcerers,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">murderers, idolaters, and every lover of lies.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">&apos;I, Jesus, sent my angel to you to give you this testimony</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">to share with the congregations. I am the bright Morning Star, both David&apos;s</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">spiritual</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">root</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">and his descendant.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">&apos;Come,&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">says the Holy Spirit and the Bride</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">in divine duet</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">. Let everyone who hears</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">this duet</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">join them in saying, &apos;Come.&apos; Let everyone gripped with</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">spiritual</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">thirst say, &apos;Come.&apos; And let everyone who craves the gift of living water</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">come and drink it freely. &apos;Come.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">I testify to everyone who hears the prophetic words of this book: If anyone adds to them, God will add to him the plagues described in this book.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">And if anyone subtracts from the prophetic words of this book, God will remove his portion from the Tree of Life and in the holy city, which are described in this book.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">The one who testifies to these things says,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">&apos;Yes, I am coming quickly.&apos;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Amen! Come, Lord Jesus!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">May the grace of the Lord Jesus be with all the holy believers. Amen!</VERS>
